"Brandon of Indianapolis, IN",7/31/2000,,"Then I arranged to pick up the software and install it myself. After installing it, I found out that they didn't install a ethernet card or provide one which is supposed to come at no charge to the consumer. I offered to pick one up and install it myself, but they declined. Now they want me to schedule a 6th appointment. I am so tired of them pushing me around. Since I am forced to do cable through Comcast, there isn't a whole lot to do and they seem to be taking advantage of that. Can you help me on this?    "
"Renee of Philadelphia, PA",6/7/2001,,"I ordered cable internet service from Comcast Cable in December. We received our self installation kit, but were never able to get it set up properly. After several attempts at installing it, we basically gave up, no longer interested in the service. Admittedly, we were lax about having the service officially shut off. But since we never actually received service, we didn't think that we would be charged for the service. Renee should complain in writing to the Philadelphia city agency that licenses Comcast.  "
"Michael of Detroit, MI",6/25/2001,,"I ordered cable Internet service from Comcast on May 2nd. I knew I would be one of the first people in my market to get the service because it had not been available previously. I was sent a self installation kit as I requested, but then received a call saying that Self installation was not supported in Detroit, and I'd need an appointment to have an installer come out. So I promptly cancelled my service that day. Then I finally got a call from someone who actually works for Comcast in Detroit. He told me I never should have been sold a modem in the beginning of May, and that they are still going through detroit upgrading the equipment in some neighborhoods. Why doesn't anyone selling the modems know this? Why have they wasted ao much of my time? There's not one person at Comcast that has any clue what anyone else is doing. The national call center, which is where all calls for technical assistance are directed, is completely useless. They don't knoe what's going on in most local areas. Unfortunately for me, like many others, Comcast is the only choice for cable internet in my area."
"Andrew of Sunnyvale, CA",3/3/2003,,"We want to make others aware that Comcast is using poor communication and misleading information to their customers, and prima facia intend to charge cusomters more than agreed."
"Milton of Sacramento, CA",3/14/2004,,"I use the internet for various financial transactions . So far I have managed to work around this poor service and have not lost money, only time. When the comes that it finally does cause me a financial lose, I will take them to court."
"Bill of Burnsville, MN",4/29/2004,,"The advice from technicians has been everything from removing ribbon cables, disabling ALL firewalls, virus scans, etc. (by the way I have a brand new computer with plenty of memory) to the suggestion that my new computer doesn't have enough memory!!!! Dell 8200 series. I have received a host of generic emails, waited for hours on the telephone only to constantly receive a patronizing ""ping"" report and NO real help. I simply do not get what I pay for."
"Amie of Richmond, VA",5/4/2004,,"Comcast has been a constant problem since it took over our cable, telephone and internet services over 1 year ago from AT&T.; There has been intermittent service eruptions, poor picture quality and billing for services that we do not use and have not ordered. One issue I have is that Comcast is trying to force us to order its family networking service because we have a laptop in addition to our work station. I am so tired of this."
"Chilly of Centralia, WA",5/21/2004,,"For well over 3 years, my family and I enjoyed the benefits of having a home network system between just 2 computers, sitting side by side. File sharing across the network is one way we used our network. In our family, also, we enjoyed playing games with each other across the network. This, after all, seemed to be a safe way to allow our kids to enjoy the world of multiplayer gaming, but without the concerns of them interacting with strangers out on the web in gaming chat rooms.About 1 years ago, my wife enrolled in an online college program. She tried to manage with our mere telephone modem Internet access, but for all the obvious reasons (continuous disconnects, high internet traffic, etc.), it became necessary to get high-speed (HS) Internet access - something more reliable for her educational needs. With Comcast having recently dug up our street and installed the lines, and because they are the only TV cable company in our area, they seamed to be our only realistic option for HS Internet access.The Comcast installation technician was a gentleman, and was quite good, respectful, and new exactly what needed to be done. He installed one modem, then from that modem was attached our network hub. This gave both computers immediate Internet access. This was cool! After he left, and once our kids came home from school, we found, however, that we no longer could play games across the network. None of our file sharing or printer sharing capabilities existed anymore. We could go online and play multiplayer games just fine, individually, but not simultaneously. Though being a little PC hardware and software savvy ourselves, we still could not find a way to regain our home network capabilities.In frustration, and after a week of doing research, I learned something very disturbing - Comcast software, used for their HS Internet modems, automatically disables/sabotages home networks where they are installed; for another monthly fee, Comcast will come back (another day of work lost for me) and install their router that will enable my home network to work again, which, if you recall, worked just fine before they messed it up. Now remember, their technician installed one modem, connected our hub to it, and gave Internet access to both home PCs. No one said that our home network gaming and file sharing days were going to be over, UNLESS we paid them a monthly fee to fix something THEY disabled.OK, we may not be techno junkies, but were not entirely ignorant either. We went out to our local Radio Shack and bought a router. Problem solved. We got our network back, without loosing our Internet, and without being blackmailed into paying Comcast to fix something they  messed up. I really feel that Comcast was not forthcoming in explaining to this customer just how their HS Internet access was going to affect our existing home network. And, Comcast would not make right the problem that their hardware/software caused. Comcasts only solution was for them to come out, again, and install a router. And then, if that wasnt enough, they wanted to charge us $4.99/month/computer in our home that was on that network."

"Ash of Middleton, MA",6/1/2004,,"Honestly I'm switching to dish and DSL with a $40. Thats a nice saving is you ask me. One last thng I forgot to mention, despite 2 tech visit my lower channels are still fuzzy (despit new wiring and numerous checks to the line)."
"Joyce of Denver, CO",3/2/2006,,"I subscribed to Comcast's internet service. For the longest time I received nothing but spam. So I set up spam filters against **, Mortgages, etc. Then all of a sudden I was no longer receiving emails from family and friends. I allowed my daughter to use one of my mailboxes so that she could receive job alerts or email responses for applications for employment. Again, all spams but no job alerts. I contacted the so-called tech support and I got the run around several times. The excuse I got from Comcast is that there are filters that is preventing the emails. My question is this, why would a ** filter prevent emails from Monster.com? I asked this question and I was told that even though that there is a filter for Viagra, this filter can delete all emails. So I deleted the filters from my account and my daughter's account. Still no emails, but an occasional spam. Hmmm. I wonder what crook is lining the pockets of Comcast? I sent an email to the local Executive Assistant telling her that if this problem is not solved within 48 hours, I will cancel my account and sue Comcast. I also told the Executive Assistant that I will contact Qwest and order their DSL service. Fifteen minutes later my daughter receives almost 400 emails. Now all of a sudden she is receiving her job alerts. Over half of the emails were potential job prospects that she lost out on because of the idiots at Comcast. Now here we are back to square one. No more emails but a trickle of spam about two to three times a day. I have called the Corporate Office at least 40 times and still no solution to the problem. I have contacted the Office of Telecommunications and still nothing."
"Autumn of Knoxville, TN",3/6/2006,,"Ordered ""On Demand"" movie for the 1st time in Nov.2005. I get the bill, and there are charges for the movie I ordered, plus 2 additional movies. The 2 additional movies were ************movies, and one was in Spanish, and I don't even speak Spanish. And I was out of town when these movies were supposedly ordered. I called Comcast and had to wait for a supervisor to call me back 3 days later. The charges were finally removed, but they swore up and down that those movies were ordered thru my remote even though no one was in the house. So, here we are 3 months later, and I ordered 2 ""On Demand"" movies last month. Again, I was charged for 2 ************ movies that I never ordered. I called in and  talked to a smartbutt named Mike (refused to give last name or last initial) and he says that I ordered these movies. Again, I ask to speak to a supervisor, and again I am told they will have to call me back because they are ""busy doing other things"", according to Mike. I am irate, this proves that Comcast does not care about handling customer concerns, all they care about is making extra money.  I believe they chose to put ************ movies on my bill for 2 reasons: 1. they cost more than regular movies and 2. they think that people will be too embarassed to call in and dispute the charges. The management and representatives at Comcast should be ashamed to work for such an immoral company. I am trying to find other reasonable cable and internet service in my area, but Comcast has a lock on the market here. Thankfully I will be moving in the next 6-9 months anyway."
"Rich of South Hadley, MA",3/8/2006,,"Comcast was contacted about installong a cable modem for acess to the internet. Installer spent more time on his cell phone yelling at his girlfriend then he did with the install. Surprisingly(?), the modem refused to work, so he uninstalled all my Anti-virus and Firewall programs. Unfortunately, I had to work so my mother, who knows nothing about computers, was left to deal with this fool. I came home to a mess, the hard-drive was totally corrupted and full of viruses and spy-ware."
"Brandye of San Ramon, CA",3/12/2006,,"Last year, we bought the Nascar In Car package from Comcast.  They charge you 99.00 for the season but half of the season it didn't work so I would sit on the phone pushing buttons waiting to speak to a human being and time I would get to speak to one they would have to turn off my box and reset it.  By this time the race is about half over. This year we started with speaking to a supervisor and talking to her about the problem she assured me that it should be better well guess what.....it's NOT working, and of course on the weekend when the race is on NOBODY is at work at Comcast.  But the will credit me $5.00."
"Paul of Chicago, IL",3/12/2006,,"Their billing department is horrid. If you decide to use comcast (or are forced to), make sure you keep an eye on every single item on your bill. Also, when you sign up or change something on your account, make SURE you get a quoted price and the name of the rep. So far everytime I changed the services with them they have screwed it up. they bill it totlly incorrect, and when you call back they have no clue who did what. the relationship between the field technicians and CSA's is non existant, and even from the technician's say its horrible.   as a comcast customer, having cable tv and cable internet... you are actually treated like two different customers. Cable internet techs have no training on cable tv, and vise versa. So when you are trying to cooridinate billing, you have to switch back and forth between these departments, who you have to explain you're deal over and over again. i complained about his and they have this wonderful (sarc) Retension department. i believe these are people who have worked both tv and internet and know the packages and prices well, cause obviously no one there has ANY technical knowledge about the service.   my advice is to keep your changes and transactions and SIMPLE as possible."
"Bill of Dallas, TX",3/14/2006,,I canceled my cable tv on 1/28/06. I was told at that time that I have acredit coming to me. I have since been contacted numerous times about my bill being deliquent. I was then told that I had called and re-instated my service. A call that I did not make. I recieved a call on 3/13/06 confirming that a credit will be issued. I recieved call on 3/14/06 saying that I was delinquent in paying my bill. I told themthat they were harrassing me and that if it continued I would contact an attorney. they are making it very hard to cancel their service.
"Maria of Hollywood, FL",3/14/2006,,I have no cable service or intermitent service. I'm on my third set of cable boxes. I have requested to speak with a supervisor @ Comcast never returns my call or I'm left waiting on hold. They have sent to my home 2 repair techs and deliver old cable boxes that don't work. Thier solutions is to keep sending repair techs. I have to keep taking time off work with no resolution.
"Rey of San Jose, CA",3/19/2006,,I subscribed to their sevice to watch HBO fights and on a live fight with James Toney vs. Hasim Rachman me and my guests got to see the great introduction from Michael Buffer and then blank a screen. My brother tried to call this so called cable provider with promises that everything will be fixed in 3-5 minutes. Unfourtunatly the blank screen still appeared and silence and disapointment filled the air.
"Deborah of Tacoma, WA",4/4/2006,,"For the past 6 months I, the customer, have had to call each month and ask for a bill.  Numerous calls to Comcast have not fixed the problem and if I for get to call and ask for my bill (as I did in March) I am caught of guard with a $120.00 bill. I can not understand why this problem was not fixed after the first call instead of getting the company run around and the latest is ""oh we have a problem in the mail room"". At this point I will be transferring my services to another company.  All because a customer can not recieve a bill with out calling and having one generated.  Do you see a probelm here?"
"Marc of Beaverton, OR",5/26/2006,,"We got a cable modem. It can only handle one computer at a time. When I use my laptop it works fine but when I plug the cable into my desktop I have to reset the cable modem. Then when I want to switch back to my laptop, I have to reset the modem again. I called tech support and they think this is normal. It's not. With DSL you can simply plug in the cable and it works!I have to either crawl under the table to the cable modem every time I switch, or buy a router. "
"Sarwat of Washington, DC",6/15/2006,,"This is the second time I'm having trouble with Comcast. The first time was when I was getting my cable and internet installed. Due to the comcast's dispatcher's fault, I could not get hold of the technician even though he was in my building. The technician ended up leaving and I had to reschedule for an appointment later that day. Customer service was atrocious with one customer  service representative hanging up on me because I demanded to speak to her supervisor. I called back and described the situation to the supervisor who was completely unsympathetic to the fact that the dispatcher had messed up, that  one of his employees had been rude and the fact that I had taken a whole day off from work. He said I could either take the measly $20 inconvenience fee or nothing at all.   Three weeks later, the cable went out and I scheduled another appointment with comcast in the late afternoon. 1-5pm. at 2 08pm a Comcast dispatcher called me to confirm if I was still available for the appointment and I confirmed that I was. I called back Comcast around 3 to make sure if the technician was still on his way. The customer service representative confirmed that the technician had two more appointments ahead of me and would be here shortly. At 4 31, I spoke to another customer service representative who told me that the technician would be an hour late. Mind you, Comcast did not have the courtesy to call me and notify me of this, I had to call them myself. I called back at 5 31 to find out what the status was, and I was told to call back after 6, because there is a grace period of an hour for the technician to show up late. Again I was offered a measly amount of $20 for my 'inconvenience.'"
"Roman of Decatur, GA",6/21/2006,,"The turned off our cable, saying that the account is in abuse status. They wouldn't give a reason or send out a technician. They give us a number to a voice mailbox which is full and we can't do anything to get our service on. The cable is on the floor in accross the front door and people are tripping on it."
"Samantha of Chatanooga, TN",7/8/2006,,"Unresolved issues for over a month - constant disconnects, severe packetloss. After 3 tech visits in one week (not the usual contracted help for once) the problem still hasn't been resolved. Cable tv and internet cuts in and out randomly, house has been rewired, connectors have been reconnected, splitters have been replaced, ALL by comcast, still the problem cannot be found. Not to mention the ""your modem may be the problem"" excuse has come up once. My modem doesn't connect to my tv nor does it have anything to do with the problems I am having with the cable that runs into my living room and transmits through my tv. I have been told I will be credited fo the time that I have been having the problem once the issue is fixed. What about the days of work I have missed to make their 8-12. 12-7 appts?!!"
"M. of Oak Park, IL",7/21/2006,,"In 2003 I took advantage of a Comcast promotional offer of internet and cable.  The offer was that if you signed up for both you got basic cable and then if you added internet WITH CABLE you got an additional 60 channels (in essence the standard cable).  Before accepting this I checked with their rep and was assured that as long as I didn't change the service the price would remain the same.  Then early this year after four servicemen put in the wrong cable the last serviceman again put in the wrong service and downgraded my service.  Despite the fact that the bill has 2 lines; basic cable and Internet with cabel - Comcast refused to return my service to that contracted and kept telling me I only had basic cable (8.99) and had been getting standard cable for the basic price.  When I pointed out that I had internet service WITH cable and that this entitled me to the service I had been receiving for the past three years - they would completely ignore that aspect of the bill.  No matter how many times I pointed out the second line of the bill - it was ignored.  The next month my bill went from $54.00/mo to $22/mo.  Still they refused to acknowledge their mistake.  This month I finally figured out why.  It was so they could change the service and my bill to $45.00 for internet and $36.00 for standard cable.  They are such a devious, unscrupulous company that cannot be trusted.I'm paying more for less.  "
"Jennifer of Arlington, VA",7/25/2006,,"My cable went out 6 nights ago, and there is no solution in sight as far as getting it back. I have had to call them 3 times so far just to describe my issue and each time was on hold for 40 minutes.  Nobody seemed to know why I had no cable, no one is in any hurry to fix it and certainly, no one cares. Fine.  So the last answer I got (they have all been different) was that my cable will be back in, oh, a month or so. They really have no clue what they are doing.In the meantime, I got on the phone with DirectTV and after all was said and done, my DirectTV pacakge will be $20 cheaper per month than my Comcast bill. They will be here in a few more days, at which point I will cancel my service with Comcast with great glee.  "
"Bernard of Lancaster, PA",3/3/2007,,"Comcast Cable has been charging me for a cable modem which I have not used for over 19 months now. Each time I attempt to correct the situation, they do nothing about it. They have told me repeatedly that I will receive a new bill reflecting a credit but I have yet to receive and every time I call they again do nothing about this. "
"Mukesh of Modesto, CA",3/8/2007,,"I have had many problems in the past with Pay-Per-View charges on my billing statement that was not ordered by me or anyone in my house. Few months ago there was many PPV movies charged to me and I had to go through weeks of phone calls to have it cleared. They were nice enough to give me free HBO for a year for the trouble I had to go through. Now the charges have started to appear on my bill again and I called several times to complain. They have denied giving me credit this time because they said the charges are mine and they wont do it again. Money is not the issue here, I'd pay the charges anytime but the charges are not mine."
"Marilyn of Sarasota, FL",3/8/2007,,I want to lodge a complaint with comcast. I am very upset that the Simpsons show is on Limited cable and on at 6:30 and 7:00. It is terrible that children can watch this show. Not to mention South park! Get these shows off the limited TV stations. They are horrible for children.
"Douglas of Denver, CO",3/13/2007,,"I cancelled my service with Comcast on 1/11/2007 @ 1503 MST. I was informed that I owed them a Cable Modem which was placed on my work order from 9/18/2003. I don't have any proof that I bought & paid for the surfboard myself., but I did.What bothers me is that Comcast Cable sent me to a collection agency even before I received my final bill.  "
"Steven of Wayne, PA",4/11/2007,,"On or about January 27th, I contacted Comcast to cancel service, I was moving and lucky me, Verizon FIOS was in my new area.  I asked the Comcast operator where I could return my equipment to, and how long I had since I was leaving for vacation.  The operator told me one month was the limit.  I returned the equipment about two weeks after cancelling service; and two weeks after returning the equipment I received a bill for $413 from Comcast for equipment that was not returned, an HD Receiver and Cable Modem.  I called to rectify the issue and tell them in fact I did return the equipment.  I was told since I was no longer a current customer, an investigation what happened to the equipment would be started, and thet my final bill would recalculated once the investigation was completed. During the next two weeks, I repeatedly called Comcast as a followup, but was told they were still investigating.  On April 4th I received a collection letter from Eastern Account Systems of Connecticut on behalf of Comcast. I was in debt to comcast and they were retained to collect the debt.  I called the collection agency but they closed at 5 PM Daily. I called comcast, complained, and paid via credit card, and also paid the $4.95 surcharge to have an operator process my card.  The operator stated she could not see any investigation conducted on my behalf.  Was it all a lie by Comcast?  I called the collection agency the next day to inform them the debt was paid, and how poorly Comcast has handled this issue. ...  I've never had a late payment in my life outside of the nonsense from Comcast.  As a Dept of Defense employee, I need to file any collection/debt issues for review to ensure I am not a security risk.  It is a lot of paperwork that Comcast and Eastern Account System of CT have caused me, which could have been avoided had Comcast shown me some courtesy/competence and resolved the issue.  I will go witout cable before going back to Comcast."
"Ren of Savannah, GA",4/13/2007,,"Talked to 6 reps, with each giving different answers about cable cards for the newer  TV.  Finally I picked up a card to find out what I would receive.I found my TV picked up less channels and did not pick up what they said it would pick up for digital starter.I would need to purchase two /packages up just to receive the channels they have taken.  Not to mention they say we get 77 channels but truth is we get 68 and losing channels as time goes by, but they will not reduce the price.They bait you to the next two higher priced tiers at $77.00 form $50.00.I can get more if I take their box and remote at no cost, but I bought this TV with cable card ability so I would not have to get box and another remote. Their cable card does not have two way communication like their box does so I can not receive on demand and other channels?  So now I am losing channels and my rate is not going down.This amounts to a rate increase and if I buy another package this amounts to another rate increase.I agreed to pay X and now they fail to deliver."
"Linda of Decatur, GA",5/28/2007,,"I am without services on the internet for 24 hours. I would love to be sending this message from my home service, for which I pay a handsome price.  Instead I am at local wireless friendy cafe. Apparently I need to be on their server rather than Comcast.Unable to do do college class work, etc."
"Milton of Byram, MS",6/9/2007,,"Recently Comcast merged with Road Runner in our area.  I have had Road Runner for several years and didn't mind paying for decent service, but since the merger and rate increase I am looking for a different carrier.  Daily, the box has to be unpluged and wait for 15 to 30 minutes then started over again.  They admit to knowing that they have this problem but had no second thoughts about that rate increase.Lets see - worse service, higher prices.  What a way to keep customers!"
"Reginald of Arlington, VA",3/3/2008,,"Bad cable installation services, it is not working properly. I contacted Arlington county cable administration and nothing has been done . "
"Victor of Homestead, FL",3/5/2008,,"Around half a year ago I started having a problem; it's been nearly 2 years since I've been with Comcast with the Internet and cable combo. I got Comcast for it's High Speed Internet service and it was all great until a few months ago. Whenever I tried downloading stuff like my friend's Flash videos he makes to test, while using Bit torrent to download it,  the service started to either go from 168Kbps to nearly 5 Kbps or just completely disconnect and appear as if it never existed.  It does this also with live web cam chats slowing or freezing on me, websites not loading and everything slowing down except for a few important websites. Then I saw the report about them using some programs to scram the connections and control what they want and don't want for us to see. And at the moment, I'm just waiting to see what happens to the problem that the FCC is investigating. I also have had several times where the entire cable connection is gone due to an outage; however, it has only happened to me and a few on our neighborhood--along with some channels being randomly either censored or taken out. I had to quit flash video and gaming testing. I've lost connection to several sites and games I've paid for."
"Carmela of Beachwood, NJ",3/6/2008,,"I have had Comcast Cable, Internet and phone services for approx. 6 months.  I transferred to COMCAST from  Verizon because it sounded like a good  deal and also because the rep was a great salesman.  I had NO problems up to now!  In the past month, I have received numerous calls and have  placed numerous calls, and people cannot hear us, but we can hear them. I  called customer service, and they opened a ticket for a tech to come and  verify the installation. The tech said that everything was done  properly, but I still have the same problem.  I called customer service again with the same problem, and again they  sent somebody to inspect our lines. The tech informed us that he has  known about this problem, and it's a problem Comcast has in the area.    I called customer service again to complain.  Tech has been  here 3 times, and I still have the problem.  I run a business from my  home due to my disability (MS) and am working for a psychologist. I now have to call patients back  using my cell phone!  This is not the kind of service I expected. A  supervisor named Lorna was supposed to call me back yesterday, 3-5-08, but guess she is too busy.  Just wish someone would tell me what the problem is and if it is going to continue.   Do I contact the FCC?  PLEASE someone help me out here!  I've lost minutes used on my cell phone.  In case of an fire/emergency and cell phone not available, I would have no way to call for help."
"Tara of Forked River, NJ",3/9/2008,,"Since November 07' I have had nothing but problems with my service. After about 20 phone calls in december with no luck I decided to take my box to manahawkin to exchange. I was given a new one.two weeks later my box stopped working so they sent someone out to 'fix the lines' they told me there was nothing wrong with my lines it was the box so they replaced. two wekks later my box was not working again, so they sent some one out again to 'fix the lines. they replaced to box again and checked the signals and said there was nothing wrong with lines it was the 'new box and replaced again. the again a week later someone had to come again to 'replace the box! this was in january 08, numerous amounts of phone calls and I asked them if I could be credited at least something and they said no but maybe 40.00 that is a joke considering my bill is about 100.00 a month!! now here it is march 8 and I awoke to noe cable and no internet again! I called for three hours and finally got thru and they said someone would be out from 12 to 4 today. they never came. so at 5 I called and they said no one can come until tuesday the 11th and that no one should of told me that. so when I asked for a supervisor she (camille hung up on me) so once again I called back to get a supervisor and was told now there were outages in my area,even though all my neighbors had service but me! "
"Jeremy of Pleasanton, CA",3/11/2008,,"I recently moved apartments in the same complex, approximately 2 buildings down from where I currently live.  I called Comcast to transfer service, and things were going fine until I was hit the the transfer fees.  Now I know where these guys make the money.  First I was being charged $25.99 for the reconnect fee.  Then I was asked how many TV's I had.  After I told them 2, I was then hit with a $13.99 charge to activate the second jack in the apartment.  Let's sum this up: $25.99 - Reconnect Fee; $13.99 - Additional TV Fee; $18.00 - Monthly Bill. To get setup this month with their service, it's going to cost me close to $58.  Every other company I worked with to transfer my services offered it free of charge.  I don't know how Comcast can actually get away with this, but I don't plan on being with them much longer."
"Mindy of Orem, UT",3/12/2008,,"My phone is not working, and I checked everything: the cords are all plugged in and the light is on."
"Caroline of Plantation, FL",3/12/2008,,"There is simply not enough time and space to explain the difficulties we have had with Comcast's cable television service.  At times, the screen and various channels are blacked out, with a nice little message stating your channel will be available shortly.  Apparently the space time continuum is off in their neighborhood, as the channels often take days to come back on.  When the channels do work, they are pixilated, and the sound is often out of sync with the pictures. I am down to about 5 usable channels that I do not truly care to watch.  Does Fox own Comcast, because Fox news apparently never has any problems!  Customer service repeatedly tells me the problem is on my end and refuses to refund me the difference for my time and effort."
"Russell of Indpls, IN",3/18/2008,,"How can they take channels off the sports pack but continue to charge you the same?  Namely the NFL network. I pay $120 to watch TV and they just do what they want.  And there is no choice of other companies.  Hello monopoly!The consequence is they still get the same money for a lessor service, not the one you signed a contract for!"
"Joseph of Newfield, NJ",3/19/2008,,"I was a Comcast customer.  Their service was a constant problem which they were called on time and time again.    They said the problem is over here, it's over there, on and on and never any resolve.  Finally they said I'd get a credit for 12 months.That never happened and now they are trying to collect for a service they couldn't supply."
"Gina of Knoxville, TN",3/27/2008,,"My internet service went out so we called Comcast. They were not able to get it back up from their office and sent a service tech.  He found the modem was bad and replaced it.  I just got my monthly bill and found I was charged a $32.99 service call fee. I was not told before the tech was sent out that there would be a charge if the modem was replaced nor did the tech tell me. I was told this is standard and they charge a fee if the modem is replaced.  To avoid paying the service call fee you either have to take the modem to Comcast or pay a monthly $3.00 protection plan fee.   Yes, that's right, pay Comcast $3.00 per month to avoid a service charge if the equipment you are renting from Comcast goes bad."
"Susan of Lansdale, PA",3/29/2008,,"1) When I switched from basic cable to digital with HD service, they had a lot of trouble figuring out how to set it up with TiVo, even though I called them several times before-hand to make sure they could handle it (which they said they absolutely could). They had to come out twice to finish the job. And even after that, I had to call them to configure the system correctly.  2) Each month, they charge me for an additional outlet, even though I am only watching on one television, because I have a dual-tuner TiVo. They did not tell me that was going to apply ahead of time and I really don't think it's fair.   3) My high-speed internet connection with them is slower than my former DSL connection. I sat for over three minutes just waiting for this page to load! I don't understand how it can be marketed as high-speed. "
"Sarah of Dearborn, MI",4/1/2008,,"I signed up for Comcast service through www.comcastoffers.com in July 2007.  I was promised three rebates for the following amounts:  $100, $30, & $50.  I mailed in the rebates (correctly filled out, I have copies) before Sept 1st.  I changed addresses after that, and provided the website my updated address on October 25th.  The company's records indicated that all three rebates were sent to my old address and marked as paid in their system.  However, I only received the $100 & $30 rebates.  The company stated they would reissue the $50 rebate on 12/10 in 6-8 weeks.  I still have not received the rebate.  I just submitted another help ticket to their website, and will be sending them a certified demand letter.   I have not been paid $50, and I will have to pay the cost for sending a certified letter."
"Uday of Plainsboro, NJ",4/2/2008,,"I am a new customer and took cable TV services from Comcast in mid Jan 2008. Meanwhile I took Internet services through Comcast offers ($19.95/month) in the month of Feb 2008.   Problems: 1. I am still being charged for $42.95/month for internet. I was asked to submit the mail-in-rebate forms for the $19.95/m offer to start. In-spite of sending the mail-in-rebate to Comcast, I am being charged $42.95.   2. During the month of March, Comcast was upgrading the cables in my area and I was without internet service for 3 weeks in a row after the upgrade was completed. In-spite of regular follow-ups, no one was able to fix the problem. Only after escalating the issue, the issue was addressed. During these 3 weeks I have lost lot of time, peace of mind and money.  3. I was told that I'll not be charged for the duration I did not have the services, but I have the bill in my hand now and I do not see any discounts.  4. Whenever I call 1-800-comcast either the call is disconnected or they try to misguide me. had to disturb my friends during night because I had to send some emails. I use Vonage and I was without phone for 3 weeks. It was a huge risk as I did not have anyway to reach my pregnant wife at home. I had to travel every day to my office (in New York) even though I wanted to work from home when my wife was not feeling well. Every day follow-up with Comcast was painful and mental torture."
"Douglass of Richmond, VA",4/8/2008,,"I joined Comcast because they said they supported Tivo, so I bought a Tivo HD; when Comcast came to install their cards the cards would not work. Now Comcast is telling me they never supported Tivo. My response to them was if that's true why were their techs. at my house trying to install the cards. They won't let me speak to anyone in authority nor will a supervisor return my calls. Yet they are screaming about my unpaid bill."
"A. of Wheat Ridge, CO",4/9/2008,,"This relates to attempting to disconnect service when I moved out of state.    In Early February, I called to cancel my internet account effective FEBRUARY 22, 2008.   Then I got a bill and called, because I had called to cancel, but was being charged.  I moved out of the house on February 22, 2008.  I expained this to the person with whom I spoke.  She told me don't worry.   She said they had recorded the disconnect with the February 22 effective date, but had not yet sent someone to the physical address yet to disconnect the service.  However, my Incorrect billing would be fixed as soon as THEIR TECHNICIANS went to do thier job!  I thought the issue had been resolved.  Appearently not.  Because  TODAY I got a NASTY & AGGRESSIVE voice mail message demanding I call to arrange to disconnect my service as new owners wanted to set-up their internet.  I HAD CANCELLED ALREADY!!  I called a SECOND TIME was told A SECOND TIME it would be addressed.  Instead I got hostility and still am being charged for services cancelled in a home I no longer own!  My decision now is not to use Comcast for either cable or internet here in Seattle.  Hopefully they won't screw with my credit.  However, as I have a bill with a past due (again for services twice cancelled in a home I no longer own) I don't put anything past them! I expect I will bet a hit on my credit report for not paying for service in a home I don't own.  Mostly, the consequence to date is frustration and hours of stress."
"Mary of West Lafayette, IN",4/11/2008,,I am a teacher and need access for parent/teacher communication as well as using an online substitute teacher program.  My husband is a police officer and information is often sent to him via our email.  Not only is this a problem regarging our jobs but I should not have to pay for a service that is not being provided.
"George of Sunrise, FL",4/14/2008,,"This all started when we had a problem with Comcast, we were on a promotional agreement with Comcast and they broke it. They sent us our monthly bill and from the previous month the charges had increased over 100% without any notice. These charges are unreasonable fees and again without notice that the charges were being made. We did not agree to any said charges. They broke the contract without any notice & when we refused to be taken advantage of they threatened me with a made up charge for discountinued the service which again is very unreasonable. These practices are unprofessional to say the least and we would like to join the class action suit against them, as far as Direct TV, almost the same situation. We contacted them on November 30th 2007 to take a promotional offer they had sent to us in the mail for $34.99 for a period of 9 months with bonuses. We get our first bill and to our surprise we were charged full price for everything with no promotional prices.The $34.99 turned into over $90.00 This has been a real nightmare for the last 5 months. Every month has been something different and every person at both companies that I have spoken with tells me something different. This is really a bad problem and from what we have been told and heard we are not the only people dealing with this problem. Again, I wish to join the class action suit against these companies and try to stop these companies from doing this to other people. I have already received a notice for not paying from both of these companies which isn't right since I didn't agree to any of these charges. I need assistance with this matter ASAP from someone there.These 2 companies are threatened to tarnish my credit which is in the high 700's and I have been an upstanding citizen in my community for over the last 20 years. I'm a retired fire fighter and have served the people so I feel I need assistance here with this problem before it goes any futher. I just want these companies stoped from the bad business practices and before they can do more damage than they have already done."

"Beverly of Chicago, IL",4/15/2008,,"On February 9, 2008, I talked to a representative. He tried to walked me through the connection process. It was not completed because I had the Wi-Fi connection. The agent I spoke with knew that I was not connected and so nothing was done since then.  But, I did receive a bill for services I never used.  I am very upset by Comcast reaction and most of all why are you charging me?  Your record show that my services was never connect so why am I being billed.  Businesses should not charged people for services that was never received. I don't understand. Please review my account. Your people need to understand also that people do not want or need to pay for services they do not receive. "
"Margarita of Lowell, MA",4/16/2008,,"In February, as a long time Comcast customer, I changed my services from regular digital cable to in demand cable with high speed internet and telephone. I was a user of the high speed internet and the cable, just I need was the phone service with Comcast.However this was the damage, so to add the phone service was only 33.00dollars more so the new package that I have to pay was 99.00 for two years for digital cable, high speed internet and phone. So I agreed to pay 99.00 plus the installection fee that was 30.00 dollars for just the phone. When I received the bill Comcast charge me $500.00 dollars, when they told me that to change to have the 3 services in one package, looking for savings I got this bill.I called them which was a hard time because most of the time I called they hand out my phone call and when finally I spoke with one of they customer care they say that will scan my account and will change those crazy charge that are not suppost to be there. I wait for the result then when I recieve the bill this month they charge again more fees and did not clear my record now I have a 500.00 dollars bill that I do not know where here in Massachusetts I can go a clear this mess because I am trying to be a good customer and look what this company is doing to me. I use comcast because of the advange of the internet that can help me a lot with my work at home and with my research, but this is not reason to scam me. So please if there an attorney who can advice me and tell me what can I do?"
"Mark of Lebanon, IN",4/21/2008,,"When Comcast took over our cable service from Insight Communications they decided to shutdown the Insightbb.com domain.  This means that after years of using my Insight email address, I will have to hunt down and find everywhere I've used it to change my email address.  I had no choice in the change.  I did not want Comcast as my cable provider.  Now I have to deal with this and there is nothing I can do (short of canceling their service where there are no other choice of cable TV).  Comcast refuses to compensate me for my time and trouble.My time and effort to track down and change my email for sights that I may not even remember after 5 years of using the same email address."
"Sean of Spokane, WA",4/21/2008,,"Comcast is monopolizing us, a city of 180K lower than national median annual wage customers makes TV more expensive than food! We pay more than ANY other place in the USA for this rip-off, they up the cost 2-3 times per year dropping Ch's as they go, unless you have a HD $5K set! The New World Order of cable TV mobsters!I know of MANY folks who can no longer afford cable TV so they stick rabbit-ears up and get 3 broadcast free channels, some go with satellite, cheaper but bad weather cuts service U still have to pay for for 2-3 months per year! Comcast has Spokane by the throat and keeps squeezing the life out of us."
"Steven of Somers Point, NJ",4/24/2008,,"I signed up to Comcast for the High Speed Internet service. I have been a customer for about a year. I download large files at home and I also up-load files at home also. Apparently Comcast offers a connection to it's customers for 100 Mbps. I have used my task monitor to monitor my speeds and I have never seen any speed downloading any faster than a total of 800 kb per second, meaning 1 tenth of the bandwidth but at a higher price. On the uploading side, they offer 8 Mbps, but the highest speed you get to upload is around 47 kb per second. Far lower than the advertised speeds. I also noticed that Comcast claim to be on-line 24/7 is not real. If I have a peer to peer program running in the backround, I find that my connection has been lost and my computer has been reset or restarted resulting in loss of work performed.  I am also a serious gamer, who plays video games on servers with 50 other peers online at a time. I find that my ping ratio is far greater than the other players. An average ping rate should be between 80 and 150. My ping is variable between 300 and 800, close to 5 times the average. So where is the benefit of Comcast? My service is supposed to be a clear cut line to Comcast, but I find that my line is piggy-backed along with other lines, cutting the benefit of high end users to satisfy the masses, while still charging top dollar across the board. I also realized early on, when you sign up for the Comcast High Speed Internet, they try to sell you the upgraded service for more money. But Buyer beware, because for the more expensive package there are no better results, in fact the results are exactly the same, same bandwidth in the up and down slope as mentioned earlier, therefore when signing up, go for the minimum cost. I spent more money per year on Comcast services than if I had gone with another company offering the same deal on internet services for less, but received the same bandwidth in the up and down slope as Comcast had offered."
"Dwight of Memphis, TN",4/25/2008,,"I called Comcast to inquire about its phone service.  On Wednesday, April 23, I spoke with the sales rep, PEARL, and obtained pricing, service features, installation specs.  I was prepared to sign on, but I told Pearl that I wanted to check with some other carriers and was going to review the information, which she had given me, with my Mother.  Pearl told me that her computer was down and she could not process any further.  Pearl asked me to call her back on Thurs, April 24 at 11:00. I call her back at the specified time, spoke to another operator, who told me that Pearl was busy with another customer and that Pearl would return my call. (She never returned my call)  While I was talking to that operator, I attempted to logon to my online account.  I was blocked from entering online and a pop-up message indicated to me that security provisions had been added.  The pop up instructed me to enter a PIN, which it alleged been mailed to me.  I had no such number.  The pop instructed me, if I forgot the PIN, to indicate such and the PIN would be sent to my email.  That didn't happen either.  Friday morning at approximately 10:30, I called Comcast to rectify the security clearance on my online account.  I was informed that the security had been added under fed law to secure my phone service.  I was futher informed that service tech was schedule to arrive at my house between 10 and noon THAT DAY, to change the phone lines.  I was further informed that a new phone number had been assigned. I told the customer service rep, Carolyn,  I NEVER AUTHORIZED ANY OF THIS.  She thought it strange too, because there were no indications in her notes of my authorization and that the new number and service tech has been dispatched within the statutory three days.   I would never have known that the phone service was being change had I not inadvertently gone online to look at my cable/internet bill.I spent more than two hours on the phone with Carolyn cancelling the unauthorized phone service and getting my online account security clearance.  The scary part is these people could have changed my phone service with my authorization, and reassign me a new phone number without my authorization."
"Kimberly of Swedesboro, NJ",4/27/2008,,"Unfortately I am writing to inform you of by bad experience with Comcast.  It all started on 4/12/08 when I called Comcast to have our line checked out.  For the past couple of months we were losing our cable as we use it for VOIP with AT&T and Comcast for High speed for our computer.  I called on this day 4/12 to explain what was happening and Comcast immediately sent a tech out to the house... better than good customer service as company replied asap.  The technician determined that the underground line had to be replaced as it was bad.  He stated that the utility company would be out on Monday 2 days later to mark the ground for utility lines... so I took a day off from work on Monday so I could be home to let them know that they only had to mark one side of the house as we wanted the new cable run to our garage rather than running it twice the distance around the back of the house and come into our living room.  My husband decided it would be less work and he said it would be easier to have the moden, router and VOIP box located in the garage in one easy to reach to location.  Well, Monday came and went and no one showed up.  After 4 phone calls to Comcast througout the day I was told on the 4th call by a CSR that at 4:00 that day my service was canceled.  It was about 5:00 when I called.  I asked why they canceled it and they stated that the tech said no new cable was needed... well that can't be true, we were losing signal, he checked it out and stood in my living room, and stated it was bad and on top of it, gave me a yellow service sheet stating in his own writing that there was a bad drop need new.  I was not happy to hear this as I took day off of work to be home and no one showed up.  The last CSR explained that if we continue to have problems to call back.    So from this moment on, I am thinking okay, I'm nuts, and I guess I will have to wait for it to break again before I call back.    The week of 4/24, I came home from work and there was blue and green spray paint outlining my underground utilities, I then thought, okay Comcast canceled their part of the job, but did not cancel the utility company from coming out.  So I did nothing... well on 4/24 on my day off, a knock came at the door, it was a sub-contractor who notified me that they were at my home to run new cable.  Now I am thinking okay, what's going on.  I called Comcast to tell them that new cable had been run and when were they sending the tech out to hook it up... well guess what, Comcast stated, we have no order for you... what a surprise.  Once I told them the entire story, they set up for a tech to come out the following day on the 25th to hook up the new cable.  But here is the bad news... during the dig to lay new cable the sub contracted company shoveled through my main sprinkler system pipe that runs into my house and busted it wide open.  It's white PVC.. they explained that they made the error and would fix it the next day.  Well the next day on the 25th, no one showed up... yet another surprise.  Along with this, the tech who came out stated that because we ran the new cable into the garage rather than running it where it was before to the living room that he could not hook anything up because it needed to be grounded... running it across the back of our yard to where it was before would have been a nightmare.. we have a paver patio that they could not get under thus having to run it all the way around our pool to the other side of the house... so this hook up never got done and Comcast will not do it until my husband puts in a ground.    So the story continues, now I have a gaping hole in my yard with a broken main sprinkler line... that never was repaired.  I spent 1/2 my day on my cell phone calling Comcast and asking to speak to a manager to help get the water line fixed today 4/26... as it was due to rain for the next 4 days and cannot get mud and have the hole fill with water, I explained I wanted the repair done today.  After several calls, much agravation and many hours of my day, I finally got a hold of someone who in my opinion was the best at helping me. She had a service manager who I cannot remember his name along with her pushing to get this fixed asap.  Finally they contacted the construction co. (by my recommendation) who had passed the repair off to a landscape company to fix.  The landscape company made it out today to repair the break, but would have been out sooner had they received from the sub contracted company who ran the cable my name and phone number to get a hold of me, which they did not, but after the woman I spoke with at Comcast and this unknown manager got involved they solved this mysterious puzzle, got me in touch with the landscape company to fix the problem.  Over the past 2 weeks, I cannot name every person at Comcast I spoke to, although I was very disappointed in the lack of good customer service.  Every time I called I had to explain over and over the situation, I asked on several occasions to speak with a supervisor and not until today and 4 hours later did anyone call me back.    If only we had DSL in our area, I would have canceled with Comcast and signed up with DSL... but unfortunately for us, Comcast is the only high speed we could get at the time.    Comcast is a very large company, I know this, but don't let size fool you as with continuous bad customer service, [they] will lose customers.    I hope [they] take this email into consideration and if only one other customer get's better service from this feedback than I've done my job.  Broken sprinkler system main line. Day off of work 4 hours of phone calls, which equals my time and phone bill charges"
"Nancy of San Rafael, CA",4/28/2008,,"I have Comcast internet and have been very happy with the service until they changed their website.  Now, when I try to access my email via the website, I am able to see some of the messages until I receive an error message saying Login Failed.  This originally happened once or twice each week. Now it happens almost every time I check my email!  I have called Comcast repeatedly and every time they tell me to change my password.  This works for an hour or two and then I begin getting this error message again.  They are either complete idiots and have no idea what's going on with their system or they do know but don't want their customers to know this.  I am getting very frustrated with the lack of an effective response from Comcast but they seem to have the high speed internet market all wrapped up.I use my email for work so I cannot respond to my clients in a timely manner when this happens.  Also I have spent endless hours on the phone with Comcast but their so-called fixes don't work for very long."
"Alissa of Annandale, NJ",4/28/2008,,"Due to the recent acquisition of Patriot Media, I am now a Comcast customer...and a very unhappy one at that.  I have now been without telephone service for one week and, less importantly, internet for three days.  After multiple calls to Comcast during the first days of the telephone outage, my husband and I were told some of the following things:  There are only certain call centers who are handling your area, but you cannot speak to them.  Please hold while I talk to them about your problem.  Can't you just use your cell phone?  You were not entered in our database prior to the switch-over of service.  The problem is with your modem.  The problem is on our end with the communication between our system and your modem.  There is nothing I can do to help you.  You will have to wait for a call back to schedule a service call since you are not in our computer.  And, as of today, someone who was probably the most honest yet:  If we cannot figure out the problem, we will not be able to provide telephone service to you.  Ok, so I get that there are growing pains with any merger/acquisition, but this is ridiculous.  If Comcast could not handle the customers of Patriot Media, they should NEVER have taken over the company.  So, when we first started calling, they kept telling us that we couldn't be scheduled for a service call because we weren't in their database.  But they opened a ticket and would have someone from the designated call center give us a call to set up a time.  The call-back never happened.  So, my husband and I took turns multiple times a day calling them back to get someone to do something productive.  We kept hearing the same thing about the call center and they couldn't help us (blah, blah, blah), and then I decided to search Comcast's website for a complaint email address.  I found one for the VP of customer service.  I'm no idiot, so I know it's a general mailbox, but within two hours of submitting the email I received a call from the corporate office in Princeton, NJ.  The woman was very nice to me, but ultimately, couldn't help me.  She DID, however, schedule a service call for Sunday morning.  The tech came, replaced the modem, but couldn't get the phone to work because the tech in the office was too busy to put our new modem info into the database while the other tech was still in our house.  I knew that was trouble.    So, here we are...7 days and counting with no phone, and 3 days without internet.  So, I called this morning and immediately asked the customer service rep. for her supervisor.  I got one, and asked him if Comcast even knew what the underlying problem was.  He admitted that they do not, and if they can't figure it out, they're just not going to be able to provide phone service to us.  WOW!  So, because Comcast bought our cable company, and we were forced to switch to their service, and there are now major problems that they can't figure out, my family is just supposed to accept the fact that we may not be able to have our phone through the cable company anymore.  So, if that happens, Comcast will just raise the rates of the cable because we can't have the triple package.    I don't think I have ever dealt with a company as inept and unethical as Comcast.  If you do have a choice for your cable, internet, and/or phone, DON'T CHOOSE COMCAST. Most importanly, my family has had no access to 911.  Also, I work from home two days a week to save on gas and mileage.  Now that I have no phone or internet, I can't do that.  Also, the emotional stress that my husband and I have been under just trying to get our phone restored has been daunting.  The attitude that Comcast has taken (We bought your cable company, your phone doesn't work, there's nothing we can do to figure out the problem, so tough) is appalling."
"Pat of New Market, MD",4/29/2008,,"Since COMCAST took over Adelphia Cable in the Frederick, Md area the quality of the cable picture has deteriorated 99%. The video signal is crap! You call in a trouble and if you ever do get someone, which usually takes 15-45 minutes, the canned answer is you are the only one in your area experiencing the trouble. And if your neighbors are experiencing the problem and dont call in COMCAST does nothing BUT they will send out a tech 1, 2, 7 days later to check and leave a nastygram on your door sayinh you missed your service appointment when one was never made. I have dealt with Comcast in everypart of Maryland and they have not changed. Lousy, lousy video quality and even lousier Customer Service.Video quality is sub-par and I work for a major communications utility in the broadcast video installation and service market."
"Sherry of Manchester, NJ",4/30/2008,,"I subscribed to Comcast bundled package (cable TV, Internet, Phone) in Feb. 2003 with a 24 month contract. Since that time I have had problems with the internet and phone service.  I have a record on file with Comcast of problems and visits by technicans dating back to Feb. 15, 2007.  The problem still exits.  A technican was her again today and internet service dropped several hours after he left.  I want out of this contract without penalty.  My husband and I both work from home offices with calls being dropped and no email service costing us business."
"Joseph of Nd Hgts, NJ",5/1/2008,,"i have a problem with comcast cable co,i have been overcharged with cable,i called them to correct bill they said they would ckeck problem,i just paid bill ,174,00 the next day they shut off service,then they said they would turn it back on for another 236.00,i gave them 410.00 dollars that month, this month i get another bill this month for 393.89 dollars, a couple of months ago i signed a contract for 159 00 a month,but bill has never beencharged that amount.this problem has been going on for years,i have call this company several times, spoke to there supervisors, but nothing has been corrected,if you dont pay ,they shut you down,this is terrible that they can do what ever they want,i tried calling there corperate but i could not get throught, please hele me with this problem. thank you"
"Dan of Cooper City, FL",5/2/2008,,"Comcast came to house and switched us over  to their all in one (phone/internet/cable) package. This complaint is about the internet. Since their install, our virus protection and other programs cannot go online for updates. Calls to their tech support result in either being put on hold and then the call dropped (3X), or not understanding the problem at all. Finally a tech stayed with the call and after wasting 15 minutes, said he would write up a ticket for a tech to handle it, which would take up to 72 BUSINESS hours (today is Friday.). I thought I was ALREADY talking to a tech, but evidently the people they use on the first line of customer service (if you can call it that) really are not equipped to do much. One can sense this by their general cluelessness and frequent inability to retain a phone call. If this is any indication, COMCAST hi speed internet maintains one of the worst tech support centers I have encountered anywhere. The bottom line is that their installation screwed up our computer and they dont seem in any rush whatsoever to make it right... they have their upfront installation fee and the customer be damned. Consumers BEWARE!Without virus protection or online backup until this is resolved, and judging from their support I doubt they will resolve it anytime soon."
"Maureen of Springfield, IL",5/2/2008,,"We've had constant problems with Comcast since they took over our cable service from Insight.  We had autopay set up with Insight which we were told would transition over to Comcast.  That clearly did not happen.    A month or so later we suddenly lost service.  When we contacted Comcast we were told we lost service because of nonpayment.  Comcast hadn't properly set up or transferred the autopay provisions.  After 2+ hours on the phone with various Comcast service represenatives Comcast restored our cable and internet service and set up the autopay.  Tuesday we again had our service shutoff for nonpayment even though Comcast had assured us the account had been rectified and autopay set up.  Again we spent 2-3 hours on the phone with Comcast trying to get the situation straightened out.  Once again Comcast assures the problem with the account and autopay has been corrected, but we're left wondering whether we get to look forward to another 2-3 hours on the phone with Comcast at the end of May.  The height of irony is that in the middle of the hours on the phone the other night, another employee from Comcast called to see how things had worked out after our call two months ago.  Needless to say, we're angry and looking into alternatives for internet access and TV."
"Lesheika of Paducah, KY",5/6/2008,,"Every month I get a bill with no due date. It will say billed from 4/23-5/23 but do due date. When I call comcast, I get several different responses. Sometimes, I get the 3rd of the month, or other times, I get the 14th of the month. Which one is it? Well, aside from that due to me only getting paid once a month, my bill to them is always past due. So then I am stuck with a $7.00 late charge fee. It use to be $5.00. I don't know when they changed it to $7.00, because I was never notified in any of the billing statements. I have never know anyone to charge for your payment being late, especially not that much. $7.00 is alot of money, for being a couple of days past due...do they not realize that things do come up, and sometimes, like with me only getting paid once a month, I usually miss my due date. They are always raising the prices for their crappy service. Thank God, I only use their internet! I would NEVER use them for anything else. With everything being so high from groceries to gas, it is ridiculous to charge $7.00 just because your payment is late. Is there anything legal we as a people can do to stop these money hungry giants? This should be considered stealing money from those that support comcast through having their services. It's just ridiculous."
"Jeremy of Oakland, CA",5/6/2008,,"I had set my TiVo to record Globe Trekker, for the episode including Iran. Guess what happened? ONE HOUR OF BLACKED-OUT PROGRAMMING!GREAT IDEA, COMRAD-CAST!I was unable to watch the episode I was looking forward to viewing. Why should Comcast use their prehistoric political angles to keep me from watching a program that encourages viewers to get along with the rest of the world?! There has to be a legal precedent involved in this kind of instance."
"James of Spotsylvania, VA",5/7/2008,,"On January 2, 2008, Comcast Service reps showed up because I was not receiving internet service.  They replaced the modem and restrung the cable from the box out front to the house, about 200 ft of cable.  In April, I called to complain about the cable not being buried.  They set up a service visit (unneccessary) for Good Friday.  Of course they never showed and when I called they said the appointment had never been made.  I explained my problem and, again, set up an appointment.  A rep came out and said yes, I needed to have the cable buried and that Miss Utility would show up soon.  It's now May 7, going on 5 months with the cable going diagonally across my yard making it difficult to mow.  A neighbor said he had to cut his 3 times before they came out and buried it but I can't do without the internet service since I work out of my home."
"Julia of Houston, TX",5/7/2008,,"Asked for installation and they caused damage. After over a week trying to have them come out to fix, they finally came to resolve.  During this whole time the comcast people have agreed that some new wiring needs to be put in to have the correct service and they still haven't sent anyone out. Call, after call, does not produce a result.  I could go on and on, I just want the service I am paying for.I waited for a service tech on a Friday evening wherein service was promised no later than 8 p.m......no one showed.  The attic ladder they broke was left open for almost a week during winter months before someone came out and fixed it.   Much time spent calling and calling and getting redirected to someone else, over and over and over.  Total adjustment after all was said and done ---- $20."
"IrÃƒÂ¨ne of Fort Myers, FL",5/8/2008,,"I have return my modem and all to this office 4/24/08. I disconnected service with Comcast Hi Speed Internet as I sure would not pay $8.00 monthly to go on hold (not knowing when I'd be back, as asnowbird). [They] in fact owe me and yet you are still billing me.  No damage, just error in billing"
"Christie of Salt Lake City, UT",5/8/2008,,"I cancelled my cable TV on 4/24/08.  I contacted customer service after receiving my bill with the cable TV charge still on it.  I was informed that it is standard procedure to bill customers for an extra month after they cancel their service.  At no time was I informed of this BEFORE I started service with them. I will be paying for cable TV until June, even though it was disconnected almost 2 weeks ago.  I cancelled because I did not want to pay full price after being told when I wanted to cancel my service previously that my package pricing of TV and internet would be extended for another 6 months to keep me from cancelling.  The next bill I got was at full price, and when I contacted them about this, I was told that I was lied to and that I had to pay full price.I am paying $55.45 for absolutely nothing, in addition to the $34.40 I have already paid because I trusted that they would extend the package pricing as promised."
"William of Burgettstown, PA",5/8/2008,,I ordered service through comcast which included cable tv and internet at a price of 66 dollars for the package...I had to order a modem at a one time price of $50.00 plus tax which I gave them my credit card information to charge it on there..Then I was directed by there sales team to the installation department which informed me that service is not available in my area.I then asked them how do I stop this order from taking place? They informed me that I would need to talk to they sales department and get them to cancel it..So I get directed back to them and at that point they say they have no record of my name phone number or address in their system....So a day later I checked my account in sure enough it has been charged a fee by comcast...I call them back in still no record of me ordering service through them.The loss of about 65.00 dollars and they endless amount of time I spent on the phone with these people who continually put me on hold to give me no answers of why they can't find me in their system..
"Carrie of Boston, MA",5/9/2008,,"We signed up for a basic cable and Internet package when we first moved to East Boston. Because we are in East Boston we HAD NO CHOICE of a provider. Comcast sent us a modem that kept working poorly, shutting off, and disconnecting. I contacted customer service twice about the problem--the first time they told me I had to increase my plan to get a better modem. The second person actually told me that I had a poorly made, out of date modem. My boyfriend took the modem back to a Comcast agent at a location. He said he waited in a long line full of angry customers, most returning faulty modems. The rep was not helpful, and rude in fact. We purchased our own modem, for $80, and not it works fine. Needless to say, our first four months of service was at a cost, for shoddy service. They refused to give us any money back or reduce the bill. I can't wait until we get another provider in the area, or move.$80 for new modem, $12 in fees, and additional wasted time on the telephone (phone bill costs)- 3 hours or so."
"Satyanarayan of Little Rock, AR",5/9/2008,,"3 months ago, I signed up for Comcast Tripple play (cable, internet and digital voice) at a special promotional price through a third party vendor, Anderson. Anderson had a kiosk in Walmart, north Little Rock and persuaded me to sign up for this deal. As per the deal, I was going to pay $70 per month for this package in the first 6 months followed by their regular price of $99 per month for the triple play package. There was a promise of repayment of $350 by check through coupons. The package also included free subscription to premier channels (such as HBO) and HD channels for 1 year. Anderson took my details and gave me a confirmation number saying some one will contact me from Comcast in the next couple of days. Two days later I got a call from Comcast enquiring the time to establish the service. During this conversation, it became apparent that the caller was not aware of the special promotional package and was trying to sell me with the regular price of $99 per month. I refused to accept this offer and mentioned about the offer being sold by Anderson. A couple of days later, I got a call from Ms Kathy Greenbaum as well as a representative from Anderson. The Anderson rep told me that the package they offered me holds good and Comcast should honor it. However Ms Greenbaum told me that there was some miscommunication between Comcast and Anderson with regards to pricing. After much deliberations over the next 2 days, she called me back on my cell phone and offered me the same package at a revised price at $82.50 per month for six months followed by regular price of $99 per month. Local Comcast technician came and installed the equipments in the next 2-3 days. I had multiple interruptions with my internet connection for which I called Comcast customer services. This issue is not completely resolved. In the meantime, I noticed that I was charged more when I received my first month's bill. I tried to bring to Comcast's attention about the descrepancy in the monthly invoice and the special package I was promised. I sent them an e-mail about 3 months ago, and have made at least 4 different calls to Comcast customer service on this matter. Once it was a Saturday. As the local office was closed, the call handler told that he will pass on my issue to the concerned persons in the local office. He promised that some one from Little Rock Comcast office would call me on the following Monday. As no body called me over the next 2-3 weeks, I made another call to their call center and spoke to one named Steve. He expressed his inability to help me as it was a matter for the local office and transferred my call to Ms Kathy Greenbaum in Little Rock. She was not available in her office and I left a message on her voice mail explaining my situation clearly. This happened on March 31st, 2008. However, I did not hear from her at all. As I was having no luck and was wasting a lot of time on the telephone, for the following billing cycle, I just paid $82.50. In the first week of May (1-9), I was on a vacation. When I returned home on 5/9/08, I was surprised to see that my Comcast service (telephone, internet and television all three) were disconnected. I called them again on 4 different occasions on May 9th and spoke to Mr Jonathan Ross, Ben and Sherry. I spent more than 2 hours on the telephone. They told me that there was an unpaid balance for $92 for which, my service was disconnected. When I explained the situation again - about my previous attempts to contact them and the promotional package - Mr Ross and Ben promised to call me within few minutes. They never returned the call. Mr Ross had given me his direct telephone number which was on voice mail. He did not respond to my message left on the voice mail. Later in the evening, I paid the amount for $92.50 when I spoke to Sherry as they were not prepared to restore my service until I paid.1) I have suffered economic damage a) because of inflated price and b) because of wastage of my time spent on telephone 2) Psychological stress due to the feeling of being cheated by Comcast"
"James of Naperville, IL",5/10/2008,,"ive been calling about a dangerous electrical amplifier that has been wiyhout a cover for a year.then 3 weeks ago comcast ran a cable wire across my yard from corner to corner. i called comcast 7 times about the open electrical box, still no one came out. i called may 5,2008 was told they would be out may 6 , 2008 no show .i called may 8 2008 was told they would be out may 9 2008 no show. i called may 9 2008 talked to a supervisor michael id# mas. thats all he would give me. i explained about the wire accross my yard, and the saftey hazzard with the open amplifier . i told him my grandchildren play in the yard and it could be dangerous. his answer was to keep the kids out of there oun yard. not comcasts yard but my yard. he said they would be out in 2 weeks"
"Charles of Greenbrier, TN",5/11/2008,,i cannot check e-mail during the day.I work at night so during buisness hours I surf the internet and catch up with e-mail.When I try to connect to the e-mail server I get a default message that states cannot connect to inbox at this time try again later.This is a home use connection so I get bumped from the server by buisness customers.I should not have to contine paying full price for internet if I do not get full service.
"Gerald of Grand Rapids, MI",5/11/2008,,"First off both my wife and myself run our businesses' from our home. We have an at home office with faxes and 4 computers.  We need internet and of course phone service.  We have Comcast Cable, Internet, phones & television.  We have trouble with all of it and cannot get anything resolved with Comcast at all.    I am CONSTANTLY being kicked off line right in the middle of something.  Or, kicked off during the middle of a phone call, if that is, I can actually get the phone call in, or out, in the first place!?   while on the phone, many times, I can hear the person on the other end however, they cannot hear me or visa versa.    Sometimes, we just simply get disconnected.  Boom!  Phone call ended.  Internet gone.  Sometimes, we can reconnect or redial, other times not.  Sometimes it's only for a few seconds, other times, for several minutes,  other times, the internet is a problem for an entire day.    I am told by Comcast, that the problem is NOT in my home. The problem is a Comcast problem.  So, that eliminates the need for anyone to have to enter my home yet, each time, they come over, check the same crap IN MY HOME, tell me the same thing and go away with nothing changed.  These problems with Comcast is a DAILY occurrence and usually it happens many times throughout the day!!!   This has been an ongoing issue with Comcast for well over a year!!  It has not gotten better and in fact, during the past few months has gotten considerably worse instead!    No matter what I do and no matter what they do or promise me, the problem has never even once been resolved.    They claim that a supervisor will be out to look at the problem and it will be fixed tomorrow.  I have as YET to have even seen ONE supervisor let alone, talk to one.    They send the same people come out that can do nothing but tell me the same thing.  You have to much power coming into your home and/or, not enough power going out.  The problem is NOT in your home, it is between the telephone lines and Comcast.  We will have it fixed immediately.  Yet, nothing is ever resolved.  It is so damn frustrating and time consuming it's pitiful!!  I am losing my ability to contact my clients and their ability to contact me. I am receiving complaints from them as well but, there isn't a thing I can do to prevent it.  I am positive that not all phone calls are reaching my home office.  No calls = no business...    We try sending faxes, get disconnected half way through.  I can't count the amount of time I've spent redoing an email because I got kicked off line or the amount of time I've wasted talking to these idiots from Comcast on the phone.  All, no to avail."
"Tracey of Marietta, GA",5/11/2008,,"I was a comcasy customer, I was paying my bill on time I had a credit of 40 something dollars. My husband called me and told me that the internet was down so I called comcast to let them know. When I called me phone call was sent to account services because they said that it was a past due balance of 485.00 I said there is no way. Some one had called into to comcast and the money was reversed on my account, but they didnt have no details to why and how, Well come to find out that my ex called comcast and got my address as well as the payments that had been made to comcast. They ask that I fax in a copy of my bank statements and they would credit the account back, after faxing the bank statement to them twice they still have not credited my account back, and still have a balance of 400 and something dollars. Not only that they gave out my address to him and he is not to come near me or call me. A customer service rep said it had to be a inside job, and you should get your money back but they have yet to give it back. Also when we frist ordered service the guy that came out was rude he said that he did not have time to look for a connection and besides he was late. I told him to leave and I called for a nother guy to be sent out. Well they guy they sent out complained about hooking up as well. My husband got on his knees and do most of the work for him. I have stopped using comcast and would never use comcast again. What about the Hippa law they told me they dont use the hippa law they have there own law and hung up on me. I have had to move because they gave out information to some one that has physical hurt me and my children, and that has called every day since he got the number and address. We also have had to have our number changed."
"Bill of Chicago, IL",5/11/2008,,"ABSOLUTE HORRIBLE Comcast customer service in Chicago My Comcast cable goes out every 3 weeks - like clockwork.  This has been going on since January 2008.  It is now early May 2008.  When I go into the Main Menu -> Cable Setup -> Display, it shows Disconnected - Not Connected. I tried to explain this to Comcast and was told my cable is out because the box was physically disconnected and I needed to re-connect the box.  What ?  If the box was disconnected, how am I able to go inside the Cable Main Menu and read this to them?  This proved that Comcast knows NOTHING about their equipment nor how it's works.  I have called Comcast easily over a dozen times and what do/did I get: 1) Hung-up on. 2) Techs no-call, no-show. 3) Lied to - Repeatedly by Comcast about the scheduled day/time when the tech was suppose to arrive.  This part is really really bad and apparently legendary.  Countless times I was told that a tech will to arrive between 8 & noon or between 1 & 5PM and like an idiot, I waited - and waited - and waited - and waited.  Called Comcast, like every hour to check on my scheduled appointment: no clue, I mean totally clueless - hugh waste of time.  I was told they have no control over dispatches.  And yet, you have to contact them to schedule a dispatch.  4) Techs, if and/or when they do show up, have absolutely no clue on what is the problem and apparently why they were dispatched - I guess they are told to just show up. 5) And most importantly, tech not fixing the problem as my cable went out Tuesday, May 06 and is still out.  The few and I do mean few techs that did show up told me the following: the problem is with the signal - the problem is not with the signal - the problem is outside - the problem is inside - when this happens, to call Comcast and have them send an INT signal to the boxes.  This is like wiping out and re-sending the cable box configs any Favorite Cable Channels settings are gone.  But you have to beg and plead with Comcast to do this and this is a TEMPORARY FIX.  A few weeks later, cable goes out.  Another tech told me directly to -my -face to call Comcast and cancel the service as this would get their attention to fix the problem.  I could not believe a Comcast tech was telling me to do this.  At others times I was told that the tech would come out and replace both HD cable boxes.  Techs, again the few that did show up, were empty-handed - no replacement cable boxes.  Techs did not know what I was talking about when I asked where were the new boxes.  Comcast told me that they were sending out a tech to replace the boxes.  Their reply was they were not sent to replace anything - and then asked, once again, what is the problem?   It is as if for the past 5 months, I have been talking to an empty phone in an empty room.  Again, tech shows up with no clue on the reason they were dispatched - they just show up - and even that's a maybe - they may show up or they may not.  No one knows.  I have been in the customer support field for over 10 years with many different companies and have NEVER seen such BAD service as Comcast.  It is as if they are deaf, dumb and blind to the ability of providing SERVICE to their CUSTOMER.  Isn't that what they are suppose to do ??  Customer Service means giving Service to the Customer.  Where is the follow-up call to the customer to confirm that they are back up and working?  Where is the call to the customer to let them know the tech is running a little late?  Or cannot make the scheduled appointment?  Why do I, the customer have to call the provider to find out what is going on?  What is needed is another cable provider in Chicago.  I will take ANYONE/ANYTHING over Comcast,  I wish I could get satellite service, but I live in a condo that faces East. For satellite service, like Direct TV, I need to have an unobstructed view of the southwest sky.Apparently I am left with no choice but to cancel service as the cable goes out at will with no fix and no cares/concerns from Comcast.  None at all.  I pray to God in Heaven to please let Verizon FIOS, RCN, WOW-Wide Open West, or ANYONE get in my area and provide cable television service - and FAST!"
"Spencer of Chicago, IL",5/13/2008,,"I had a appointment set for 8-12 on 5/12/08 and never had any body arrive, I called to ask why no one was here and they said that the technician was outside after looking outside I told the rep that their was no one outside, she indicated that they were going to get a part and would be here at my house within 20 minutes, I stood outside and waited with nothing, I even had lawn people in the yard for these hours and they even were looking out for the technician.   I called back and spoke to Latoya and she told me she was the manager and she fixed the mistake and was sending someone out to do the job today 5/13, well needless to say 4:30PM came around and I started calling they told me that the appointment was set for 5/14 1-4PM, now I have taken 1 entire day off work to get my service corrected and now your Scheduling Dept, took it into their own to reschedule me with out my knowledge, heck I have had all the neighbors on the look out, but Nothing.   Now they expect me to take another day off for their error. I am writing a letter to the BBB the state and the local media to address these horrible consumer relations department, I am also contacting the investors on this site to share the horrible experience I have had again with your company, if you look at the original order a year ago this same crap happened and I was credited for the months it took to get service, this is a clear indication that your company is not doing the right thing as far as service and knowledge of the procedures at hand and not even making the money I as a consumer am willing to pay for true service.   Yet another horrible experience with Comcast and to think I pay you guys monthly for this type of service, I feel that maybe I should take your equipment outside and slam it on the porch and order from a company who cares about their consumers.   I pay you guys 130 a month and the internet connection is bad so this is your error not mine, but I am the one paying for this by having to deal with your horrible Service representatives at the Woodridge Il. location.   I spoke to Latoya who clearly lied about the reschedule only to get me off the phone and to a manager by the name of Arlo & Andrew, Andrew just kept putting back in queue and telling me that it was my fault! This guy needs to be fired based on the fact that he kept hanging up on me! And to think that you guys can go in and put notes in place to make it look as if you have done your part when all these validations are bogus!   I then called yet again in hopes of getting a different competent supervisor and I spoke to Markus and he was the only one that tried to help correct the mistake and he clearly stated that the technician missed the appointment and told me he would follow up tomorrow, so now I am taking another day of work and I feel backed into the corner.   I hate the service at COMCAST and I will take the time to share this poor service outcome to all that may make a difference, this is clearly a waste of everybodys time!  I am writing you in hopes that this information can be taken to the top and addressed,Lost a full days work and now the want me here again tomorrow!"
"Anita of Spring, TX",5/13/2008,,"A Comcast sales rep came by my house and offered me a sepcial cable package to upgrade my cable and add digital voice for a total pkg of 65.99usd. Installation was set for Mar 11th but due to installation issues did not happen until mar 19th. My first bill came  3/27-4/26 $209.05.  My second bill 4/27-5/26 $165.84. I refused to pay those bills, requested adjustments, which never happend, was sent to a service center to show them my contract, which I did. They looked at it, made a copy and sent me back to billing, who said that they refer this to special department, takes 2-3business days. Also gave me a phone number of Sales mgr for my area, whom I left several messages with, but never received a call back. My phone is cut of for 3weeks and my cable service is basic, basic cable only. Comcast is telling me they will cut of my service completeley , if I don't pay the $419.99 for the 2 month I had the special ($65.99) package deal.   WHAT A  DEAL , NO ORDEAL THAT IS."
"Richard of Naperville, IL",5/13/2008,,"I have had so many problems with Comcast, it has pretty much been a joke.  But..I have always felt when dealing with them, they were TRYING to remedy the situation until now. A few weeks ago I attempted to record a program with my HD DVR from Comcast. It appeared like it was setup, but when I went to watch the program, I got a message that said this service was disabled.  I called Comcast, spent about an hour and a half on the phone with a very nice customer service rep, who said I basically did not have the DVR service.  I am a NEW customer as of this January 08 and I HAVE USED the DVR service several times to record programming that I would watch at a later date..so I DID HAVE the service. He finally transferred me to a manager who agreed that for some reason it had been disabled.  She confirmed that it WAS part of the Triple Play Package that I originally purchased and YES I should have it.  Said she was transferring me and when I was prompted for the retention department to choose it.  Where ever I was transferred to never had a prompt for the retention department and I am back at the same place I was when I first called.  I explain the situation, but basically start the ENTIRE Process over again..I tell them I have now been on the phone for nearly two+ hours and my patience is getting very short.  The rep tells me she needs to talk to her manager and will call me back shortly.. I am still waiting for that call and it has been 10 Days. Can someone please turn my DVR service back on..Just frustration with Comcast and the loss of many hours of time trying to resolve this issue along with MANY others.."
"Sean of Shreveport, LA",5/13/2008,,"I signed up for the Triple Play approximately 11 months ago.  The service has been spotty, but I've learned to deal with it.  My family and I recently moved and requested a service transfer to our new address.  That is when the real problems started to occur.  First, it took three separate technicians on three separate dates to come out before we finally got service, and even then we only had cable service working--no phone or Internet.  The phone and Internet were eventually fixed days later.  Shortly after, we were out of Internet for a week.  Now, they have sent me a bill for nearly twice what I normally pay, stating that they are billing upfront and for previous service.  Well, through some investigation on my part I found out they don't even have the billing codes right in the first place.  Not only that, but thay haven't credited me for the prior months payment I sent in, which of course they deposited into their Bank of America account.  So, in essence, they are double billing AND overcharging.  The first call I made to straighten their mess out was on April 29, 2008.  I was on the phone with them for over 30 minutes.  Further complicating matters was the fact that the CSR couldn't grasp the basic concepts of elementary math.  So, he said he'd tranfser me to his supervisor.  The supervisor never got on the phone.  The CSR then came back on the line and said the supervisor would have to call me back.  I gave my contact number but never got a call or message.  Wondering whjat happened, I called again and was told the supervisor would be getting with me shortly.  Again, I got no call.  On May 13, 2008 at 9:44 a.m., I called Comcast once again and got a female CSR this time.  I re-told her the dilemma.  After the standard question and answer session, she said she was transferring me to her supervisor--this was at 9:50 a.m.  I was left on hold until 10:05 a.m. when I eventually hung up, effecting a 21-minute phone call that yielded no results.  I immediately called back again at 10:05 a.m.  This time I got a CSR named Al.  I instructed Al to skip all the meaningless chit-chat and patch me through to his supervisor.  He then proceeded to ramble through the standard questions, account verifications, and other stalling techniques.  I told him again to put me through to someone who could actually do something about my situation, preferably someone with a pulse and an IQ above 80.  He told me to hold while he got his supervisor.  He then got back on the line and said the supervisor was unavailable.  He asked for my contact phone number, so this supposed supervisor could call me back.  I gave him the same number as before, ending the conversation at 10:10 a.m.  I still haven't heard from Comcast.I have suffered emotional distress and lost countless hours of my personal time dealing with Comcast's account errors, fraudulent billing techniques, inconsistent service, and general incompetency.  I am also out nearly $200 and have been subjected to a possible service disconnection and credit ding because of my refusal to send them more money, just as they refuse to credit my account with the money I have already sent them (they pre-bill).  Something needs to be done.  In the meantime, I will just switch to satellite and DSL."
"Liliana of North Miami Beach, FL",5/14/2008,,"I was supposed to have my phone and internet installed on 4/26; the tech came and left because he did not have a cable long enough to run the service, he promissed me that he was coming back. I waited for few days, called back and on May 2nd a second tech showed up, after 2 hours of his departure my phone and my internet were dead, called again and they fix it over the phone, worked for 2 days and died again (no phone, no internet), called again, they wanted to set up an appointment for Sunday, May 11 to change the modem because, as per their support,it was bad, I asked them to come on Saturday since Sunday was mother's day, they agreed, they did not showed up on Saturday and did showed up on Sunday, the tech that came did not know that he had to change the modem, he left with out fixing the issue and leaving the modem disasembled. I called again and they tell told me that they were setting up another appointment for Wednesday but no one needed to be at home because the problem was with the outside line. what about the modem that was left in parts. then they agreed that they will be coming back between 11 and 2 to fix everything; I always need to make arrangements to wait for the techs since we all work so we loose working time, this time, my sister is visiting from overseas and has to stay home waiting for them to show up. I am not mentioning the times that I called besides the ones that I was able to talk to one of the so call Customer Service Rep and  the 3 times that I asked to talk to a supervisor and was put on hold because he/she was taking care of a customer (what am I?) and never picked the phone up. Their service is the worse that I ever had. I will not recomend it at all.    I lost hours at work for the appointments, hours on the cell phone talking to Customer Service reps, stress and frustration because they are rude and no one knows what the other one is doing and on top of everything I got a bill from 4/24/ to 5/21 when I never got the service"
"Karen of Folsom, CA",5/16/2008,,"Signal degradation and intermittent signal breaks caused me to have a service call. The technician came out and did not replace my router because he didn't have any with him. He suggested I hard reset my router and if that didn't work buy a new router. I reset it and everything was fine for a weekend and then starting monday morning the signal degradation started again and i was getting kicked off the network as before. I bought and paid to have professionally installed a new router. I experienced the same problem with the signal strength. Comcast's response to this was that they only guarantee a hard wire signal from the modem to a desktop/laptop. They offer no guarantee of service through a router. I spoke to neighbors who noticed the same problems and had service calls as well replacing their modem but continuing to has a slow signal and frequent disconnects. Finally today I signed up for business service for $89.99 per month in the hope that it will restore the signal I used to enjoy until 3 weeks ago.$200 new router, $260 installation, 2 hours online troubleshooting the new router in the event it was the problem. The old router was less than 1 year old. $89 2 year contract for business service. "
"Janice of Bel Air, MD",5/16/2008,,"I signed up for a promotion that Comcast was advertising on television called comcast blast. Which was advertised simply as high speed internet for 6 months at $24.99. However, I am being billed at a rate of $65.99. My service has been spotty, the first month I was without internet for 11 days. I have spoken to numerous customer service representatives who told me that there was no such deal being offered. I found proof of the offer and presented it to them and they still refused to honor it. My husband cancelled the service and returned the equipment and was told that in order to recieve the deal we needed to subscribe to at least basic cable television. When he inquired as to why we were not made aware of this when initially requesting the service the rep. replied everyone knows that its on your contract. We never recieved a contract and had know paperwork stating any such facts. Several days later an independent marketing representative for comcast contacted us and offered us a different deal. Again we singed up but never recieved the deal that was offered. After numerous phone calls and lost time someone finally agreed to honor the commitment. However, when the next bill arrived in the mail it was back to $65.99. "
"Keith of Springfield, MA",5/19/2008,,"Comcast relegated the NFL network to an add-on package. This was not disclosed when we initiated service - it is common knowledge that NFL network is part of regular digital pkgs.  Time and expense of researching, canceling, and re-subscribing w. a more forthright company. General displeasure with their deceit and greed."
"Adam of Southfield, MI",5/21/2008,,"On May 1st, a Comcast technician was scheduled to arrive sometime between 3-7pm at my new apartment I was moving into.  They called and said the technician would be late.  After a difficult conversation as to what should be done, I told them to have the technician call me and tell me when he would be able to make it, or if he wouldnt make it at all.  So the technician or a representative called back around 7pm and said that the technician would not be able to do the installation and asked if I wanted to reschedule.  At that time I was upset that they didnt uphold their end of the deal and I told them I may not reschedule, I had to think about it.  The next day a woman from Comcast called me and stated that if I called her back at her 1-800 number and her extension, that she would do the free installation for me.  I called her on a Sunday and she was not available.  No big deal I thought, Ill just call another representative, its just a internet installation and this type of deal should be pretty common, installation guys Im sure dont make it to all their appointments every time they are scheduled so this free offer must be procedure.  During her message to me, she simply stated that I could call her back, not at what time or whether I needed to speak directly to her to get the deal.  So I called the regular Comcast number and I told the representative that I was offered the free deal and wanted to schedule it.  So they did set up a time, and also guaranteed that I would only pay $29.99 for the next 6 months.  So I thought that was even better.  Then after that, everything went as planned.  The technicians showed up on May 6th and did the installation.  I mentioned to them how it was great that I missed the first guy and these guys were doing it for free.  They simply agreed.  I signed the paper and off they went when the installation was done.  I signed the paper to show that the guys did their work.  There is was no verbal discussion or any written agreement to be held to the charges on the paper I might add.  The paper simply states that the work has been done where the person signs.  Balance due: $0.   I thought it was free, and I have my internet and I can continue on with my life.  But, on May 21st I received the first bill stating I owe $94.79! For sure this must be a mistake.  I know the culprit was the installation charges and it was.  I was mad but felt assured that Comcast would just go ahead and make the changes and fix it.  I called and was transferred 3 times, told my story 3 times and in the end I was being blamed for not having the womans name or number who mentioned the deal.  I told them that the piece of paper and the voicemail was discarded a long time ago; this phone call was made 17 days ago.  I explained to them that this must be a procedure and a refund was in order.  They demanded proof that I was given permission for this free installation and needed to show proof in order to get the refund.  I spoke to a manager but he gave me the runaroundabout 15 times.They said there was nothing they could do, but there were two customer service representatives, and a managers approval to give me the free installation that were involved in the transaction, along with the installers.  But there was no way to trace it and nobody there made note of it.  How convenient for them.   They gave me advice, Make sure you save that name and number next time someone gives you a promotion.   If I call and cancel Im still stuck with a $94.79 bill. I would have never agreed to it if I was going to be charged the installation fee because Im in Detroit now and here we have the most internet service providers in the state here, which means the most competition.  I hold a bachelors from Michigan State University in telecommunications, I should know.  I also work in the telecommunications industry.   For the resolution: I hope someone can make these guys pay, they owe me and other consumers who have been treated the same.  Its less about the money than it is about good business practices and holding businesses accountable when they purposely have systems and policies in place that harm the consumer.Loss of $59.95, one hour defending myself over the phone, telephone minutes I wasted, and of course, frustration."
"Mary of Antioch, CA",5/21/2008,,"Ordered internet and cable service through BuyComcast.com because of $175 in rebates.  After 6 months and multiple phone calls, they now claim that I cancelled that order and reordered directly through Comcast and am not eligible for rebate.  I have an order confirmation number from BuyComcast.com, someone called me, set an appt time and a technician installed the service, the acct is in good standing.  I chose Comcast over satellite because of this rebate offer, now they don't want to honor it.I'm owed the $175 that enticed me to choose Comcast vs a satellite service.  Not to even mention the several hours spent on the phone."
"Corey of Manassas, VA",5/22/2008,,Every month my bill has been wrong.  Then my service went down for a long time about a month.  They had credited me.  During the time my service was down they had 3 technicians come out and try to hook up the modem with no luck and left without any of my service working. Then a fourth supervisor tech came out with no luck.  Finally a month and a half later a guy at comcast fixed it on the phone.  We called comcast to ask what the bill would be with our credit.They said $87.00 we went in and paid.not to go back to the beginning but they were double billing me and admitted to it in 2007 for internet for 7 months.  So then we get a $400 bill saying our service was going to be shut off and there was nothing we could do because we were late since december which is not true.  Everyone I talk to is telling me the same thing but I know it is not true.  They make you feel helpless.  My wife would be the contact call her at the home number she can give you all the info.  Please help.  Mu bill should only be $165 to $175. It has never been right since we signed up with them. I want an attorney to contact me.The result is that I will be out almost $500 for no reason.  Please help

"Jerry of Humble, TX",5/27/2008,,When calling Comcast local they tried to blame it on my browser.
"Lisa of Lebanon, NJ",5/27/2008,,"I have called 6 times and been on hold for up to 30 minutes and they say you must leave a message then they hang up.  I need to speak with them when I have some technical support as I know nothing in addition business is really rough and I cannot shut down during our brief season or tie myself up or my phone lines.  I am so frustrated and of course this is the cable company and I have no recourse. Patriot Media has been our provider for years and we never had a problem and the service was excellent. How do I get them to cooperate, this is my business I need help. They have already shut down my VPN for half a day for them to update, during business hours, this little switch will cost $ 350.00 plus downtime for my business, there is no telling how much business I will lose due to their changeover."
"Lyndsey of Norwich, CT",5/28/2008,,"During the almost eight years that we had Adelphia, we rarely had any problems, except maybe once or twice with bought movies, and even then when we called, they fixed the  problem, apologized and NEVER charged our account more then once for the movie. However as soon as Comcast took over, the problems were non stop. Bought movies would cut out, have audio but no video, video but no audio, bad picture reception, you name it. TV shows had the same thing happen to them. Internet would randomly die, kick us off claiming no service even if it said we had full strength, and sometimes it wouldn't even let us connect. And whenever we called to complain they were extremely unhelpful, ALWAYS charged us twice and technicians rarely were able to help us."
"Ingrid of Fort Myers, FL",5/28/2008,, i called back and let my husband call and spoke to someone in english. they fixed the problem in 5 minutes and it wqs real simple. this is not the first time with them. they hire people that dont know what they are doing. after all of this they only gave me a 5.00 credit on my bill.
"Keith of Oak Park, IL",5/29/2008,,"   Comcast.net has been down - across the entire country for at least 16 hours with no end in site.  A tech told me that a server went down and ""they are rebuilding the site from scratch"". No one who uses Comcast email an access their mail. I'm waiting for an email on a job offer and I use email for 80 percent of my consulting business. This prevents me from working and damages my reputation with clients."
"David of Park Ridge, IL",5/29/2008,,"   Comcast cancelled my service call with out notice. I had to call back 5 times to actually talk to someone. They kept transferring me and disconecting or hanging up. I called on Monday because my wireless router was not working. I called and went thru the name and address thing,reboot the router,reboot the computer with at least 4 different reps. Each time I would finnish doing all this they would transfer me and then disconnect or just plain old disconnect. I finally got someone who seemed to care and after she checked for any outages ect she put in a service ticket. Ticket numberCR125714229. I waited on Thursday and no one called and no one showed up. I have to work for a living, if I have to take off of work no one pays me. I call comcast 5 times on Thursday and they played the same game, transfer and disconnet. I finally got thru to Don signon  number 72899 and he said my service call was cancelled because there was an outage in my area. I told him they checked for any outages on Monday and there were none, an why would they schedule a service call if there was an outage and why didn't anyone call me back to tell me my service call was cancelled? I think comcast makes more promises than it can deliver on and just blows off their customers when they are busy. I am stuck because comcast is the only cable provider in my area. I have no choice but to buy their service. I am sending in a complaint to the Illinois commerce commision and also pettitioning  for a refferendum on the ballot here in Park Ridge to change the cable company that is allowed to do buisness.  I have been with out my E-mail and other internet functions such as banking, job functions ect because of the incompetent employees at comcast and their attitude that since they are the only provider we just have to take it. Well one person can make a difference and individuals have changed the course of history and governments. Comcast your days are numbered.

"Andrew of Commerce City, CO",5/29/2008,,"   I called comcast in Feb-08 to cancell my service because the bill was just outrageous every month. I was told by the representative if I stayed with them and bundled my service they would discount my equipment and charge my $143.00 for a period of 12 months. The next month I called back because my bill was still incorrect, I spoke to another representative who told my the computer was wrong and had not been updated, but don't worry I only owed $50.00 that month. Now we are in May and my bill is still wrong, I called back and was told there was no way my service would cost $143.00 and there was nothing they would or could do about it. I asked to speak to Supervisor, when Sharon got on the line she looked at my account and told me even though her representatives misquoted me, there was nothing she could do and they would not honor the price they gave me. After speaking with her for about fifteen minutes she continued to acknowledge they made a mistake, but would not live up to their end of the bargain. This falls under the idea of Bait-and-Switch. I am disgusted a company would try to use these juvenile tactics to mislead their customers,I will now look into Direct Tv. I have been a customer with comcast for 6 years, and it amazes me they do not care if they lose me as a customer or not.  The financial drain on me to find new service and have it installed is not only due to the service but also to the time needed to research and decide on a new plan. Also my home business will suffer because the email address will have to change as well as the service interruption.

"Mike of Belle Mead, NJ",5/29/2008,,Comcast just took over from my old cable company Patriot Media.  All I can say is how disappointed I am with the Comcast way of doing business.  It took over an hour to pay a bill.  I give them a very bad rating.  Too bad I cannot get Fiber in my area.  The most disappointing thing is they just dont care.I want my hour of time back.
"Jeffrey of Highland, MI",5/30/2008,,"I called on 5/30/08 to complain about overages, not returning calls, not responding to certified letters, I have never dealt with such poor customer service. I was on hold for 44 minutes finally had to call with another phone so someone could here I was still on hold aske to speak with a supervisor about my bill. I told my story then was told they were in tech service and could not help me. I am tired of poor service over billing not keeping scheduled service appopintments etc."
"Alissa of New Providence, NJ",6/1/2008,,"I am so fed up with Comcast. We recently moved to a new house about 2 months ago. Our initial installation was a nightmare. The technincian installed the cable wire through the shower! They had to come back 3 more times to fix the cable, phones and internet. The last 2 bills I have received have been wrong and have taken me over an hour on the phone to straighten out. And they still weren't fixed! Not to mention, our phone didn't work the first 15 days. And when they finally came back to fix it, they unplugged our alarm system that was connected to the phone line. Consequently, our alarm company had to come back, charge us $100 to reconnect and Comcast will not reimburse us. On our last bill, we were charged again for Comcast coming back to fix the internet that never worked in the first place! Is this a joke? Horrible service!"
"Debbie of Wellington, FL",6/2/2008,,"   I am charged for movies we did not order. Comcast customer service operator told me on the phone that the movies were ordered with the remote control and that we had to have ordered them.  When I ask how come there was an event ordered on one tv but it showed it was on the box that we are having problems with? The rep said they couldn't answer that. My bill is $700. Comcast gave us a box without model or serial numbers on it and this is the same box where all these movies were ordered.  I have requested my past bills because I have been paying the bill with out an invoice, it has been about 3 weeks still no past bills."
"Dale of Frederick, MD",6/2/2008,,"   We bought a new house in frederick, MD.  I understand it would take a little while for comcast to come out and hook up cable.  April 24 , 2008 contacted a general contractor for COMCAST ( a joke)he stated that he would be able to come out and hook me up real soon.  Never happended if fact will not call back and stated that it would probably take about 2 months to get hooked up.  APRIL 28, 2008 had a ticket or der since then and have been promised many time s to be contacted by supervisers but never have.  I have school and need internet to complete school.  I am very frustrated with the lie's and the promises.  I have tried direct TV but they cannot hook me up because of the way the house sits and where the grounding wire is.  So I have no choice but to go with COMCAST.  This really makes me upset."
"Patricia of Fort Gratiot, MI",6/2/2008,," My husband and I ordered the triple play package deal. Every thing was fine for two months, then for no reason we were disconnected from our service. We had to go to a pay phone and sit for an hour on three seperate occasions. We were lied to repeatedly about why we were shut off. One person actually told us that we called and told them to shut us off. Finally someone told us the truth. They made a mistake and shut us off for no reason, during which time they gave our phone number to someone else. We went for a week without service. Then finally a technician came and turned us back on. They told us we would not be charged for the reconnect fees or for the time we went without service. I was already mad and wanted to change services then so I called them and they reassured me that we would not be charged for those items. They told me I had been credited and at that time I owed them nothing, and that my next bill would be credited more and I would only have to pay $70.00. The very next day I recieved a bill for $38.00 that was behind and in danger of shut off. At this point I was tired of talking to them, so I decided to wait a couple of days before I called back again to complain TO my shock and horror, merely three days later, We received another bill. A bill for $264.79. we were in danger of being shut off. I looked at the bills (my previous two as well). I noticed that we were charged for the month of may three times. Also we were double charged for the voice on the last two bills. Also, not only did they charge us the re-connect fees, they charged us for new lines, technical supports.... totaling $158.00!!!!! Needless to say, all the technician did was flip a switch outside to turn us back on, none of these other services were done. I can not believe this. We got on the phone. This time they were very rude, and said that basically i didn't understand the bills correctly and we were not overcharged and we signed for the tech when he came out, so we can't prove that he didn't do all the stuff it said on the bill he did. So I asked him then, how did I go from owing nothing to oweing $38.00 the next day, then three days later over $250? How do these people stay in business? Isn't there any thing we can do? "
"Richard of Houston, TX",6/2/2008,,They scheduled three appointments in the same week to repair my cable reception and failed to show up for any of the three appointments.I do not have use of my cable tv
"Gwendolyn of Glen Campbell, PA",6/3/2008,,"About 18 mos ago we bought a HD television so that we could get a brighter clearer TV as my husband has failing eyesight.  We were told by Comcast that HD would come by Feb 2009.  Indeed it has come even sooner Jume 2008) and though it was advertised as being in our area it is NOT coming here.  It is NOT coming here ever. No one at Comcast can tell us why and we spent gobs of money for the TV set up for HD TV.  We are so angry because we have no other options to get HD for our TV.       The other aspect about Comcast is that their technical support and customer service is so bad we frequently have to spend half a day just to find out something as simple as You have no email because hackers got into our servers.  Then when the servers are fixed in some kind of ritualistic rotation, it finally gets to us 3 days after it gets to a town (Indiana, PA) 30 miles down the road.        The damage may be great as my husband was planning to use the TV as a very large screen for his writing. The other damage is psychological...Comcast clearly sees us living in a poor area and will not fund what is necessary to get HD up here yet we have a commerical account for a stable ISP address because of my work."
"Vickie of Shreveport, LA",6/4/2008,,"I have been a customer of Time Warner/Comcast since 1988.  I have moved 3 times during Time Warner's reign in Shreveport and never had a minutes trouble.  On April 5, 2008 I moved from a house into an apartment complex.  I scheduled Comcast to come out on April 5th to hook up my service in my apartment (Digital Cable and High Speed Internet).  They sent a contractor who looked at my outlet and informed me that I was not getting a signal and he didn't know why so they would have to send out a Comcast Technician on Monday, April 7th.  I took the day off from work because they were supposed to be there between 8 and 5.  No one ever showed or called.  So I called them around 6 p.m. and was told they would have to send someone out on Wednesday, April 9th.  I took another day off from work just to be told that they would have to get into the apartment above me and the tenant was not home so they would have to reschedule.  They came out again on that Saturday, April 12th and still when they left I had no cable service.  Finally on Saturday, April 18th I got my outlet in my living room fixed so that I had my digital cable service.  They would have to come back to install my outlet for my high speed internet.  I waited to be contacted about my outlet and no one ever called.  Around the end of May I sent a complaint e-mail in on the Comcast website and someone contacted me to come out and look at installing my outlet.  The gentleman came out and said he would have to get in touch with the apartment complex and his supervisor to see how they were going to handle it.  He would call me the following day.  I'm not sure the dates here but I know it was the end of May.  He never called, so I again went to the Comcast website and sent another e-mail to customer service.  He called me 2 days later to inform me that his supervisor said they would not be installing my outlet for me.  I have been billed for internet service during all this time.  I have called customer service only to be told that I would have to pay the bill and then they would adjust it.  I have phoned the contact person that the apartment complex gave me his name is Lavell.  He was supposed to come out yesterday, June 3rd and see what he could do to get my outlet installed, but he never showed.  I have never dealt with a more unorganized group of people than what I have dealt with over the last couple of months with Comcast.  Where do I turn now?  They are still billing me for internet service and everytime I try to call to have my internet service disconnected they schedule an appointment to send someone else out.  Today I tried to login to my account online so I could send another complaint e-mail to them and they have shut-down my online access.  I can't check my e-mail, complain to them or anything.  Is there anyone who regulates these cable companies and how they treat their customers or do we have to just deal with it because they are the only show in town?  I know I don't have all the dates down that I missed work and I probably have left out some of the dates that they were at my apartment but I missed a total of fives days of work over this ordeal.Five missed days of work.  I don't want anything out of Comcast except for them to fix my outlet so I can have my high speed internet service and for them to adjust my bill for the time that I was out of service.  I currently have a $300 bill from Comcast and haven't had full service except my digital cable service from April 18th to today and my bill was paid in full when I moved."
"Janet of Falmouth, MA",6/4/2008,,"I live in a senior complex.  When Adelphia Cable was the main cable company, the seniors received a reasonable discount.  $10. for Basic and $15. for Standard.  Now with Comcast in, (with no competitors) we are at their mercy.  Seniors are paying the going prices.  But yet, another senior complex in the same town is being charged the discounts as described above. The seniors are on a fixed income, living in the State of Massachusetts with extremely high costs of living.  I call this discrimination. For $14.95, the seniors can get Basic cable, which consists mostly of home shopping channels, spanish speaking channels and local stuff.  The other senior complex is not even 1/2 mile from this one.  Comcast is a multi-million dollar outfit, but yet they are closing their eyes to being consistent with the seniors here in this town.  The mental anguish is enough!"
"Candace of Chicago, IL",6/5/2008,,"This company set up an scheduled appointment for me on 6-4-08 The tech was a no show. When I called I was told they would have the tech call me and he did to say sorry he wasnt given the equipment to do the job by his supervisor so he couldnt come!  That led to many more calls to Comcast and being put on hold repeatedly, being disconnected, and being given very inaccurate information about exactly when someone would be out. They then rescheduled a tech and didn't let us know by coutesy of a phone call or anything. I had to pay someone 30.00 to sit at the home waiting. Yesterday 170.00 was lost from work to stay home and wait. This doesn't include airtime charges incurred by being put on hold so much over the course of 2 days.They kept either disconnecting me today and giving me incorrect information regarding times and I don't know how this company is still is business. A class action lawsuit should be filed for all the monies lost by people being  left hanging waiting for no show techs and the customer service people lying to the consumers.monies lost from work to stay home and wait for installation, airtime charges being put on hold for long periods of time. having to pay people to saty at the home and wait so you dont miss anymore work."
"Stephen of Harrisonburg, VA",6/5/2008,,Our Internet cable connection starts arcing every time there is a thunderstorm in the area. Blue and white sparks jumping on the cables. Called Comcast and they said it was a problem for an electrician as they ensure their cables are grounded. Our cable box coming into the house is not grounded. The Directv and phone box both have grounds (physical grounds). Comcast says it is not their fault.Got the heck shocked out of me when I touched the Internet cable coming into the house!
"R. of Grand Rapids, MI",6/7/2008,,"The Comcast 768K service absolutely tops out at 90K.  Period.  That's it. They intentionally limit speed to 90K, even though they advertise it as high speed.   My old ATT 768K DSL would go as high as 450K+ if the server had the capability.  Unable to continue at this pathetic speed and will have to pay AT&T over $200.00 installation to restore my DSL service."
"Jennifer of Round Lake, IL",6/8/2008,,"Starting in the beginning of May 2008 my husband and I got divorced. We moved into a new house and the first thing we did was call comcast. They came out the first week of May and installed our tv and internet services. The gentleman was very nice and said we just needed to contact customer service to have the three email accounts on my ex husbands transferred over to our new account. Easy enough- that's what I thought. I contacted customer service right away and the Rep put in a ticket to have this completed. I called back a few days later to check and make sure it was completed and was told the ticket had been closed and the tech did not see any problems with us accessing our emails and they were working fine. I advised them that this was not the issue the ticket should have been opened for and that we we're just trying to transfer over our emails- we were not having any problem accessing them at all. The rep then put in a new ticket and told me it would now be entered correctly and completed within 48 hours. At this time customer service also contacted my ex husband to make sure his permission was granted for this to take place. On May 12th I called back to see what the status of the claim was. I was given some tired excuse and told that they would make it a priority so that it would be complete within 24 hours. I told them I would like a call back when this was completed to avoid any further time of mine wasted calling back in. On May 17th I still had not heard anything regarding the ticket and transfer of our email accounts and once again phoned comcast. This time I was told it was still pening and someone would be calling me on Monday. I never did receive this call and had to phone back in again on May 25th. This time I spoke with a Supervisor named Veronica/Ronnie. She looked into the issue a bit further and said the reason this was taking so long and still pending was because comcast had not received permission from my ex husband (which they already had at the beginning of the month). Rather than spend anymore time on the phone I said I would call him and have him call in to give his permission again. Ronnie said as soon as they spoke with him the issue would be taken care of within a few hours. My ex husband called and gave his permission. Later that day I still did not hear anything from Ronnie and called back. I was told she had left for the day and as far as this supervisor new it would take 24-48 hours to be completed now.I waited another week. On June 1st I had still not heard anything and called back. This time I spoke with a supervisor named James. After going over the problem for what seemed to be the thousandth time he said the reason nothing was being completed on this ticket now was because last weekend when they finally spoke with and got permission from my ex husband that the rep simply forgot to resubmit the ticket! He resubmitted the ticket and assured me this time that it had all the correct information, everyone's approval, and that it would be complete in 24-72 hours. He also reassured me and noted on the account again for whomever that completes this calls me to let me know it has been complete. Now here I am, it is June 8th. I still had not received a phone call and once again had to take time out of my day to call comcast. Today I spoke with a Sup named Greg. He advised me that this ticket is still waiting to be assigned for a tier 2 rep to complete. I told him that I thought it was an eslcated/emergeny flagged ticket and was to be completed immediately according to the past Supervisors. He confirmed this but could not give me any reason to why it has been 8 days and still it has not been assigned nor completed. He could not give me any time frame as to how long it will take for someone to get assigned to this or how much longer my ticket will have to be out in limbo. It doesn't seem to me that in any customer service enviorment that an eslcated issue should take 8 days or more to get resolved. I wouldn't have minded waiting the 8 days in the beginning, but considering we have already been dealing with this for the past month it seems a little rediculus that this cannot be made a priority. Everyone at comcast seems very good about putting the blame on the person who handled the situation before them and giving excuses, but no one seems able to do anything to fix the situation.

"Cynthia of Lees Summit, MO",6/8/2008,,"Have been without cable TV for over 3 weeks now.  Have a few channels here and there but nothing we can watch with any consistency.  We have called many times starting 3 weeks ago.  We were originally told someone would be out on May 27.  Then no one showed up and we called again.  We were told we just didn't understand, they would not be coming until June 2.  The night of June 2 we called to find out what they were going to do to fix our cable.  They said they would not be out until the next day.  The next evening we called and got the same story.  Pretty much been the story since.  This week they did agree to give us a $100 credit on our bill, although our bill is $150 a month.  For the past 3 days I have been told that someone would be contacting the Maintenance dept and call me right back.  I have not had one call.  Sometimes I am on hold for over 45 min.  We have no television service and have been charged, lied to and have missed 3 days of work staying home waiting on service that never shows up."
"Kristina of Wheeling, WV",6/10/2008,,   I have asked this company repeatedly to stop soliciting my home address. They have ignored my requests and continue to send internet/cable/phone offers to my home.  They will not stop sending solicitations to my residence though I have asked them to stop immediately.
"Sonia of Stone Mountain, GA",6/10/2008,,"   On 6/6/08 I receive basic cable service with comcast. Before the tech AJ came out to connect my service i ask,how much my bill would be? he responded it cost me $25.00 to come out & connect & a monthly service charge on $24.95 for basic cable. After he left and i notice the order form, he did not check the box that shows how much my montly payment is or the service i should be receiving. I then call him and he said to me he was on the phone and he will call me back when he was through, I waited but he never called back, so I check the internet for comcast and got phone#. I called and got rep. Lemeka so i told her what happen and that i wanted to know exactly how much is my montly service charge becuase it only show $24.95 for 3montly. She started by saying there is a $50.00 credit fee,$29.00 connection and my bill will be $52 plus tax & other charges, I then ask to speak with a supervisor because I was never about these charges.The only charges i am aware of was that I needed to pay $25.00 which i did when the tech came out and my montly service for basic cable is $24.95. Lemeka the rep. said her supervisor Linda G was on a conference call & so I left a message on her vmail to call me asap. I then check the website & sent an email to Rick G (SVP Customer Operation Comcast). I then call back spoke with rep. Johanna was told a diferent story, I call the third time & spoke with rep Pam. I just was to know exactly how much my montly chages for basic cable & not a set of added and unnecessary charges.I called and got rep.

"Nathalie of Belleville, NJ",6/10/2008,,"   Since I signed up with Comcast 3 years ago. I have never been able to recieve all the channels I should be getting. It started with having to have 3 service people out the first day to install the digital box and internet. They left and it still was not working. It took a week for them to finally get it up and running. Only to break down again a week later. They have had the cable to the apartment replaced, They have replaced my converter box several times. When the system goes down it takes a week for them to come out and fix it but I have never recieved any credit. I am tired of paying for service I do not get. I live in an apartment and I am not allowed to have Direct tv installed.There has to be a way to stop this monopoly from doing what it is doing. Previous to this I actually moved out of comcasts area just to get away from them. Due to pressures of the commute I had to move back into there area. I have complained to the local ombudsman but they just gave the complaint to comcast and they did nothing about it. I hate this countries love of law suits but the more I deal with this company I can see that someone needs to put this company out of businessPrevious to this I actually moved out of comcasts area just to get away from them.

"George of Citrus Heights, CA",6/11/2008,,my hi speed internet from cast is getting slower and slower.  Just like my old dial up days! What can be done? 
"Julie of Houston, TX",6/12/2008,,"Comcast supplies our internet and cable television services. Our internet failed last night and we were promised they would arrive first thing this morning to fix it. When I called to confirm our appointment, they told me the tech would arrive in 45 minutes. It is now the evening and we have yet to see or hear from any technicians. I have been on the phone with Comcast all day, seriously, every 30 minutes I have called them and spoken with different people each time. They have assured me that Dispatch would be contacting me, but they didn't. They have assured me they have escalated my ticket. Unlikely. Each and every time we have called for service with Comcast, not just today, the technicians have cancelled our tickets claiming they arrived at my home and received no answer. I have been home each and every time there has been an appointment. We are in a situation where we cannot change cable/internet companies because Time Warner sold out to Comcast in our area. If we switch we will be out extra cash each month. And the speed cannot be equalled. We work from home and when our internet goes down, we lose money, both on a personal and a corporate level.  We get internet on our phones, but our clients will not accept having to wait for our responses."
"Faith of Little Rock, AR",6/12/2008,,"Canceled services because none of our promotional deals would transfer when we moved to another street in the same local area.  Took equipment to their location on Monday.  Guy at counter was extremely rude and behaved as if taking back Comcast's equipment was a huge imposition.  Called on Thursday to verify disconnect of service and they claim no proof of equipment turned in.  Receipt was buried in move, so called twice to request number to contact local office directly.  Once they hung up on me and another time told me there is no way to call them directly - I must drive out to the location.  Receipt was finally located, so I called again to give them the information.  First time, I was put on hold before she even asked my account number and the person never came back to the phone.  Hung up and called again and they tell me I still have to drive to the local office because they cannot verify my receipt over the phone.  Spent my entire lunch hour and the $4 per gallon gas to drive there.  They say it is now turned off, but I cannot call the 1-800 number to verify because they apparently all went to lunch and no one will answer the phones.I am filing this complaint in the hopes that others will see it and choose not to use Comcast.  If they are already involved, I hope they will read this and know to be absolutely certain that Comcast registers the return of equipment.  I would recommend calling the 1-800 number from their parking lot to ensure it is off before leaving the local office."
"Maxine of Cheltenham, PA",6/12/2008,,"Comcast has been down for the last 3 days. They want to blame it on the storm since it just happened yesterday. The worst thing about getting the 3 in 1 is that when one thing goes, it ALL goes. Even worst is you won't know you don't have telephone service unless you have a cell & someone contacts you on that and tells you your phone is not on. Comcast also has not hired staff to handle all these new accounts they are advertising for. So you are left waiting 5-6 days for someone to come out. I going back to  Verizon for phone service. Comcast should stick to cable and perfect that service. Too many companies trying to do things they know nothing about. Lastly, I want 3 days credit for no service' I'm calling about that now.You are left without phone, internet or tv; and if you have elderly people or young children it presents a very dangerous situation."
"Judith of Queeche, VT",6/16/2008,,"My girlfriend has been refused contact with customer service supervisors.  Her service was disconnected accidentally by a COMCAST service person.  She called and a representative restarted her service, however, her high speed internet was not connected as well as she was charged as if she was being connected for the first time.  Everytime she calls now, she is put on hold and then disconnected and refused service.  As I am a comcast customer as well, I think it is totally unacceptable that she was refused contact with a supervisor. She cares for a woman and it puts strain on her schedule to take days off waiting for a comcast technician that doesn't show up - as was the case today(6/12/2008).  also takes classes online and not having internet access is affecting her class performance.  9-year old son has a brain disease called Chiari Malformation and utilizes the internet to feverishly research the disease and any experts that may be available to help in the treatment of her son.   Bottom line, I would like Rick Germano - SVP COMCAST customer support, to contact personally and please re-assure her that this issue will be resolved and the process of rectifying her service and faith that her voice as a COMCAST customer will be heard.   I would like to know if there is any legal recourse she can take to offsett her loss of pay as a result of waiting for a comcast service representative who does not show up to rectify her service."

"Dileep of East Windsor, NJ",6/16/2008,,"I signed with Comcast in October/November 2007 with one year contract for Cable and internet services. When I called in early April to set my account for auto pay, I confirmed with the representative if I was still on the one year contract. The representative was nice to confirm. In late May/early June, I received the higher bill (more than double), when inquired, the customer representative told that his supervisor was not there and he will call me after few hours. After waiting three days, I called again but the customer service representative transferred me to different department and I spoke with Kim. According to Kim, he doesn't know; why my promotion was discontinued but he will call me after checking/looking into this. After waiting another few days, I called again and spoke with Susan; who promised me to call back but as of today, I have not heard anything and when I am trying to talk about this with any representative, they just transfer my call from one to another department. I would appreciate, if you please help me in resoloving this issue. There will be  economic damage if they will not give me promotion at this time since I missed other deals and I do call almost every other day which will be bad for my job/work production."
"Laura of Gloucester, MA",6/16/2008,,"I called comcast to set up cable after finding an authorized comcast dealer web site offering cable for 39.95 month with $75 cash back. Promo code 9299.  After talking to a rep for 30 minutes she went to this web site -- comcast's own website -- and said, Oh that's not offered in your area and tried to sell me the same service for 89.95 a month. This is outrageous. There is no choice. You cannot choose which channels you want.  They are a monopoly in our area and the prices just keep going up.  Where's the competition?  Why do they have the right to do this?  I've written to my senators but have heard nothing about regulating the cable companies."
"John of Cranford, NJ",6/17/2008,,I have been without phone service for 5 days and they failed to show up for am appointment.  I have three small children so this is not acceptable.  Please help me as they locked me into a contract and provide poor service and keep raising the costs each couple of months.  This is not fair!I cannot call 911 as I do not have phone service!
"John of Miami, FL",6/18/2008,,"Comcast is the worst of the worst.  Our house is quite large so we need two connections to get all the TVs.  One line was sitting 1 inch below the ground and when the big truks came to pick up the leaf piles twice a year, this cable is invaribly damaged.  It is often two or three visits just to get them to fix it.  We asked them to bury it and they said OK but the ground team has to come.  After 2 calls the ground team came and buried the cable aboout 1 and 1/2 inches at best and it took all day.  We complained 4 times until they came back and reburied it about 1 and 3/4 inches.  You could kick the dirt and expose the cable.  The next time the leaf trucks came, no service for half the house again.  I asked them if they could run a cable in the attic to connect the other part of the house to the good cable.  They said they don't do that.  I asked who does and they said they did not know.  This was two years ago.  They are so frightfully inept and confused that I have given up.  I can no longer stomach comversation with these people who could obviously not care less.  When they call me with promotions for phone and internet, I just laugh and say no thank you. The only damage is to their reputation which apparently is so bad that my problem matters not at all."
"Amit of Washington, DC",6/19/2008,,"It has been 7 days that I am trying to get the service installed. It was scheduled on tuesday between 2:00 PM and 5:00 PM and the technician called me at 12:00 and told me that if I want to get service installed, I need to get home now. He was extremely rude and used profain words.  Thursday, I scheduled installation between 5:00 and 8:00. The technicial called at 1:00 and wanted to find out if I can get the installation done than. I requested to keep appointment for scheduled time and he agreed. The supervisor called me at 5:40 that the technician is on the way, no one showed up till 7:00pm, I ran to grocery store at 7:00 and recieved a call at 7:05 that a technician is waiting on my door, requested a 5 min wait but when I got back no one was there. This is extremely rediculous. Comcast treats its customers very bad. I am looking for other options in the area."

Maximum that I ever had with the Comcast it 2990 Kb - Download speed. 880 Kb Upload speed. I should have 1100 Kb Technician visited my house few times but problem never was fixed. My TV service have problem too. Picture on TV has snow or lines.  I'm looking for another providers.  How much cost stress, frustration, feeling of have been cheated? How much time lost? How many sleepless nights to finish my work because  that slow speed? How much business not done? When I see their commercial on TV I become sick in my stomach."
"William of Oak Park, IL",6/22/2008,,"I am a network engineer by trade. In my locality Comcast is the predomonant carrier for cable television and broadband. On the television reception side of things the amount of compression they apply to video signals is really beginning to show up on almost all non-HD channels as blockiness. On HD channels, there are often interruptions in the audio portion.  Broadband is much worse. I see average ping times to my default route of 500ms, Domain Name Servers (DNS) that are unreachable, connection resets when trying to retrieve emails or download Windows updates. Throughput, on the rare occasion when things are working may approach 4 Mbps (which is what they advertise), but is typically hovering around a sputtering, intermittent 300 Kbps. In my opinion, this level of service does not constitute broadband.  Repeated calls yield little to no results other than the suggestion that I unplug my cable modem and reconnect it. When I get more insistent about problem solving, then they tell me that they will need to send a technician to my premises to check my connections. I ask them how this will help my Comcast afflicted neighbors who are all experiencing the same problems. At this point they tell me that I should talk to a higher level support technician, and after being on hold for ten minutes all I receive is a click and a dial tone. Repeating this process yields similar results. It is futile.Comcast is expensive at approximately $150.00 per month for a TV and internet package."
"Stephen of Philadelphia, PA",6/22/2008,,"I have have trouble with my High Definition cable service for five months.  I have been given every excuse in the Comcast playbook.  Trouble in the area. We are wroking on it.  You have a bad box.  I have already switched boxes twice.  No improvement.  We will snd a service technician.  Two appointments and two no shows.  The last service technician had the audacity to actually file a report that he was at my home and the problem was resolved.  I waited four hours for him and he never showed and never called.  I have been given credits on my account for lcak of service.  I don't want credits, I want what I am paying for.I run a large business in Philadelphia.  I have lost 8 hours of time waiting fro Comcast and has spent untold hours on the telephone on hold listening to their sales pitches and becoming more infuriated by the minute."
"Glenn of Cumming, GA",6/23/2008,,Internet service cutoff and was told 2 different excuses. One was I was downloading a lot which they never mentioned that when I signed up. Second now is bandwidth which I have no control over. Back to DSL if nothing can be done with Comcast with to much power and control! 
"James of Wheaton, IL",6/23/2008,,"I pay $190 per month for combined TV, Phone and Internet. For the past week, every single morning, our phone and cable has gone out for 2 to 6 hours. Customer service are polite, but tell me to reset the modem or some other stupid thing. When I tell them others in the neighborhood are having the same problem with Comcast, they deny they have an area related problem.  Actually, they have no way of knowing that unless a sufficient number of complaints are received.  I suspect (based on trucks in the area), they are installing new customers and don't give a damn about people who already subscribe."
"Victoria of Chattanooga, TN",6/23/2008,,"   I moved into a complex from my old address i dealt with a man named chris at mountain brrok apts ..

"Martha of Plainsboro, NJ",6/24/2008,,"On June 2, I went to Comcast's webpage to pay my bill.  When I submptted my information, the response came back as unable to process this request, please try again.  Instead of trying again, I called the automated line to try it that way, and I received the same message.  When I called and finally reached one of the live dummies (Kay) I was told that I had not submitted any payment.  Before we hung up I asked her to check again and she said oh, wait a minute, I do see that you submitted payment.  I asked whether it was submitted twice or once and she insisted that it was only once.  Lo and behold, I checked my account and I am now debited twice the amount I paid.  I immediately called them back and spoke with dummy #2 (Tiffany) who advises that she is going to fix the problem by submitting a claim for on my behalf, and will call me tomorrow for an update.  Tiffany never calls so I get the next one (Janice) who said that Tiffany didn't completely fill out the claim form and that she would now correct Tiffany's errors.  Janice also sent an email to Evelyn in billing.  I asked Janice to copy me on the email, which she politely did.  Well, Evelyn never called or responded, even after I wrote Evelyn directly.  I then called again every day after that and spoke with several different people, the latest of whom was Patricia who said that this was not good customer service and that she didn't blame me for being angry and on the verge of suing.  She then proceeded to promise to call me back on Saturday and even gave me a time.  Now Patricia is in Louisiana (even though I'm dialing a 609 area code) and makes a posture of confirming the time difference and setting the time that she will be returning the call to me with an update.  She even went so far as to say that she is sending the request to two manager who really get things done, Chris and somebody else.  Do you think I received that call?"
"Vivian of Houston, TX",6/24/2008,,   I have had comcast for a couple of years now. My sevrice is out every other month. Which doesnt make sense. I called to let you know and it takes an hour to get threw. I have elderly parents and small children that needs a phone incase something happens. You guys are quick to cut your severice off but take your time to send someone out. Never once have I gotten a call back when I left a messgage with a manager.  
"Patty of Boca Raton, FL",6/24/2008,,"I called to have an HD box installed in the bedroom, when the technician arrived looking like a gangster he had no idea why he was there. The tech had no idea how to hook it up. He called customer service and they could not help him. In the mean time all my T.V's went off and no one knew why they went out or how to get them working again. I had to schedule another appointment which was was 4 days later. I have a bulk where I live so I have no choice for my cable provider. Comcast started charging for service calls for bulk customers with the understanding that if it was a problem with the equiptment the customer would not be charged, that is a joke because they will always say the equiptment was fineit was the customers TV.

"Milton of Byram, MS",6/26/2008,,   I had road runner online service for years one year ago I wrote a letter of complaint about there prices and service well I just canceled it and they want 19.95 to pick there modem that they deliveried to my home when i bought service now the get all the dollar company is so cheap that they can not even pick up there equipment unless they get paid for it I personally hope DIRECTV and Att bury your high prices and put you on the street corner with a sign that reads used to be cable company exe. but now i need your money so i can eat.
"Forrest of Willingboro, NJ",6/26/2008,,"Had Comcast install internet, phone and cable tv in a bundled pkg on 2/20/08, after filling out a form, and was promised a $100 gift certificate after it was installed (and paid for 90 days).  Then I am supposed to wait 4-6 weeks after the 90 days have passed.  I should have the gift card in my hand now. When I call, they say this is handled out of North Brunswick, NJ and they do not have the number there.  They cannot give me a person in Management to resolve this.  They do not care about valid customer complaints/inquiries.I need the money now and I do not want to devote any more of my time to their problem."
"Jackie of Fort Myers, FL",6/26/2008,,"When is someone going to force Comcast to provide the service they charge so dearly for?  Because my husband is unable to work due to an injury, he has been trading stocks on line in an attempt to bring some income into our home.  Our Comcast internet service cuts out at least 10 - 15 times per day, often resulting in financial loss because our ability to receive streaming market information is interrupted.  When this first began to happen, almost immediately upon initiating our subscription for streaming stock info, we notified Comcast who checked our service remotely and declared it to be in excellent shape.  Problem continued so we purchased a new computer thinking maybe that was the problem.  Problem continued so we had our software vendor and brokerage account check for problems on their end.  No one else was experiencing any problem so we again called Comcast who again checked things out remotely and discovered that just maybe there was a problem.  Sent out a technician who found things to be working perfectly.  Problem persists - check things remotely again and find that the signal coming into our home is off the charts powerful.  Send out a second technician who puts some kind of reducer on the back of our modem and says that should cut down the signal and solve our whole problem.  Problem continues.  Check things remotely, admit there could be a problem, send out a third technician.  Third technician finds our signal to be +17 when it should be between -5 and +5 with zero being optimum.  We are too close to the tap and the signal is way to strong.  There is discoloration on the back connections of the modem resembling burn marks which were discussed with the tech.  Modem was replaced which brought the signal down to +12 which he feels should take care of things.  My husband astutely pointed out that we were still +7 above acceptable levels and the tech responded that it was too bad WE didn't have a spare roll of cable because he could splice it in to increase the distance the signal had to travel before coming into the back of the computer which would further weaken the signal.  He left after declaring the situation fixed.  Next day, internet goes down at least eight times.  I called Comcast AGAIN and this time when she checks things remotely, she says things have been working perfectly since the modem was replaced and she can not detect that it ever went down.  I just about hit the roof.  Now she said Comcast will send out a line crew because it sounds like we may have a problem in the line which has never been checked before.  And oh, by the way, she issued a $4.00 credit for all our trouble.We will never know the actual amount of our damages.  Not only could we have seen stocks going up but we could have quickly sold those that were going down.  In this highly volatile market, things change in a matter of seconds.  Precious time was lost when we had to log back on to the internedt, our brokerage account, our trading software, and our live feed."
"Mary of Rockville, MD",6/26/2008,,"We signed up for Comcast Triple Play in February, 2008. It was our understanding that our costs would not exceed $99.00/month. Since that time our cost has  been between $191.00 and $229.00 per month. The other problem is that the phone works only part of the time. There is often static, echos, 3rd party conversations and times where the other party cannot hear you. Comcast has come out on numerous occasions but has not been able to correct the problem. Every time we call about the bill, we are put on hold for 1-2 hours and they are not able to answer our questions. We also were told when we signed up that we would receive a $300.00 rebate which we never received. When I called today, I was told that they have no record that I filled out any application for the rebate even though I gave them the tracking number I received when I filled out the form online. The tracking number is 16957258. We are at our wits end and are thinking of cancelling Comcast but were told there would be a $150.00 fee for cancelling. We should be given a refund for the phone part of our service, the rebate promised and no cancellation fee in my opinion.My husband works out of the house and often his clients cannot hear him. His clients have told him how frustrated they are when they call and there is nothing on the other end. With all the problems we have had, I'm sure some of his clients have opted for an agent they can reach."
"Deborah of East Brunswick, NJ",6/26/2008,,"I have 2 laptops connected wirelessly to a Comcast modem for internet service.  Hereinafter referred to as Modem 1  On or about 6/23/08, a Comcast Technician came into my home and installed a second modem to connect directly to a third computer in the home.  Hereinafter referred to as Modem 2  On 6/24/08, while Modem 1 was functioning, neither laptop was able to access the internet.  After an approximate 2.5 hour conversation with Comcast IT employees, Modem 1 was provisioned and access was restored. Provisioning of Modem 1 was at approx. 11:00 pm.  On 6/25/08 at approx. 7:15 am, Modem 1 was still working.  On 6/25/08 at approx. 8:00 pm, Modem 1 again would not permit access to the internet by either laptop.  Additionally, Modem 2 was not permitting access for the entire day.  During the day on 6/25/08, a representative of Comcast advised that Comcast always has problems with more than one modem installed in a household due to their computer system.   After approximate 3 hours on the phone with Cecil and Eric of Comcast during the evening of 6/25/08, neither modem could be effectively provisioned.    As of 6/26/08, I still have no connection to the internet, with an appointment for a representative to come out on 6/27/08 between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., for which I will be missing time from work.  In addition, during telephone conversations on 6/24 and 6/25 with representatives of Comcast, I was mistransferred a minimum of 4 separate occasions during each phone call thereby placing my call back into queue, Hello and thank you for calling Comast. Press 1 for English...  I then had to repeat myself from the beginning for each separate representative.  Comcast knowingly, maliciously and frauduently sold a contract for an additional modem knowing full well that Comcast would be unable to provide service for both modems as was so confirmed.  Additionally, by the adding of the second modem, existing internet service ceased to function completely.  Over five hours on the phone with representatives during the course of two evenings proved absolutely fruitless.  I am losing time and money with no connection to the internet.  I maintain an online business where response time is of the essence.  I am unable to respond to potential customers and existing clients thereby causing me great detriment."
"Carol of Bloomington, MN",6/26/2008,,"For several months, our cable tv service has been marred by very bad interference in the reception, where the picture and often the sound will freeze. This occurs intermittenly, with no discernable pattern, but it occurs on a daily basis, and often it is so bad that it renders the tv virtually unwatchable. Attempts to have this problem fixed have not been met. One technician claimed this was a normal thing, which is simply not true as it only began happening a few months ago. In other cases they claimed to not know what could be causing it."
"Rick of High Bridge, NJ",6/27/2008,,"I contacted Comcast for a quotation on their internet service.  After dealing with one rep providing incomplete information, I was passed on to another rep, a sales rep.  The information was still incorrect and I asked for a quote to view in writing.  They said they could not fulfill the request.Luckily no damages occurred as I did not book the service.  What are the consumer's rights?  How are we able to receive a quotation for services requested BEFORE the work is booked?  How can we protect ourselves from bait and switch techniques such as monthly rates changing the month after service is installed (after receiving loss leader enticing rates)?  I have a copy of the chat messages with the sales reps, each passing on the responsibility to another party with no escalation to a manager."
"Doreen of Toms River, NJ",6/28/2008,,"How dare Comcast's subcontractor J & E Enterprises think they can tresspass on my property, dig up my lawn and tell me: On July 1st 2008 we will digging up your property  I said I think NOT Then this p[erson] had the nerve to tell me  you have no choice in the matter, we will contact the police and have you arrested if you interfere.  I then called the owner of this scam business and he told me the same thing.  I have written my local polititions and after knocking on door onh my block it appears the entire naborhood is up in arms.  I am now looking at the legalities of permits applied for.  And the legalities of digging up the right-of-ways. [They] may not need a permit to dig up an easement BUT need a permit to dig a right-of-way. Ruining my lawn, threats of having me arrested if I interfere.  Threatened at my door step by a sub-comtractor of Comcast, not to mention the are is not marked up as per NJ state law so there is no concern or precautions taken for safety"
"A of Palmer, MA",6/28/2008,,Comcast hi-speed internet at $42.99 before taxes and fees is a worthless frustrating waste of time.  The signal drops at least 50% of the time.  I was told to upgrade my computer which I did and it is even worse.  Why are there no choices other than comcast?  I thought that monopolies weren't allowed in this country?
"Marco of Berwyn, IL",6/28/2008,,"I have been a Comcast customer for a grand total of two weeks.  I have an HD cable box and internet.  Two days ago, both services abruptly cut out.  They totally lost all signal.  I called customer service, sat on hold for 30 minutes and when I finally talked to someone the only solution they could offer me was to send a technician out IN A WEEK!  Here I am....paying $150/month, ALL my services are out....you would think they would send someone out immediately or in the very least, the next day.  But I guess since Im already a paying sucker, they feel like they can take a relaxed attitude towards my problem.  Being somewhat technically adept, I decided to grab a wrench and take a look at my condo's cable box.  I was surprised to find that someone had removed my cable from the signal source and put another cable in it's place.  I got the apartment number and went to their door.  At this point, I thought that this person had done this themselves in an attempt to steal cable.  To my surprise, when they opened the door...standing in their living room was a COMCAST TECHNICIAN!  It was around 6 PM so I am convinced he was trying to get home....he figured, As long as I hook this lady up, screw the other guy.  He can file a complaint later and it will never get back to me!  My cable line has all the appropriate tags.  Any Comcast technician who has worked there for more than a day should be able to identify a customer's lines by these tags.  Yet he had no regard for me.  Simply unplugged me to finish his job. I had him hook my line back up and he left.  (Note: He never once apologized.  On the contrary, he treated me as if I was causing HIM some kind of inconvenience.)  The next day, I notice that my internet is going at about quarter speed.  Also, my ON DEMAND service is completely disabled.  So I go back down to the box and see that the technician, in an attempt to boost my neighbor's signal, has put her line directly into the signal source (where my line USED to be).  Now if you know nothing about cable wiring, you may not understand this next part.  He took my line and put it on a splitter.  Understandable....sometimes necessary.  However, THERE IS NO OTHER LINE ON THE SPLITTER!  Its just the main cable line going into the splitter and my one line coming out.  He could have used a connector to put the two lines together but used the splitter instead, cutting my signal down 3.5 in the process.  This guy was NOT a trainee....he was working alone, which means he has been there for a few months.  His work shows that he has NO IDEA what he is doing.  It is pathetic that such a HUGE company that charges SO MUCH would send someone like this to represent their company.    I am planning on going into the office tomorrow IN PERSON."
"Larry of Savannah, GA",6/28/2008,,"I switched my service from Comcast Business Phone to Access Integrated Network.  After the switch was made, we can no longer receive calls from anyone who is using Comcast phone service.  When the call is made from a Comcast phone to our business,the phone does not ring and the call goes directly to voice mail.I have been trying for a week to get Comcast to fix the problem, but so far nothing has been accomplised.  Comcast is not acknowledging that the problem lies with them although it's evident it does.AT&T,Access Integrated Network and Comcast agree that the problem is a translation problem.  I can't see why they can't get the problem resolved.We have many customers who call our place of business with inquiries about our products or to order something from us. We could be losing potential sales and future customers.  I can't put a dollar figure on what we may be losing."
"Polly of Okemos, MI",6/29/2008,,"Our family are comcast customers for years. During this past week comcast customer sevice has demonstrated absolutely the worst service I have ever received. Three days ago I scheduled an appointment,to install a cable for highspeed internet I ordered waited 4 hours and called comcast ten times for service! Noone ever showed or called to let us know anything I decided to schedule another appointment to install the cable for high speed internet. This time the appointment was scheduled for Saturday between 2pm and 5 pm Once again noone called or showed. WE HAD to call over and over to finally get any lame excuse why someone was not here 7 hrs later. Finally a  technician shows up at 9:30 p.m to inform us the work would take 2 hrs to complete and wouldnt do it then it was too dark. So, therefore,on Sunday comcast ordered an appointment at 8 am till 10:00 am. After getting up early and waiting again and  several calls today noone has called back or showed up. In fact they left last night with a unit uncovered and wired exposed to the weather. My Husband and I are apalled to be treated poorly with pathetic service, and we always have payed our bill on time! We know many people in this community and I'm not shy to communicate or inform the media. Seriously if you were treated this way wouldn't it be wise to seek another communication service?"
"Elizabeth of Lowell, MA",6/29/2008,,"I had services installed on 5/28/08. In fact in 6/08/08 I had a billed from Comcast that had to be paid in full by 6/11/08, it was only eight day after I had my services installed. I call customer services and spoke to Racheal and she told me that I had fallen in the cycle of there billing which for once I didn't believe her because still to this day I donm't know there billing cycle the statment read as from 5/28/08 to 6/27/08 but I had to paid by 6/11/08.I also ask if they could fix my last name, but they weren't able too. The fact is that I had to go in person to comcast here Lowell, MA and had my last name fix. How incovience I had surgery in 6/20/08 and paid Comcast a visit on 6/24/08 again I ask the same question about the bill, by the customer serives made references that it was like when a person subscribe to a magizine you paid first for there services and brushed it off. That made me very upset. Now I received another billed from comcast and it is due on 7/04/08, try to email them but it has been impossible, I wish to know in how many day it take them to  generate a bill or there billing cycle. The reason they keep changing the day of payments. I paid the first bill on 6/24/08 for the amount of  $101.33 and have written another for $72.42. Ironically, it's been 31 day of having comcast has my internet and phone porvider. If this continue I would like to know my right to cancled their services and not pay one more penny. I live of SSID and all what I was looking to decresed my phone bill and internet because I need my PC I,m a senior at community College.  Please hlep me out here I got the worst deal of my life. Thank You"
"Kristen of Webster, TX",6/30/2008,,"We have had problems with the cable television.  We have not been able to watch, mainly during prime time, due to digital blocking, screeching, sticking, burping, etc. We began making phone calls in April 2008 and Comcast sent guys out who didn't have a clue.  Because it occurs during prime time, cable guys don't work prime time, the problem was never happening. They said our signal was strong, it wasn't in our yard, and it wasn't on the main line.  I made repeated calls and the customer service reps kept circling me through the same redundant process.  I would ask to speak to supervisors and was denied.  Then I began getting billed for the cable guys to come out do the same tests and come to the same conclusions as the others.  I called and spoke to Brenda, supervisor, in billing who assured me that I would receive credit for my interrupted television as soon as they, Comcast, determined the problem and remedied it.  I had been calling since April this call occurred on 5/30.  That meant that as long as Comcast didn't fix my cable I still had to pay for it and I would not receive a credit until they fixed it.  On the phone again, this time two phones at a time, one to complain about the problem, and assure the rep he couldn't help me, I needed a supervisor, and one phone to complain about the representative I was speaking to who wouldn't help me.  Some how I made it to another manager, Joe, who assured me that with in 72 hours all would be fixed and credit to my account would me made.  Not so.  I began my two fisted phone calls for the next three days and on Saturday, 6/8 an expeditor cable tech showed up and ran the problem all the way back to the main hub in Alvin, which is what I kept telling the customer service reps.  This guy did finally show up and fix the problem.  I now should get my credit of mid April to mid June. NO.  I call again.   This time Jennifer refuses to let me speak to a supervisor although she can't possibly give me a credit.  I insisted and insisted and finally she said that  Michael would look into my case and call me back.  When I had not heard from him I called and again, no such person.  I was told at one point that because I didn't call everyday I was was only granted two days of credit in April. Comcast says we owe $301.00 for 2 months of them not delivering service to our home.  We pay $120/month for cable, plus service calls that had nothing to do with our television of $26 each call.  They owe us a minimum of $270.  We owe $31, but comcast doesn't agree."
"Marni of Arlington, VA",7/1/2008,,"I moved from Reston to Arlington and continued my service with Comcast for Internet, Cable and phone.  When it was installed in March 2008 it took the technician two days to get it installed.  After about a week it started freezing and not working properly.  We ignored it and finally called in April to get a technician to come out and fix it.  One came out and switched out the boxes 3 times because each box he tried to install did not work.  On the 3rd try he finally got them working however, a week later the box shut off completely.  I called to get them to come back out and fix it and they did not show up for the appointment.  They issued me a credit and rescheduled the appt.  Once again they did not show up.  This has been going on since May.  I keep scheduling appointments and they continue to not show up either because their car broke down, they said they called when they never did or they are unable to make it during the window given.  I have scheduled 8 appointments since May and still cannot get a technician to come out and fix the issue.  I was told by several customer service reps that they issued credits for every appt missed.  I just spoke to a supervisor who said she had no record of these credits.  I've also received a bill for 160 for service I have not been receiving.  My cable doesn't even turn on.  The technicians have been giving their reps false information about calling me prior to the visit when I never receive a phone call.  At this point I'm getting ready to cancel my service with them however, I cannot find another provider in my area so I have no other options now.  I've never spoken to an understanding representative and I've been told several times they are short on technicians.  This might be why they have not shown up to the last 8 scheduled appointments.  At this point, I feel justified in not paying the fees because I have no working service.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm being charged for service that I'm not getting and faulty equipment.  Also, I am extremely stressed out and frustrated because I'm not getting any where. I spend too many hours on the phone with Comcast trying to resolve this as well as too many hours waiting to find out if they will show up."
"Tejas of Shelby Township, MI",7/1/2008,," I told Comacast to lower my Internet service to low speed from high speed to save money. They told me on phone that they did it. For next month I was billed less money. The month after that I was charged higer again. So, I called them to find out why. They told me that nobody ever reduced my service to lower speed and i did not check my bills properly. I did not remember what date I called them to reduce the charge. (if I dig my phone records,it will show though). So now because I don't remeber the date I told them to reduce service, I am made to pay higher prices  from that point onwards including last months difference!( they say that they put multiple product discount which I did not had, how in the world I know their billing terminology?)       6 months ago they were charging me for DVR services on cable when I never asked them for DVR. The technician who came to install said he had only DVR reciever not regular one. Was it my fault he did not had regular reciever.     They are the most unethical company in the world. Cheating and dishonesty is their motto.For cable services I was overcharged for multiple months extra money for DVR reciever. $11/month vs $5.95/month.    For internet services, I am charged for higher product of $57.95 vs low speed product of appx $39. (for 2 months)   In both cases, I got the products they charged me for. But I did not ordered them. I ordered lower products."
"Tracy of Carpinteria, CA",7/2/2008,,"Company abused my time by trying to sell a product that was not actually available in the area.  The rep went through the whole sales pitch about what products WERE available, signed me up for cable and internet, and then the rep really pushed Blockbuster Total Access service down my throat, despite the fact I told him six times I already have the service. When he patches me through to the installation department, I get a gruff individual informing me their systems were down, and to call back in 30 minutes  not very comforting!  Naturally, the installation dept number I was given by the sales rep did NOT get me back to the installation dept.  Then, after another 20 minutes on the phone, I am notified that none of the services are available after all, and now I have to deal with cancelling the new blockbuster account that I never needed in the first place.   I cannot believe how absolutely terrible customer service has become.  Reps are not educated on how to use their systems, or how to determine product availability, and then when they are caught on the hop they try to talk their way out of it by giving really pathetic excuses, which always end up reflecting poorly on the company itself.  I really think consumers need to be able to bill their time back to companies like these.  It's unacceptable to waste a consumer's time, and I will NEVER use Comcast in the future.  I'll read a book or use dial up to access the internet before I subject myself to that abuse again.  This is beyond ridiculous.I ALMOST took a day off of work to be there for the installation.  But my emotional distress is beyond measure."
"Darlene of Montgomery Village, MD",7/2/2008,,"I receved my monthly bill from Comcast and I found a onetime charge of $125.00.When I inquired about this charge they said that a check was returned in April 2005. I totally disagree with this as I don't recall any checks being returned, my question to them is why did it take them 3 years to find this out. When I moved my residence I cancelled my services and after moving I got the service back again, at least at that time they should have known that I owe this amount. I refused to pay this amount.Services were disconnected due to past due balance."
"Thomas of Seattle, WA",7/3/2008,,They refuse to put the price of there hight spped internet to $20.00 a month.  
"Walter of Sugar Land, TX",7/3/2008,,"I tried for about 2 years to cancel Comcast commercial Internet account and switch to residential. Only after I complained to the BBB could I even get an employee who knew how to handle the situation. I wanted 1 year of refund of the difference in price. They offered 3 months, which in my view is them admitting they made the mistake in the first place.I was charged $210.88 every month, but should have been charged their residential rates of $50 or so. This went on for years. I was willing to settle for 1 year's refund."
"Jerry of Bloomfield Hills, MI",7/3/2008,,"I have had comcast cable for years for tv, it has been ok.  I used to have Roadrunner cable (which was great), until Comcast bought them out.  Then immediately, they capped the bandwidth down to almost nothing.  They slowly have been bringing back up to an acceptable level.  However...they are so misleading and dishonest.  I pay extra for their higher tier internet service.  Do I get? Of course not!  They recently upped their internet bandwidth to 16 Megs downstream and 2 megs upstream.  Do I get that? Ha!  They tell you to go to Speak-ezy and do a speed test, but what they don't tell you is, that speed test is worthless, since they have this misleading thing called speedboost.  What speedboost does it DOUBBLES your bandwidth for a few seconds, then it adjusts to what you are really getting. I have NEVER gotten what they promised.  I have had techs out almost once a week, and they tell is it's acceptable.  I said to the one that was out today, I'm only getting 8 megs, i'm paying for the 16 meg service.  He actually told me, well 8 megs is acceptable, i'd be very happy with that.  AT which point I said, I'm paying for 16 megs and I was told I'd get 16 meg service!  Again he said, well we say UP TO 16 megs.  So they can give you 2 meg service, (which is what i was getting last night), and they are still within their legal rights.  There is NO WAY they can give 16 megs service to those houses.  They can't even give 8 meg service...they have to take the two leads and split them several times to give service period.They talked me into their stupid digital phone service. So I finally took the bate after being hounded to death.  ONly a few days after I accepted it, the power went out, and we lost all services.  Why?  because they didn't have a backup generator on our node.  Now my phone service is not $33 a month as they advertised, but now it's $36 a month, because again fail to tell you they have to charge you for a modem fee too.  I had already bought and was using my modem for my cable tv and internet.  So now to get my internet speed back up, they have to come and put my modem back in for the internet and leave their modem for the phones and tv.  Well it means again, loss of signal because they have to split the signal from their modem to mine.  I can't wait until Fibreoptics are in here, i'll be gone like the wind."
"Jamie of Stansbury Park, UT",7/3/2008,,"Comcast had sent 2 men to my home on June 3, 2008. When the men arrived they accused me of stealing cable. mind you I had been a customer of there's for over 4 years.  The men pushed their way into my home and began searching my home, all rooms, even basement which is unfinished. I asked them to leave and that they had no business being there or searching my home. They said that If I bothered them again then they were going to disconnct my service. After they left I telephoned comcast, they said they had no work order to even be at my home, there wasno proof that they were ever at my home. I said I could describe the men, they said due to company policy they were unable to offer that as a solution. The following day comcast re appeared at my home to fix a cable box outside, apparently that is the only reason they were ever dispatched to my home. I never had a work order through them. Not only did the tresspass, they threatened me and my family, forced entry and was very ignorant. comcast has been playing cat and mouse with me since to settle on a resolution to this event. In my opinion watch out, comcast is a untrustworthy company to do business with and they have no problem breaking the law. "
"Bill of Jax, FL",7/4/2008,,"On Monday June 30, 2008 Comcast came to install my new neighbor's service. The contractor installers laid the temporary cable in my yard when they could have easily laid it in the new customer's yard. I asked the two installers if they were going to leave it like that and they said it was temporary and the the burial crew would fix it. I also asked if they had plans to dig up  my yard, again I was told the burial crew would handle it. July 3, 2008 I get home from work at 1615 EST to find that Comcast has indeed buried my neighbor's service drop through my yard tearing up the grass on both sides of the sidewalk as well as leaving the orange warning tape and their plastic water bottles in MY yard.   So I get on the phone immediately with Comcast and start my complaint. I am told that a supervisor named Dave will come and see me. I waited patiently at my house until 2030 EST, stood up by the supervisor. When I got up at 0430 on July 4, I called again to start the ball rolling on a supervisor callback and was told the supervisors dont come in until 0800, but that one would call me as soon as they got to work. Well, 0800 comes and goes and no call so I call them again at 0830. Now I'm told again that I would be receiving a call. Now its 1030 and I have called again this time I am given a complaint form number and a telephone number I can call on Monday July 7 to follow up with my complaint. PITIFUL........  So now I have to look at my tore up trashed out front yard all weekend because Comcast is not capable of sending competent technicians to do their installs.   In July of 2006 when I moved into this house, Comcast destroyed the same part of my yard in their attempt to repair the interface in the pedestal in my front yard. After complaing about the mess they left, I was told they would come and clean up the mess. Guess what.......it never happened. Again I was swept under the carpet by Comcast.  While I enjoy their broadband service when its up and running, I have to say they have by far the WORST customer service of any communications company I have ever dealt with and I have dealt with many over the last 26 years being in the Telecom/Communications business.    They wasted my time by missing appointments, trespassed on my property, dug up my yard and left their trash for me to pick up. And this is for my neighbor's service, not mine."
"Mary of Moraga, CA",7/5/2008,,"On April 15, 2008, Comcast employee Billy Woodley came to my home (unsolicited). He was interested in what home phone service we had. At the time we had Vonage phone service and were long-time Comcast cable and internet customers. We had purchased an HD tv in December 2007. At that time, Comcast gave us a 6 month special for upgrading cable tv service to digital preferred plus for $59.99 per month. This service provided more channels than our previous plan, including HD channels. Mr. Woodley said that if we switched from Vonage to Comcast voice that we would continue to receive the same preferred tv plan at the same price after our 6 month special expired, and the comcast voice would be slightly lower in price than our current Vonage price. This sounded like a good idea, so we agreed. Vonage charged us $40 to discontinue their service, but we were still going to get the special price for our cable upgrade. However, when we received our June 2008 statement, our cable tv price had gone up to $103.94 from our $59.99 special. We called Comcast customer service. They said they had no record that we were to continue receiving the same cable package for the same price and refused to reduce our price according to what Mr. Woodley told us. We also called Mr. Woodley's telephone number a couple of times and left messages. He never returned our calls. We are VERY angry about this. We threatened to cancel Comcast service but the customer service people didn't care. We were lied to and feel that we should be given what we were promised and that the employee should be disciplined/fired.We paid a $40 fee to cancel our Vonage phone service, and are now being charge an additional $43 per month for cable, which is not what we were told we would be charged."
"Mr. of Punta Gorda, FL",7/7/2008,,"I am an avid game player. Recently, most Comcast customers as well as customers of Warner Cable have complained about connection issues with online game. We are experiencing low fps, stutters, packet losses that are over 100% and resulting in massive numbers of CTDs. I even went so far as post my frustrations on in game chat and was immediately given a system wide response to All players that CRS was experiencing problems with both Comcast and Warner Cable which they were trying to resolve with Comcast and Warner Cable companies. The problem, we're told, lies in the band width both Comcast and Warner Cable companies are allowing their customers. CRS tells it's game customers that we should take it up directly with their IS providers. I've done so many times but with no good results as regards Comcast's affording any greater band with that I now currently have. At this point I can do no more than submit this complaint and hope that it doesn't fall on deaf ears as had my past direct endeavors with Comcast.This game costs me $15 per month as a subscription fee. A subscription fee of small consequence to be sure. The lost benefit is not measurable except as viewed from a gaming enjoyment point of view.  I am paying Comcast for good IS provision yet I am not receiving it. I am paying CRS for the enjoyment of their game yet again, I am not receiving it. Both services cost me real dollars. Both are not delivering on their promises or their agreements to their customers."
"Sumaya of Washington, DC",7/8/2008,,"I am extremely disappointed and frustrated with Comcast's service. I placed an order last month through the internet. I ordered digital preferred with HBO for 39.99/month for six months and high speed internet for 19.99/month for six months. The installation fee was 29.99. I did not receieve an email confirmation so I called the office and the rep confirmed the rates for me. These rates are STILL on website. I paid the technician 92.93 after installation for installation and first month's charges as the rep told me I had to. This was on 06/08/2008. I just received a statement yesterday with completely different rates and was charged again for JUNE-JULY and for July-August. The rates are the normal rates. I was charged 53.21 for cable, 17.95 for HBO, 42.95 for internet, 20.95 for partial month bundle services (no idea what this is), and installation AGAIN, for a total of 199.52. To solve the issue, I first contacted my local office. After half an hour, I was told by both the representative and the supervisor that since I ordered this online, it could only be solved online through a customer service rep as they did not have the codes for internet promos. They could not even provide me with a phone number to contact for online support. So I got on the internet and signed onto chat system. I spoke with a representative for nearly an hour only to be told that they too do not have the necessary codes and I would have to contact my local office. I told her MANY times that I ALREADY called my local office and they were of no help. The chat rep insisted, however, that I call my local office as they would be the only ones that could help me. I then called this number to be told the same thing, that this could only be solved online because the local office does not have access to internet promo codes. This promo has not expired. IT IS ON [THEIR] CURRENT WEBSITE. Everyone has been USELESS and unable to help me. It is ridiculous for a company of Comcast's caliber to not have a copy of my work order for a rep to pull up. It is further unacceptable for the company to not have an account of what my 92.93 was for. All the reps told me that while they saw I had paid 92.93, they had absolutely no idea what it was for. I have wasted nearly 2 hours this morning trying to resolve this with absolutely no progress. Now I have to go home to get the work order during my lunch break, come back to work, then take the bus and train to go to the payment center with the HOPE that it MAY be solved, no guarantees.They have yet to resolve the issue. I am exhausted from trying to get what I should have gotten from the beginning."

"Kim of Alexandria, VA",7/10/2008,,"   After analyzing our communication bills, we made the decision to bundle our services (cable, internet and telephone landline) with Comcast.  I called Verizon and told them it was not a matter of service, but economics.  I arranged for Comcast to port our phone number to them and set up a bundled package.  An appointment was set up for July 7, 2008 between 3-6 pm.  At 6:30, I called Comcast and asked where the technician was.  I was told the dispatcher would call me.  They never did.  The technician showed up at 7:30 pm.  He started laying new cable and then asked me where the telephone switch was. We live in a high rise condo and I explained he needed to get the key from the desk and they would let him in.  He was uncomfortable with that information and insisted my husband go with him.  Up and down the elevator he would go, on his cell phone, talking to someone and telling them he didn't know how to do the work.  He finally left just before 11 and promised to come back on Wednesday, July 9, 2008 between 3-6 pm, bringing someone else with him to show him how do the work.  No one showed up.  We picked up the telephone to call to see where he was, and our line was dead.  When we called our phone number from our cell phone, the announcement said the number had been disconnected. After an hour on wait, Comcast said that because the work was not completed during a certain time the telephone number ""went back to Verizon.""  The Verizon repair service said that the number had been transferred to Comcast and they did not have it.  This morning I called Verizon to get service and they said they did not control the number, it was still at Comcast.  I had to go through the entire credit and approval process to arrange to get the service back to Verizon.  I will have to wait a week before Verizon can send someone to my home to repair all the damage the Comcast technician did on the 7th of July.  In the mean time, I need to get that recording off my number for security purposes. Comcast kept me on hold for 2 and a half hours this morning until I had to go to a meeting.  I transferred the call to my husband.  He was on hold for an hour before someone came on and said a supervisor would call us back.  No one called. I came out of my meeting and took up the next watch.  Someone from technical support came on and told me that the switch room cant get a dial tone on the line as the work from 7 July has to be fixed.  I was then transferred to Sales, where I was put on hold.  Mark, operator number 4330, said I needed to go to technical support again.   Luckily, technical support was still on the line and interrupted him, stepping him through the process of looking through the case notes.  It appeared that someone deleted the work order on July 8, 2008, and another work order has to be put in.  In the mean time, everyone who calls our home number thinks we skipped town.  I am now waiting to see if Mark will fulfill his promise to call me back and if someone can come to my home tonight, get me dial tone so the recording comes off and for Verizon to port over my number on the 17th of July.  Oh yes, did you know a number cannot be ported over unless it is active with a dial tone? We now have a complaint in to our local government and will be filing one with the FCC.  Should you ever be tempted to give your telephone service to Comcast, don't do it.  They are selling services they know they cannot provide. My husband has lost two days of leave. I have no phone service at my house, with a recording on the number that makes it sound as though I have skipped town. Due to the nature of my work, I am in violation of my organizational policy. We have no idea if this will ever be resolved. I have to fix the damage to my home. I have to pay Verizon to take me back as a customer.

"Dennis of Woodbridge,, VA",7/10/2008,,"I am writing to regards to my credit report.  At one time, approximately 6 six years ago, I lived in Lake Ridge, Virginia.  I was receiving Comcast services during the time that I was living there.  However, once I moved out Comcast continued to bill me for four consecutive months afterwards. The bill accrued over $150. I disputed it because I no longer lived at the residence, and they said that they would decreased the bill to $70.00 and if I brought in the lease agreement stating my last day living at the address then they would clear the account completely.  The next day I brought them the lease agreement.  I spoke to a supervisor at Comcast and the indicated that they would fix the billing.  However, recently I checked on my credit history, and it indicated that the billing from Comcast had gone to a collection agency.  I feel that the supervisor that I spoke with (I dont recall the name) dropped the ball and did not take care of the clearing and crediting my account, and that my credit report should not have this incident on it.  Can you advise me on how to resolve this matter?  I have gone to Rolling Brooke Rental Office to retrieve a copy of my rental agreement but to no avail.  They do not have records that far back.  And I have gone to Comcast and they couldnt find any record of my account.  So where do I go from here.  I want my credit report cleared.  I was under the impression that it was clear up until one month ago.   My beacon score is affected.  I do not want this on my credit report.  I want it removed."
"Claire of Hallandale Beach, FL",7/10/2008,,I recently moved and thought that Comcast had great specials and would proove to be a good cable company.  Boy was I wrong.  My service never worked!  I had a DVR that was replaced 4 times over a 4 month period and never worked.  I had to spend numerous hours on the phone with customer service to get no resolution or help.  When I had finally had enough I asked to speak to a supervisor I went strait to voicemail and left many many messages and to this day have never received a call in return.  I had them come and get their faulty equipment and refuse to do any buisness with them ever agian.  I work in Customer Service and I have never seen a company so Poorly managed.  I warn anyone looking into Comcast to stay far away.  They will take your money and give you nothing in return!  They use faulty equipment and have no concern for their customers. I will never make the mistake of using them ever agin.
"Ann of Albuquerque, NM",7/12/2008,,"I have cable, internet, and phone service with Comcast.  In the last year, I have had technicians out to my house 25 TIMES. I am not exaggerating. I have had conflicting reports about the problem.  One would fix one thing and create a new problem.  The next one would fix that problem and create a new one.  I was constantly told different things.  I bought equipment on their recommendation and took it back on their recommendation.  They would switch out cards on my high definition Tivo at least 12 visits.  I finally took it back and they tried to make their DVR work.  It has been a nightmare.  I have it all documented with all the slips.I am self employed so the financial cost based on my time and hassle totals well over $2500.00.  The emotional and hassle problems have been tremendous."
"Laura of Canton, MI",7/14/2008,,"I have had and am having so many problems with Comcast, 1. They lie about prices they will charge you 2. the phone service is very poor 3. the technicians often don't show up for service appointments 4. they add additional charges to bills without telling you - once they double-charged me for each service and it took about a month and countless phone calls for them to sort it out 5. they have terribly long wait times for customer service, and I have been on hold for over 1/2 hour, then hung up on 6. they say they will transfer you to a manager, but after 1/2 hour on hold you find yourself talking to just anothe regular customer service representative 7. their representatives are often completely ignorant and rude 8. if you write their corporate offices, and, unlike honorable, self-respecting companies, they won't help you, leading me to believe that the above problems are company policy.Frequent loss of phone service; an immense amount of time and nerves spent on hold and talking to Comcast reps who often can't help you."
"Nancy of San Rafael, CA",7/14/2008,,"I have Comcast internet service and have been fairly happy with it until recently.  Approximately 50% of the time that I attempt to access my email through their website, I receive an error message saying my login failed.  I have had at least a dozen phone calls with Comcast techs and nothing they suggest cures the problem.  In fact, since I started complaining about it, the problems have actually increased to the point where there are entire days that I am unable to access my email due to this issue.  Although I have repeatedly complained to Comcast they have repeatedly failed to address this issue at all!  They tell me it is a problem with ME -- oh, please!  How difficult is it to access your email?  Also this occurs while I am actually reading my email at times -- it will suddently crash and I can not access it again until many hours and too may attempts later.  Comcast Customer Service is a joke.  They do not care at all if you have difficulties and they make absolutely no attempt to fix anything that isn't easily fixable. I have lost many hours of productive work time in attemtpting to remedy this problem."
"Lew of Glenwood, MD",7/14/2008,,"Comcast eliminated local access to Wash DC channels, citing them as duplicative of Baltimore channels. i live as close to DC as to Baltimore, and work in Fairfax VA. I watch (used to watch) DC traffic reports every morning before leaving for work. now i can't do that. and i don't have access to another cable company. i would dump Comcast if i had the option for another company. i resent their elimination of the DC channels.i can no longer become aware of accidents on the route i take to work, some of which close the roads."
"T of Hercules, CA",7/15/2008,,After two months of very bad service they turned off my phone after placing order to return to At&t.  Comcast turned off phone two days before scheduled disconnect date and would not turn on unless i canceled my At&t service.  Although I had an elderly person in home I was not able to dial 911 i informed them of this and they said to badd that's my problem. PLEASE DO NOT USE THEM!  YOU WILL REGRET IT!
"Patti of Bordentown, NJ",7/16/2008,,"After much research on the internet, for comcast deals, I pick the package I wanted along with the promotional advantages. $75.00 cash back for digital cable $100.00 cash back for High speed internet. $50.00 cash back for digital voice. The bundle would be $99.00 a month.  I called the number to sign up for this bundle. I was told that I needed to clear up a past due amount of 187.00 that was owned on the account since 2002. I was not even aware of the fact that I owed a balance. I had returned comcast equipment in 2002, to go to Direct TV, and was never told I had a balance? Never the less I paid the balance thinking that it was the year my father died and maybe I made an error. I never received any notices.  I was assured that I could sign up for the bundle as soon as I paid the balance. I payed it. Next, I called back the next day and got another rep that put thru my order, but at the last moment the screen said that I had made a duplicate order online and he could not process my order. I had to call customer service again. I figured that was an easy fix since I tried yesterday, they just had to correct something for me to purchase online again. I called and spoke to another rep that told me that I could not have the bundle,because of my Past account. She said the phone representative would never of been able to put that thru, that I was not considered a NEW customer even though it states that I would be after so many months, (it was 6 years since I was a comcast customer). She stated I would have to start out by paying the full amount for the package I wanted, for at least 3 months, and then they would consider putting me into a package. This new package would cost over 175.00 a month in comparison to the bundle which was $99.00 a month. She said that was because my services were terminated for non payment. Non of that was true. She said the only way I could become a new customer is if I moved to another state. phew! I felt like a criminal. I asked if there was anyway I could talk to someone in the office of comcast that was nearest my home, She stated that they have ""walk ins"" and I could go if I wanted to. I decided to try to talk to someone directly, so I went to my Comcast office (Willingboro, NJ) and after waiting in line for 30 minutes was told that no one was able to see me. I went home and on the way, I called and spoke to another representitive of comcast. I just could not beleive this, it did not make sense to me. He told me that the information I obtained was false and untrue. My past account did not show any bad history of payment. I could qualify for the bundle.  He directed my call to a very polite lady named Monica that took my order. My complaint is: If I would of been allowed to go on line and get the same bundle that was offered to me on the phone,  I would of been eligible for rebates that added up to $225.00 cash back. I feel this is a scam and should be looked into. When the representative that tried to process my order online, told me that it said"" that an duplicate order was found"", and he could not process my order"", I showed my concern and he told me not to worry, call this number, that it happens all the time"".  I feel that something should be done about this scam. It it unfair. Part of wanting Comcast was because of the rebates that were offered. I finally got so frustrated I signed up for the bundle on the phone since I knew there was nothing I could do to get the offer that should of be allowed to me online. If you google the different sites there are so many rebates to choose from, and yet I wonder if anyone of them are true? Also, I was told after this happened to me that a close aquantance worked in customer service for Comcast and so many deceptions are told to people all the time. He said it is very unfair and misleading. Stress and losing my online rebate because of deception."
"Barbara of Dundalk, MD",7/16/2008,,I was unable to purchase a movie on pay per view because they said they had not received my payment.  My payment was sent in ten days ago.  I have been a customer for over 15 years so it should not matter if they are getting my payment late.  They could check my credit and see that they are safe with me.  I feel an exception should have been made and they should do whatever necessary to make it work for me.  And they were rude on the phone.no economic consequences other than the fact that I will probably cancel my service and stop giving them my money!
"Veronica of Salem, NH",7/17/2008,,"I subscribe to Comcast Expanded Basic Cable -- analog, not digital This means I get, for example, CNN and ESPN, but not premium channels like HBO. The rules for service are covered in an agreement between the Town of Salem, NH and Comcast. Some months ago, Comcast dropped Channel 48, ESPN Classic. When I inquired, I was told it had moved to a channel number in the 200 range used by digital, which I cannot receive. I asked if there would be a reduction in monthly charges. I was told no. Then some weeks back Comcast did the same thing with a CSPAN channel. And today, I watched a banner on Channel 40, MSNBC telling me it too was moving to the digital side. It is blatantly unfair for Comcast to do this, and in the extreme, I could end up paying  $40 or so for a single channel. A very un-American way of doing business.I can't imagine any other business that contracts to provide a service for an agreed amount, and during the currency of that contract reduces the service and expects to receive the same payment. To call it by another name, try robbery. I have reported this to the Town of Salem, NH after reading their agreement with Comcast. To my unlegal mind, there are clauses in the contract which require Comcast to provide the service they agreed to. In addition, the agreement refers to the quality of service. Since the switch to digital began, my picture will very often go blocky. Clearly the analog and digital signals are interfering with each other. So not only does Comcast engage in robbery, they have not kept up their agreement in terms of delivery quality."
"Evelynne of Norton, MA",7/18/2008,,"Sales people and TV people have stated that if you subscribe to cable you will not need the box. Well thats not altogether true.  If you have basic cable without a cable box, you are forced to buy a more expensive service that includes a cable box.  I dont wont or need the extra benefits of this more expensive services all I want is basic cable.  Cable is expensive enough without being forced to purchase the more expensive service having to monthly rent the box from the cable company.  No one can tell me if I purchase the box from Best Buy will that make my TV work with the very basic cable service.  And now that I face having to buy something I cant use or have replaced my expired coupon.I must now upgrade my service and pay an additional monthly charge for the rest of my life for something I don't want."
"Lori of South Burlington, VT",7/19/2008,,"Comcast removed 10 more channels from our line up this past week. They (Comcast) have been advertising on TV that if you have Comcast you don't have to worry, and that they will take care of everything regarding the switch to digital. Comcast also sent out postcards tellng people we could recieve a converter box FREE for one whole year to gain access to the channels they just moved to digital.   When I called Comcast and inquired about the coverter box, I was told I would have to pay $111.00 to qualify for the converter box. My Comcast bill typically runs 30 days behind,as the company bills in advance for services. I had just paid my bill on the 16th of July, and now on the 18th they want yet more money.   The FREE Converter box offer expires on August 15, 2008. After that date, it will cost Comcast customers $3.95 a month plus taxes to recieve the channels Comcast just moved and took off our line up.   I imagine there are many people like myself who do not have their Comcast bill current.   Comcast want me to continue to pay for a service I no longer have, and then charge me extra to recieve something that they just took away. I agreed to pay for the channel line up that I started out with at Comcast. Now, I have lost 10 additional channels, yet my bill have not gone down. I also will not be able to get the converter box as I do not have an additional $111.00 to pay before the 15th of August.   I think Comcast should have to do what they have been telling customers they will do. "
"Frank of Atlanta, GA",7/19/2008,,"I signed up for the $99 promo back in Feb 2007.  Again, never saw a $99 bill.  It was always $149.  Now, the $173 has thrown me over the edge.  One last thing, FOUR MONTHS Comcast debited my checking account TWICE for the same payment.  We can't issue a refund, you'll see the credit on your bill.  Is Bernie Ebbers running this company from prison?"
"Margie of Smyrna, TN",7/20/2008,,"My Comcast internet doesn't seem to be working.  I cannot send out.  Please help?  Do I need to do something?  It has been this way ever since I turned it on and I feel like I am losing my 19.99 time, which is only for 4 months.  thank you."
"David of Cambridge, MD",7/21/2008,,"Comcast cable tv in my area keeps going out, the sound goes from not being able to hear to blasting. The commericals turn greenish and comcast raised my monthly bill yet they took about 9 channels from me. Also sometimes when the cable goes out weak signal comes on the screen. Phone calls and e mails get me no-where."
"Carol of Pittsburgh, PA",7/23/2008,,"For the past several weeks, one PBS program, The New Hour, suffers many technical interruptions. I've contacted the local PBS station, and they say the problem is with Comcast, Comcast is aware of it, and has not told them that it would fix it.  I've tried to complain to Comcast, and have not been able to figure  out how to do so! This is unconsciounable--that Comcast would make it impossible to complain to them, and that they would ignore a problem that disrupts a popular program.  The damages are to the local PBS station, and to PBS nationally -- when long-time viewers of The News Hour, like me, are so irritated by the frequent technical twitching (at least every 5 minutes or so) that we switch to network news."
"Roberto of Miami, FL",7/24/2008,,"Ive been trying for the past hour to get through to internet security (the ones who can pull the plug on you if they think you are abusing your bandwidth) Anyway, I got through to this TOM guy, I had a few questions for him.  I did not want to give him my phone number, se HE HUNG UP ON ME! I refuse to go through the endless rounds of pressing numbers again to get through, so I called corporate headquarters. (It took my local office 5 minutes to locate and give me this number) Call them and complain (I did so anonymously, of course)  the receptionist seemed nice (her attitude may change if she starts getting a deluge of complaints) Call your local CORPORATE OFFICE to complain.   My wasted time on hold"
"Linda of Lowell, MA",7/24/2008,,"I am greatly distressed over what Comcast is capable of doing without consumer protection. My bill increased and instead of getting more, I am getting less. WHAT HAPPENED TO FREE TV. We had no choice to resort to cable because we needed the reception! When cable was first established it was COMMERCIAL FREE. It seems like I'm paying to watch COMMERCIALS, this has been my biggest complaint. As consumers, we still don't have a choice. I don't want any more channels, I don't want a digital box that I have to pay more for. I am disabled and on a fixed income, therefore I can't afford it. What about other low income families. I quess it's just too bad, because eventually we won't have a any channels. I will just watch DVD's. It's what I do anyway, because there's absoultely nothing on cable. So why am I paying for cable? We all have to get together and do something about this. I thought consumers had rights and choices. Everybody should just stop purchasing cable from Comcast until they can come up with an honest,affordable package for consumers. "
"Sharon of Portsmouth, NH",7/24/2008,,"I, like others, have TV sets that go up to only 99 channels. I am a Comcast subscriber and pay monthly for bundled services, including cable TV. I have wathed the analog-to-digital commercials and been certain that the issues did not affect me, since I do not use rabbit ears. What I have learned is this: Comcast is moving channels, such as MSNBC (40), in my area to higher channels (in this case, 251). For 99-channel TV sets that have a direct cable connection--no converter box--these new channels will not be received. Thus, consumers like me will be paying for services under contract that will no longer be provided by Comcast...unless we pay MORE. We have to rent a converter box to get these same channels we've been paying for all along. My question is, if the rabbit-ears customers are being inconvenienced by this digial switchover, and they are being provided some remedy (free converter boxes), why aren't we Comcast customers, who are losing services due to this switchover, being afforded the same courtesy?? I believe Comcast should provide free converter boxes in this case--or discounts to make up for the lost channels. I am being blackmailed into paying for something I already pay for. Comcast is violating their contract by denying me services without remedying the situation. They should give me a discount or provide free converter boxes. I have not willingly changed the terms of my service; rather, they have, without my agreement."
"B. of Houston, TX",7/25/2008,,"Been without cable service for a week due to a problem with the cable line.  Every day I have been promised that someone would come to fix it. To date the closest we've been to a technician is that one day saw a Comcast truck at my neighbors. He had gone to the wrong house!  Then, next day a technician showed up in the rain to say that he couldn't work on it because of the weather.Missed 3 days of work believing the promises that a technician will be here tomorrow as a priority from the telephone clerks."
"Mike of Troutville, VA",7/25/2008,,boy I have a good one for you please save your time and your money run for your life from comcast after a week still no tv they say there going to be at my home at 2pm laffin they call my cell phone at 12.00 and say IM here where are you good lord so i tell the man I can be home in just a few Im home in 7 minites and he is not here he calls and says he will see me later what a joke
"Cathy of Woodstock, GA",7/26/2008,,"   We have been Comcast customers since we moved into our new home last summer. Unbelievably, we have had ongoing problems with our phone, Internet, and cable services for an entire year! I am planning on canceling all of our series with Comcast in the very near future. At this moment (11:27 a.m.) I am waiting to speak to yet another supervisor who has no idea why my appointment today from 8:00 to 12:00 is not in the computer. The lady I have been speaking with is trying to convince me that I scheduled an appointment when I will be out of the country next week. I have scheduled service calls at least three times, written them down on my calendar, and waited at home for nothing. Each time I call to see what happened, I am told either there is no appointment scheduled or I have the wrong day. We have had our house rewired several times, our yard has been dug up, and my husband and I have taken off work to wait for technicians who never show up. When technicians do show up, there is no guarantee that they know what to do to fix our problems.  We have had so many problems that we have been refunded money and given a free sports package, but it still cannot make up for countless hours on the phone, countless hours waiting for technicians, and countless hours without reliable service. I have never experienced anything like Comcast's ineptness and disregard for quality service! Every time our phone goes out, our security system goes off-line and our Tivo system cannot provide program information. We have had so many problems that we have been refunded money and given a free sports package, but it still cannot make up for countless hours on the phone, countless hours waiting for technicians, and countless hours without reliable service.

"Abbie of Rineyville, KY",7/27/2008,,"July 19th the high speed internet service went down in my area for more than 48 hours.  Since then it has been up and down, but more down than anything else.  I have internet phone, so if I leave to go somewhere and the phones go out and my children have an emergency..how will they let anyone know? They can't.  This keeps my husband from doing the online parts of his college classes, and is effecting his grade and the best they could give me was a $6.00 refund for no service.  I to had been told a technician would come to my house and no one ever showed up.  Oh yeah and the customer service advised me to get in my car and find a wi-fi hotspot if I wanted internet...which is funny because thats what I thought I WAS PAYING THEM FOR?  We have no other choice for internet service in the area either,  I wish the cable industry had NEVER been deregulated, because they have us bent over a barrel and since they are the only providers they have no reason to provide good customer service.Time lost in school and being able to reply to emails from my customers"
"Mandy of Sunnyvale, CA",7/27/2008,,"I have a frustrating experience from beginning to end:  **** Installation: Ju;y 2005 **** Because we have internet connection problems, we have them come in to fix it.  Then, in an accusational tone, because they did not deactivate the services we accidentally obtain from the previous tenant's cable package, the cable guy talked to me like I am a suspect in an interrogation in the police office.  Like we should have reported to them that they made a mistake and gave us more programs that we paid for.  After dealing with very arrogant Comcast employees and continously disappointing unavailable internet connections, we decided to swith to SBC Yahoo (now AT&T).  *** Disconnection: July 2008 ****  Imagine being called after 9pm on your cell phone from the cable guy asking you to QA whether the cable got disconnected!  Then, he HUNG UP on me after I was so nice to actually move my butt and meander through heaps of boxses (amidst packing + moving) to turn on the TV and gave him the answer."
"Lois of Redmond, WA",7/27/2008,,"I'm complaining about the complainers.  I have called Comcast three times with problems.  They have been prompt, professional and polite.  "
"Felecia of Albuquerque, NM",7/27/2008,,"I am trying to watch my budget and called to cancel my TV service with Cocast Cable. I advised the representative that I would be keeping my high speed internet. His first response is that I would be paying more for my internet because I would no longer have a bundle. I let him know that I was aware of that and still wanted to cancel. Then he told me that my speed on the internet would be slowed as I no longer had a bundle. He kept insisting that I just go down to a smaller TV package. I do not like being threatened. I became very determined to cancel TV (I spoke with the rep earlier this week and returned my DVR today) and now am researching options for high speed cable. In a few months, I may even go to Direct TV. I live in an apartment and because my management does not allow dishes to be mounted on the building, I had not gone with them to begin with. But I would rather not have TV, if I am not able to get dish, than do business any longer than I have to with Comcast. When I took my box back today, the rep told me that I was going to get my speed lowered online, but could pay $10 more every month and keep the speed (funny enough, that option was NEVER mentioned by the rep I talked to on the phone. I currently work for a call center in town and have actually worked for several other call centers (never Comcast) and have had to speak with customers who are unhappy and/or wnat to cancel. The key is to NEVER be rude to the customer because word of mouth advertising is very volatile. Besides that, if their situation ever changes, don't you wan them to think about coming back to your service? Thanks to that rep I spoke to on the phone, once I find a comparable internet speed, I will never do business with Comcast again. I will also do my best to make sure this story gets heard many, many times by as many people as I can tell it to. I will never do business with a complany that feels the only way to keep my business is to threaten me."
"Ted of Cumming, GA",7/27/2008,,Replaced box and never worked.  They tell you managers will call you and they never do.  Tell you they will get someone out and no one shows.  Then find out never even entered work order.  Without cable and no indication will ever get it fixed.
"Carol of Houston, TX",7/28/2008,,"We have the package that includes the cable, internet and phone.  We have been having problems for months and have called comcast several times.  About 3-4 months ago, the picture on cable started fading in and out. We Comcast and the technician told us the wiring had nicks in it and needed to be redone, but he couldn't do it. We needed to call and schedule for another technician to come do that. The second time we waited and no one showed up, and the no one could get in touch with the technician scheduled to come. So a third appointment was made. This time two technicians showed up an hour late, but they at least fix the problem...temporarily. The picture still fades in and out, and I just realized that when the cable acts up so does the phone. I can be on the phone talking and suddenly the person on the other end cannot hear me for about 30 seconds, then it clears up. I called last Friday to complain and fortunately, the phone would loose connection while I was talking to Comcast. He ran connection test and found that my connection was week. No other customer service person had told us that. Now the problem is getting someone to show when they say they will. I was given the time frame between 2-5 pm today. Took off work early, came home to wait, and wait, and wait. My husband called comcast at 5:00 pm exactly and found that there was not appointment for us today. Then he was told that the technician called and could not reach up. We found that the wrong number was listed for us. Each time we call Comcast with a problem, we have to update our phone numbers. For some reason, the numbers keep changing and we're told that they couldn't reach us. We've rescheduled AGAIN for a technician to come out and I'm not optimistic that they will. If I keep having problems with Comcast and their service doesn't improve, I will be changing.My time is very important. Each time we make an appointment, that means that I have to rearrange my schedule only for Comcast not to show. Today, it was four hours without pay to wait and them not show up. Comcast has a very poor service record with me and I'm getting tire of it."
"Sarah of New Haven, CT",7/28/2008,,"When Comcast come to install cable in 2007, items were stolen from my home during the time they were there. The technicians were two women, one of whom asked to use my bathroom about 3 times in the 40 minute visit. When I called the company, after seeing that jewelry items from my bathroom were stolen. I was deterred from filing a claim using intimidation tactics. When I moved apartments, I made an appointment to get my cable installed and requested that the same technician from before not come. They failed to note that request on my account as I had asked. It took me multiple calls to determine if the person who was coming, had, in fact, come to my apartment before. I finally decided to file a claim for the prior stolen items. However, I have received no customer service assistance in obtaining the status of my claim since, despite the claim being labeled as a priority #10, and the old technician being fired for theft (as I found out)! All calls into the claim officer who initially called telling me that he was handling the case go straight to voicemail. Attempting to get a supervisor on the phone is a joke - I have left messages 4 times and they are never returned. I have no other cable options in the area, so I'm stucking paying money to a company that doesn't even respect my own security or their own customer service standards  "
"Sarah of St. Paul, MN",7/28/2008,,"I moved about a mile in St. Paul to a new location and set up a transfer of my cable with Comcast. I was given a date and time for the transfer so I could have continued uninterrupted service.  On the day of our move, I went over to the new place and sat there for THREE HOURS waiting for a comcast installer to show up as promised. Finally I called when the latest time passed and asked what's up. I was told that the install had been canceled! It was canceled due to a bill for Time Warner in Minneapolis from 2002! I had moved with comcast several times and never had this happen, nor had they ever refused my service. I always paid my bills (on time too!) to comcast and suddenly they were blocking my cable and canceled my installation without even calling me because of a 2002 cable bill with Time Warner Cable that I hadn't even been privy to a bill on?   I wasted three hours waiting, and was left with NO channels.  I told them to go ahead and zero out my account entirely, that I'd be getting a dish.  What a way to treat a customer. I have given them a ton of my money for years, and never complained about their exorbitantly high costs. Never again.   Welcome to DSL and satellite and goodbye comcast and all your drama. We currently have no channels on our television at all and are wasting time researching different options for satellite which we could have done prior to moving had they called.  I wasted three hours on the day of moving waiting for them of my time due to their disrespect- again, a simple phone call that they don't want my business would have sufficed. I'm glad to give my business elsewhere. I sell on half.com and was unable to access the internet due to not having a connection to see if there were any issues with current sales or any new sales."
"Linda of Colorado Springs, CO",7/28/2008,,"I'm a Senior Citizen and had mistakenly overpaid Comcast bill by $160.00. via telephone on July 25.  I had already paid my bill on July 23,2008 for $213.00.  When I called and asked for a refund of the overpayment they said it would take 2-3 billing cycles in order for me to receive a check.  I told them it was unacceptable for the length of time as they accepted my money immediately!  Sorry but they suggested putting it towrd future billing, which I did not agree to.  They are using my money for services not received.  I am filing a complaint with the Attorney General and BBB in my state of Colorado but don't expect any help.  Maybe the media, whom they subsidise can help? Bet Not.  I'm considering switching to Direct Tv.No refund forthcoming and I can't pay my bills for the month because of this oversight."
"Aj of Windsor, CT",7/28/2008,,"ALERT!  You are NOT protected with your alarm system's monitoring if you have Comcast Digital Voice and the DV goes down.  Comcast DOES NOT tell you this when selling the DV.  In addition, your safety is compromised if someone (thief or worse) cuts your cable line.  Your alarm will ring but your monitoring system WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED that there is a problem.  Comcast will tell you if the power or cable TV goes out, your phone switches to a battery modem for phone service, thus your alarm monitoring is not interrupted.  But they don't tell you if someone cuts the cable line to your home you are NOW at the mercy of the buglar or WORSE.  This information should be given PRIOR to installing digital voice for the customer to make a decision.  This is a lawsuit waiting to happen"
"Vilma of Lyndhurst, NJ",7/28/2008,,"   I have reported this to the FTC, FCC, BBB, the Comcast SVP of Cstomer Operations, the State of New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and now here - and I will keep on going until something gets done! Today 07/27/2008 I called your Customer Service department to terminate only the phone portion of my Comcast Triple Play bundle, after having had QUITE a few service issues with the (lack of) service provided.  The Agent, Damien whom I spoke with at approximately 14:25 informed me there was no supervisor available for me to speak with, even AFTER I had informed him I intended to contact the Better, Business Bureau.  I was so unsatisfied with the outcome of our conversation that not only DID I file a complaint about Comcast with the BBB, I also filed one with The State of New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and will continue to search other mediums where I can report and/or complain about your company until we reach a satisfactory resolution to this problem. Here's what that call related to (if you are interested): I've been a loyal Comcast customer since 2001. I had Comcast of Northern Virginia and they provided me with excellent internet and cable service, it was by FAR superior and MUCH less expensive and I believe I NEVER had to call them for a technical or service issue.  Whatever franchise is now providing my current service in my area (Community ID: NJ0297) is sub-par and their products are unacceptable.  Since the beginning the service to my new apartment I've ran the entire gamut of service issues.  Please allow me to list them for you, since I feel you should be made aware. 1. The packages in NJ offer less for more money. 2. The fact that we have to use the old modems show how dated the service here really is. 3. When I went to the North Arlington Service center to get an additional DVR box, the lady who (for lack of a better word) 'helped' me, didn't bother to hang up from the personal call she was on, and while still on her cell phone, gave me a CCAT box but gave me the wrong connecting cable AND failed to give me an AC cable (to plug it into the wall) - I had to take time out from my busy day just to go back to get the right items. That box didn't work from the get go - there had been a tech who came out to look at it and got it to work some what but the Globo channel was still all pixilated and eventually the box stopped working completely.   4. The service in the room where the 2nd box was never right and it took me some time to notice as that is where my husband was supposed to watch his soccer - I never understood why he ended up watching it the living room instead - until one day when he had the living room TV occupied so I went back there to watch one of my shows on the 2nd box.  What do I find? Only local TV channels would show; yet I've been paying for the additional box, its DVR service and the packages (Globo PPV, Selecto, and Sports) since April!  I paid for services I never got!  I went back yet AGAIN to get another DVR box at the suggestion of a Customer Care rep who thought the box might be fried (at least she gave me a $50 credit) and IT TOO still didn't work!  It was a second tech who caught the the fact that the cables were plugged in backwards -- the first tech completely missed it. Finally, as of July it now finally works. 5. The phone service is unreliable.  Oftentimes I have to reset the modem just to get a dial-tone. Luckily if I have an emergency at least I have a cell phone. Yet, the main reason why I got the home phone service is my mother (for when she visits) and to call her when she's away - lengthy conversations on a tiny cell phone are very uncomfortable.  But the service is so slipshod that what's the point? 6. I used to use calling cards to call my mother in the Dominican Republic; I stopped using them towards the end of May and started just dialing her directly. That's when I noticed another major service issue, this time with the phone. When I would call her, I would get a dial tone (or have to reset the modem JUST to get one), then dial her number as usual (1-809-xxx-xxxx) and then it seemed my phone line would go dead - no sound; but she heard her phone ringing, she would answer it and talk, yet she couldn't hear me, nor I her (I couldn't even tell her phone had rang!). I made 30 or so calls like this (and paid for everyone them) even though I 'TECHNICALLY' never got through.  I thought maybe it was the phone lines over there (after all THEY'RE the one's that are a 3rd world country-that their phone system was failing was more plausible to me); and had her service provider (Codetel) troubleshoot her lines - all was well they said.  Now she's a 77 year old and I hadn't been able to speak with her for almost a week, I really needed to find out how she was doing - so I resorted to Operator Assisted calls, I made 5 or so assisted calls (and paid for those additional charges too); miraculously the operators were able to get through.  I called Comcast about this several times; once I was told to dial 011 first to make a call to the Dominican Republic (and this was technical service rep who said that)! Finally another rep told me that the international provider Comcast was using had the configuration wrong, and has since corrected it; that I could call the billing department to get credit - by now I'm so disgusted that I didn't even bother to get credited back.  So, supposedly now that the problem is allegedly corrected, to make matters even funnier.... 7. Now when I call my mom, I hear her line ring, we hear each other but its static-y & full of interference, and like we are talking over each other; so garbled & distorted we can't communicate. If I have something of real import to say I have to ask her to call ME, and her calls to me are always crystal clear. Yet I can't have her running up her bills like that.  I think the maybe issue is your phone service is digital and it can't handle international calls. Today (07/27/2008), around 14:10 I called my mom; it was 5 tortured minutes of constant repeating, more screaming, trying to modulate our voices just to be heard, and slowing down our speech patterns. I had to hang up from sheer frustration and get an operator to place another assisted call - and this time, even the operator assisted call got messed-up too.   Now, I've been a loyal Comcast customer for 7 years now, and for the last 8 months I've paid in full for a service I frankly feel I haven't been getting, after those last calls to my mom I had reached my fill and decided I had had it -- that I don't want this shabby service and would just get a conventional analog line from Verizon. So right afterwards I called Comcast to terminate the phone service immediately, a male rep who said his name was Damien said I would be billed a $150 penalty for early termination of my contract and my remaining services would go up to full price. I advised him that after so many issues with my service I intended to call the BBB and would rather speak with a supervisor first - he told me the was none available to speak with me and that I could schedule to have a technician come out and have a look at the problem. Not being offered any other alternatives from Damien, I had no choice but to accept the appointment for Tuesday the 29th between 9am and 12pm.  Yet I have to say that I'm VERY IRATE about having to take time out of MY schedule for YOUR service issues yet AGAIN.  I had plans for Tuesday and I'm a working person - I can't be doing this every time you guys fail! Quite frankly I don't care about paying full price for anything as long as I get what I pay for, but I feel that in this case the $150 penalty would be highly unjustified given the fact that the reason for the early termination is because Comcast hasn't lived up to it's end of 'our' agreement.  At this point, I really no longer wish to have any type of  relationship with Comcast - no cable, internet or phone - I would just as well go else where for my services but Comcast intends to have the gall to bill me for an early termination fee after all that has happened.  That's just appalling and absurd. Please let me know of any resolution to this situation which may be satisfactory and agreeable to both Comcast and my self. I thought maybe it was the phone lines over there (after all THEY'RE the one's that are a 3rd world country-that their phone system was failing was more plausible to me); and had her service provider (Codetel) troubleshoot her lines - all was well they said.  Now she's a 77 year old and I hadn't been able to speak with her for almost a week, I really needed to find out how she was doing - so I resorted to Operator Assisted calls, I made 5 or so assisted calls (and paid for those additional charges too); miraculously the operators were able to get through.

Now when I call my mom, I hear her line ring, we hear each other but its static-y & full of interference, and like we are talking over each other; so garbled & distorted we can't communicate. If I have something of real import to say I have to ask her to call ME, and her calls to me are always crystal clear. Yet I can't have her running up her bills like that.  I think the maybe issue is your phone service is digital and it can't handle international calls. Today (07/27/2008), around 14:10 I called my mom; it was 5 tortured minutes of constant repeating, more screaming, trying to modulate our voices just to be heard, and slowing down our speech patterns. I had to hang up from sheer frustration and get an operator to place another assisted call - and this time, even the operator assisted call got messed-up too.   Now, I've been a loyal Comcast customer for 7 years now, and for the last 8 months I've paid in full for a service I frankly feel I haven't been getting, after those last calls to my mom I had reached my fill and decided I had had it -- that I don't want this shabby service and would just get a conventional analog line from Verizon. So right afterwards I called Comcast to terminate the phone service immediately, a male rep who said his name was Damien said I would be billed a $150 penalty for early termination of my contract and my remaining services would go up to full price. I advised him that after so many issues with my service I intended to call the BBB and would rather speak with a supervisor first - he told me the was none available to speak with me and that I could schedule to have a technician come out and have a look at the problem. Not being offered any other alternatives from Damien, I had no choice but to accept the appointment for Tuesday the 29th between 9am and 12pm.  Yet I have to say that I'm VERY IRATE about having to take time out of MY schedule for YOUR service issues yet AGAIN.  I had plans for Tuesday and I'm a working person - I can't be doing this every time you guys fail! Quite frankly I don't care about paying full price for anything as long as I get what I pay for, but I feel that in this case the $150 penalty would be highly unjustified given the fact that the reason for the early termination is because Comcast hasn't lived up to it's end of 'our' agreement.  At this point, I really no longer wish to have any type of  relationship with Comcast - no cable, internet or phone - I would just as well go else where for my services but Comcast intends to have the gall to bill me for an early termination fee after all that has happened.  That's just appalling and absurd. Please let me know of any resolution to this situation which may be satisfactory and agreeable to both Comcast and my self.

"Jolene of Sacramento, CA",7/28/2008,,"We have finally canceled our television service because we cannot take it anymore. Our internet was down for two weeks, and every time we would call they would put us on hold until we hung up. Finally, after about 10 calls, we talked to someone and we just canceled our television service, just to spite them. The guy came out to put a hold on our tv service, and somehow canceled our second IP address. We call them, and they want us to pay ANOTHER activation fee to hook up the IP address WE ALREADY HAD, THAT THE TECHNICIAN CANCELED. They've done this several times: the tech comes out and somehow removes/destroys/alters our service, and they charge us AGAIN for something we already should have. We have looked at other services, but there are NO OTHER cable services in our area. PRETTY SCARY that next year everyone will have to switch to dish or cable, and comcast has a monopoly in our area. Even worse, there is NO ORGANIZATION, government or otherwise, that a consumer can complain about them. Right now we are between a rock and hard spot because we cannot afford and cannot have dish (we rent), we don't want dial-up, and comcast is the only cable in offered in our area.  Lame!  I just wish that there was someone/some place who CARED, or that Comcast would be forced to share their lines with another company. I would even PAY MORE to get cable through another company. I think what we're going to be forced to do is MOVE so we have more choices.-Everytime we have upgraded our service, the technician hasn't shown up for the appointment. We call, and we end up having to take more time off work/wait more hours for the technician to show up. -I have lost count of how many times they have hung up on us for complaining. -They customer service is rude, and none of them know what they are talking about EVER. It took 45 minutes (well, before they hung up on us) just to get them to tell us we didn't have a second IP address. Our internet goes down once a month--without fail. For at least a week, or sometimes, every night after 9 pm for several weeks. We have complained, and they say we're in a black out area. However, it's not removed from our bill. -We have had to take several days off of work in order to wait for the cable technician everytime we have to make an appointment. The Tech never shows, shows up several hours late, or we are forced to make a second appointment. This has happened ALMOST EVERY SINGLE TIME. Now, we are smart and make our appointment on Fridays, so at least we'll get a three day weekend."
"Leonardo of Flemington, NJ",7/30/2008,,I Have had problems with comcast since they took over our accounts as Patriot Media customers back some months ago from the very first bill being incorrectly stated which I managed to fix after many hours over the phone. Now this last problem seems to have no fix to it. I decided that Comcast my new provider of Digital Phone service was too expensive so I decided to get Vonage at the start of May of 2008 or rather at the end of April 2008. I had contacted Comcast about this change and asked that my billing be adjusted accordingly and I was assured it would be yet it was not and it continued to be billed dispite my continued efforts and many contacts to the support people. I even asked that they review their own records to see that no activity under their own accounting shows my phone number being used past the dates mentioned yet they insist on billing me for the time frame only discounting me a small $20 amount. I have tried to explain till I have been blue in the face with so many lies that I just do not know what else to do.My account has been threatened to be disconnected dispite my continued attempts to pay what I believe to be the correct amount on time and contact both billing and customer support by both email and phone.
"Brenda of Clinton, CT",7/31/2008,,"We purchased a new HDTV, and then had to obtain the required HD box from Comcast.  Soon we started hearing an annoying static like clicking sound, that would come and go over time.  After several months, we started hearing it more and more, and on many more channels.  We asked a few other Comcast customers that we knew if they were having this same problem.  When no one was, we thought it was the TV, so contacted the store.  Not being huge TV watchers, and the fact that it didn't happen every day, we tried to ignore it.Finally we called Comcast.  I will say, we have always had a technician respond in a timely and courteous manner, unlike some of the other complaints listed here.  However, we discovered that it was not the TV, but the box that we had been renting each month to receive the HD channels (on an HDTV, go figure).  The tech told us they had problems with these boxes, and replaced it. Problem solved, but we feel that we should not have had to pay for a faulty box over that long of a period of time, especially when Comcast knew they had faulty boxes installed in people's homes.  Shouldn't there have been some kind of recall?  I doubt I will ever be able to resolve this issue, but know that like others, we are also very disgruntled with Comcast. I also have high-speed internet with them, and have noticed ALOT more problems lately.  THere is not a day that goes by now that I am not experiencing some type of problem with the internet - from interrupted service to the blocking of my out-going emails.  When I called to fix the issue, I was told it sounded like a security issue, and that I was suspected of spamming.  Oh, puh-LEASE!  Sending pictures of the kids to grandparents is spamming?  When the tech on the other end of the phone line told me what changes to make in my system, he acted like I should've already known that.  When I asked how I was to know something like that, he said it's on the Comcast website.  Remind me to read it someday when I have a minute . . .

"Gerald of Collierville, TN",3/1/2009,,"Every sunday the Fox News channel goes off the air or is srambled. This occurs every Sunday without fail. I believe an employee who works on Sunday's has an agenda.I pay $134.00 per month for Comcast. Unable to talk to anyone at Comcast about this. The FCC should investigate this problem.This is fraud, we  should certainly get  the channels we pay for."
"Paul of Folsom, CA",3/1/2009,,"For 9 months Comcast double billed me. It was not a large amount, only $6/mo and admittedly I should have spotted it earlier, but when I called it to their attention I was told they could only adjust one month - $6 bucks. They apparently consider the other $48 additional profit since I didnt catch it before the first month. And the customer disservice voice wouldn't even let me speak with a supervisor about it.Does that seem right? It's apparently legal, but its infuriating. I know we are supposed to complain to our local franchise authority (LFA), but Im wondering, does the LFA really give a rats asteroid about consumers? And even if they did, who has bigger teeth, Comcast or some local franchise authority. Wonder what a small claims court outcome would be. Its not as much the $56 as it is the attitude that. we can do whatever we want and theres nothing you can do about it.?Another satisfied customer. Competition can't get here too soon for me."
"Bridget of Colorado Springs, CO",3/2/2009,,"If you send in the rebate they won't give you one because they'll say you didn't put in your order number. Thing is there is no place to put the order number in on the rebate. When I called to tell them this they told me I had to resubmit the request even though I had the number ready for them. So, I'm out of $125. I sure wish I had gone with Quest. Anybody but Comcast would have been better...lost $125 rebate even though I filled it out on time, completely and accurately."
"Norah of Oakland, CA",3/3/2009,,Comcast owes me an overpayment refund of $97.69 since Nov.2008.  I was told that I should wait 3-6 weeks for the refund; In Jan I phoned to a supervisor they said that disconnect hadn't happened until Dec.30th. I called in Feb. and they said disconnect for the service hadn't happened until Feb.3rd. I got a bill on Feb.12th stating installation charges of $97.69 without a check; they told me to ignore the statement; I still don't have the refund.  Can you help I need to pay for a mortgage and pay expenses
"Terri of Germantown, TN",3/3/2009,,"To Whom It May Concern,  I am writing to explain my consumer issue with Comcast.    I have digital cable and high-speed internet through Comcast.  On Feb 10th, I attempted to call about a service outage.  It took me 30 minutes to get through to someone.  I told the representative in Knoxville, TN that I was having problems with my cable service, was there someone I could talk to in Memphis?  I was told no?.  I therefore had to explain my problem to someone that did not service my area and to my knowledge did not really care either.  My problem was: outage, freeze-up of digital picture, poor reception, no I-Control channel. A service call was issued for Feb 13th.  The service technician came and went.  He claimed to have fixed the problem with an adapter device in my attic.  Everything was working until 2 days later.  I put another call into Comcast and I was told that they could not get anyone until Feb 21st.  The service technician came on the 21st of Feb and installed a new box because the old box wasnt working properly.  When he left, everything was working until 3 days later when we lost the quality of our HD programming.  I put ANOTHER call into Comcast.  A technician came out and I was told that the HD signal was out of range.  I told the technician that I did not think it was his fault but that we had been very frustrated with the service.  He gave me his cell phone number to call but when we lost our service entirely after 1 hour, I called and could not get through.  I have been told that this is a tactic used to get out of the house quicker.  After losing both our digital cable and internet all together, I called Comcast again having to remain on the phone for 25 minutes before reaching anyone to tell them that we had no service at all.   In the Memphis area, folks that live in Germantown are not treated with the same courtesy as those in Memphis.  Our services are worse and it takes longer to get things fixed.  It is because there is racial polarity with the two communities.  Given that, I feel we were not only given terrible service by Comcast, but we feel that this was racially motivated.  I do not feel that we should be discriminated against nor do I feel that we will ever get our service repaired.   At the time of this letter, we still do not have our situation resolved.  We also feel that the situation will worsen once this is investigated.  Comcast has spent hours, days trying to fix problems in our area but to no avail.  This had been going for a month. I have a small business, I pay my bills online, etc.  and I cannot do this without my internet service.  I am missing calls to my home because I have Magicjack phone through my computer and it requires broadband.  I cannot keep up with dangerous weather coming nor can I keep informed of news that affects me and my family."
"Patricia of Monmouth Junction, NJ",3/3/2009,,"I was having problems with getting Cable On Demand and a technician came out to resolve the problem on 12-5-08.  After over an hour in my home unable to resolve the problem he went outside and ran what he called a temporary line, which was an orange cable that he ran across the front of my home, which includes my front door. I started calling Comcast Mid December and have been calling them ever since to have them come an run the cable the correct way but they have not done so.  They told me they had to contact the utility companies because they had to mark the area so that they can bury the line, however, they told me this back in December and again in January. The Cable poses a safety hazard as well as being unsightly.  I tripped on the cable about a month ago and my 82 year old dad tripped on the cable last week coming into my home.  The last time I called cable was on 2/26/09 and after waiting on hold for about 45 minutes waiting to speak with a supervisor, he told me someone would come out on Sat 2/28, they never came. I have spent countless hours on the phone with Comcast and I'm at my wits end trying to get this problem resolved and feel helpless and frustrated. I'm hoping you can help me get this problem resolved and look into the way Comcast treats their customers. I'm sure I'm not the first customer that has experienced the run around that Comcast has given me over the last 3 months but I hope it's the last and that Comcast has a higher authority to answer to.  Thank you for any assistance you can give me with this matter.I'm thankful that neither myself nor my dad were hurt when we tripped on the cable, but I don't want to wait for something bad to happen.  I'm extremely stressed over this situation."
"Susan of Pasadena, MD",3/4/2009,,"After waiting a 6 weeks for comcast to set up the home phone in my new house (they had come out earlier, but had not set it up correctly), I got my new phone number in January 2009.  I gave the number to no one, since I use my cell.  I never filled out a form with the phone number.  Only Comcast knows the number and the name that goes with it.  In the past 4 weeks, I have rec'd sales called, repeatedly.  When I called Comcast to complain that they sold my name and number, I asked that I be given a new number that was not sold.  I was told there was a fee to get a new number and there was no way to guarantee that the information would be kept confidential."
"Alon of Sunnyvale, CA",3/5/2009,,"I'm a long time Comcast customer and have had many and repeated problems with them.  My patience has finally ran out.   A few weeks ago I moved to a new address with my brother. I cancelled my old Comcast account and joined his. We decided to expand our cable package and add a second TV.   We called Comcast and explained what we wanted to do. They said we would need two new cable boxes and that they would send them by mail and we could install them ourselves with help over the phone.  The boxes dully arrived.  We installed one. The second, for the new location, did not work. We called Comcast. Now we were told something completely different: that that location had never had cable hooked up before and therefore a technician would need to come out and make the necessary connections.  Needless to say, no one mentioned this when we first ordered the extended service and Comcast could offer no explanation why.  We managed to get an appointment for about two weeks later. A duly tech. arrived.  It turned out he would have to get into the crawl space under the house.  As this is a standard procedure for Comcast you would think they would be prepared. But he wasn't, and furthermore, he was too big to get into the crawl space. He said we would need to set up another appointment with a different tech. who could get into our crawl space.  We called Comcast again. The earliest appointment they had was three weeks later, March 5, today.  I waited  patiently for today. I cancelled all my plans to be here. Then I waited all morning. No tech!  We called Comcast and were told they didn't have any appointment for us in the system.    We asked to speak to a supervisor. we asked that a new appointment be rushed through. they refused to budge. The earliest we could get another appointment is at least two weeks from now, by which time it will be nearly two months since this whole thing started.  I've had enough of Comcast.  There must be better options out there."
"Brenda of Seattle, WA",3/5/2009,,"I have used the bundled services from this company for over a year and have the following cautions. 1.  If a consumer has any inkling that they will be moving for any reason, DO NOT USE SUBSCRIBE to the email or telephone service.  Comcast has absolutely no way to allow you to use these services if you are not in their service area.  Since I am moving, I will now have to move my phone service yet again to another provider so that I can retain my phone number.  I will be unable in any way shape or form to retain my email address and would never have changed everything to them if I had known that they have no way of allowing me to subscribe to the email service without physically being in their service area and having their piece of equipment. Most other companies that provide email services have figured out how to allow customers to retain their address and have been able to charge for this service. This just adds one more stress to a move and will be very disruptive to my business. 2.  I converted to Digital Cable and have had nothing but problems with receiving cable on the auxiliary or small box.  They told me that it would provide me with the same quality and access to channels that I had before converting.  This is not the case.  Over 25% of the stations that I had before now come up with Service has been interrupted.  The rest have problems with both the audio and video cutting in and out. After numerous calls to Comcast to get the box reset, new signals sent, etc. I am still in the same position.  The full box works just fine. 3.  The staff at the call centers has definately moved down the scale in the politeness and helpfulness categories.  They used to be eager to assist. Now they are argumentative and extremely defensive.  Is there some new training being given them to teach them how to do this or is this company degenrating to the service level of many of the ones who have placed their call centers outside of the USA?  Their staff is certainly acting like they don't care about their customers any longer. "
"Teresa of Colver, PA",3/6/2009,,"I am writing to complain about the poor programing on cable TV.  Everything on every station is a rerun. In the last year some of the stations offered in the digital package have played the same movie over and over again as a feature film for a year.  Comcast is charging far too much money for all of these channels and the programming is horrid.  I quite HBO due to the poor programing.  Since one cannot pick the stations they want to subscribe to, you have to purchase the full package.  In the last year the programing has been outrageously horrible.  Consumers are truely being overcharged.Overcharging for poor channel programing.  Comcast and the other digital providers need to address this with the programers."
"Bill of Bedford, NH",3/6/2009,,"Set up to get bundle package and was told by customer service that I would get the same channels.  Tech came to the house but Comcast had not set aside the correct amount of time to trunk over the phone line from Fairpoint, so they gave me a temporary phone number This was incorrect procedure, so they had to cancel my current work order and initiate a NEW work order, thus making me wait 9 more days.  The tech unhooked everything and did notre-establish the phone line in our bedroom, plus we now didn't have The Movie Channel. I called and they kept mtransferring me to the phone tech who told me I would have to wait until my appointment. They showed up in the AFTERNOON, even though I specifically took time off work in the am, so had to RE-SCHEDULE again.  When all iis said and done, I was told The Movie Channel WAS NOT part of the package.  When i complained, the customer service rep REFUSED to let me speak to a superior and I was hung up on TWICE. THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR POOR SERVICE. Once I get Fios in my neighborhood, I will switch and be done with Comcast for good.Missed 2 days work"
"Alexandria of Memphis, TN",3/7/2009,,"I was once a customer of comcast cable, and I had a problem with my bill being two to four hundreds a months.  Well I fail to notice that I had comcast internet service on it.  I contacted comcast to talk to one of their customer service reps.  She must had had a real bad night, she talked to me like I was something that she had just stepped on.  I cancel my service with them, and went to dish net for my cable service. now this is my beleif is  Comcast has the contract in these apts. and to keep anyone else from using dish, we can not put our dish on the balcony.  Sounds like a kick-back to me, I feel like it's wrong and so do alot of tenant.  I shouldn't have to made to watch a networt that is not worth a D.I talked to the apt. managers, and tried to contact the companies home office, and I they never return my telephone call.

"R of Eugene, OR",3/8/2009,,"I recently upgraded my internet service with Comcast to there 12 MBPS offering from their dumbed down 1 MBPS service.   For a week now I have tried to have them show me proof that I am actually getting 12 MBPS.  Consistently for the last week, various speeed tests that I have performed on multiple web sites have never produced a download speed greater than 960 KBPS.  Comcast reps consistently state that I have the 12 MBPS service but always avoid the question when I ask for proof.  I examined all the hardware, checked the connections, I am using there modem, so that is not an issue. They installed the lines just over a year ago, the computers get higher donwload speeds at other locations (non Comcast).    I think they are scamming people by selling a service that they are not actually offering.  Selling 12 MBPS when they are only supplying 1 MBPS is wrong.  They should be penalized for this business practice if in fact this is what they are doing and should have to reimburse if they have been deceitful in there practices.  I am requesting more comments and investigation into there practices...   Major waste of time, performance of my system.  There is no physical damage and the economic damage is somewhat intangible.  Maybe this is why they get away with it, because they know that the complaint process is cumbersome and most will acquiesce before going to the trouble."
"Ashutosh of Somerset, NJ",3/8/2009,,"I am facing some issues with Comcast. I started their bundle services from July 2008 at $59.99. After some time the voice quality on the phone was very bad. It has frequent drop calls and sometimes the numbers are not getting dialed also. As a result i want to get it disconnected. When i called Comcast Customer Service, I was told that i cannot do that-if i do i need to pay the same price($59.99) for my comcast internet and that will be a lower speed internet(1X). Right now i m using double bundle with the comcast modem and the monthly bill comes out to be around $70.00  So is it okay that they charge $59.99 for the lower speed internet? I am asking to disconnect the phone which is having a lot of issues.  My next door neighbor is just using the comcast high speed internet and paying only $24.95. When i compared my speed via speed test, he is having the same speed that i am getting. So here Comcast is fooling people-I am getting the 1X speed even when they it's 6X. When i told comcast customer service that this option is available to have only high speed internet rather than both the services, they turned down my request for that also. They say we don't have that promotion now and i have to pay $59.99 even if i just use the so called High speed internet from Comcast. It's irony that everytime i call customer service I get different answers. Whatever they commit on the phone call, they are not ready to follow after a day itself. Very bad experience till now.My monthly bill from Comcast comes out to be around $70(with a lot of taxes etc..). On top of it because of this bad comcast phone, I need to buy a cell phone which I need to pay around $74 per month. I should have been paying only $24.95 with taxes it comes out to be around $28. So every month I am paying an additional $42.00 more for a lousy phone service."
"Laurie of Brighton, CO",3/8/2009,,"Arnold is but one of a few poorly trained service representatives we have had to deal with in our relationship with Comcast Cable.  We switched to their high-speed broadband Internet service about two years ago. Things were fine until about six months ago when the modum (leased from Comcast) died.  Since then we have had to replace the modem twice and had a new cable hooked up to the house by various technician.  The latest modem (#3) died a few days ago. I called their Customer Service and they tried to fix it over the phone and finally said we had no connection. We had two options.  A technician could come and fix the problem or we could unhook the modem and take it to a Comcast payment center and have it replaced at no charge.  We went to the payment center and Arnold gave us a different modem.  I asked if it was new and he said it was a refurbished one from their warehouse. I also told him this was the third modem we had in six months.  His reply was that he had also had problems with his modem from Comcast and when he switched to their phone service, no more problems. We tried to hook up the new modem and power cord.  Comcast said to call them after we hooked it up.  We got no signal, so we called.  We talked to a very nice CSR named Tanya.  After several minutes she found out the reason we had no signal, noone had scanned our current modem into their system.  She took the time to do this.  I also found out that the servic call in which Comcast had installed a new cable to our house (which was supposed to be done at no charge per the technician who did the work) had been charged to our bill.  This work was done in January.  We did not receive a statment from Comcast in February.  When we did receive the March statement it had a $27 service call and also a late fee of @$6 added onto to our bill.  Tanya said we shouldn't have been charged for the service call and waived it.  She also waived the late fee and we had always paid our bill on time in the past.  We now have a working modem (for how long, who knows). I took the old power cord back the Arnold at the payment center.  He said I noticed that you had a service call and late payment waived from your account.  He said, See, we are working for you.  I told him we also had to wait for the new modem to be scanned into the system before it could be activated and the only reason the other items were waived is because we called and pointed it out to Comcast.  Arnold said, Have a nice day! Are we fortunate to pay Comcast $60/month for this frustration and lousy service.Each time we have had to contact Comcast, it takes us 2-3 including the wait for either a technician or CSR (who usually speaks English as a second language, which is hard to understand)to try and take care of the problem.  We don't get any monetary compensation from Comcast for the time we spend fixing their problems.  If we have any other problem, we will be switching to another company.  Unfortunately, their service will probably be the same.  So sad for the American consumer.  A sign of the times."
"Paul of Darien, IL",3/11/2009,,"The modem for my internet and home phone use went dead. Replacement for this modem Must be done by a technician  and cannot be scheduled for 5 days.

"Pat of Marshfield, MA",3/11/2009,,"I have been in the process of filing a loss claim against Comcast for nearly a month now. I downloaded their McAfee Security Suite that they offer to high speed internet customers. Along with crashing my hard drive and fracturing my registry, I lost my computer for 10 days. I had a Comcast tech come out to the house and within 2 minutes proved to me that it was not a Comcast issue, but my computer was trashed. I got on the phone with Comcast the day I got my computer back, and told them that a product that they are offering on their website caused my computer to fail. I told them that I felt that the $250 to repair my computer should be given back to me. The woman agreed and told me that the Claims Division will get to me within 72 hours. The claims person, John, did get back to me, and asked me to fax him the copy of my invoice for my repair. I also wrote him a statement of facts as a timeline so he could see what happened. I wrote on my cover letter, Please call me to let me know that you have received all pages in good order. I never received a phone call back. While trying to get in touch with him again, Comcast is unable to give a direct number to their Claims Department. In fact, I can't find anything online or over the phone for it. I sent the same faxes again, only this time, I made the Call me back statement huge and bold. Again, I never received a call. I had to go out of my way to my local Comcast office, and pleaded with the person to give me John and his supervisor's email address so I could get in touch with them. He does it, and wouldn't you know, the email address is inter-office only and doesn't allow outside email addresses in. Today, I sent a fax in 56 point font saying, Would John or Julie please call me at the number listed below. Guess what, no phone call today. I am at the point where I think that legal action is my only resort. Their complete lack of customer service is horrendous. I'm not asking them to put a man on the moon, I'm asking them to call me back and let me know that they received my faxes. Claims like this always seem to be lost or we never received it. My next move tomorrow is to call and cancel my service. Maybe then I will get an answer.$250 for repairing my laptop. 10 days of no computer, and no ability to keep an update of my work status (Union worker) Too many hours on the phone or online trying to get somebody to answer my simple questions, only to get re-routed to another generic 1-800-COMCAST phone number that says the same things to me that I've already heard 5 times that day."
"Iris of Bremerton, WA",3/11/2009,,I cancelled my HBO service and was charged a $1.99 to process my cancellation! Since when do we get charged to get rid of a service?  As consumers if we decide that we don't want a service we have that option to cancel and not be charged for it.
"Patricia of Rehoboth, MA",3/13/2009,,"I have been unable to get into my email so I contacted comcast only to find out that a few days before they were tying to do an up grade in their smartzone(email) and apparantly something went wrong and now a lot of customers, like myself ares having problems getting in. When I contacted comcast, Which has been 3 days in a row now. First day I was told about the problem and we went through a walk around. It now takes me three steps and at least 3 tried to get into my email. The Second day, I was walked through a delete process of deleting several items, Then in the middle of restarting, everything went dead and I was totally disconnect and I had to call back. The Second indvidual did the same thing the first one did. Only this time he did give ne a ticket number. He also told me that he was hopeful that this will clear up in a few days. How's that for customer. I am paying good money for what is suppose to be a fast service and they can not get it correct. And per this individual I spoke with it has now been just about a week and the problem is still not cleared. Paying for a service that I am not getting. I count on my emails to keep in touch with my family that is out of state. Comcast is selling a sevice that they are not providing and are not compensating customers when they make mistakes. "
"Nicholas of Eden Prairie, MN",3/13/2009,,"Comcast and FSN continually misrepresent which hockey games are going to be on the HD channel. It seems more often than not they say it will be presentedin HD but the channel is just gray screen. I have tried sending e-mails to the company I never get a response.I plan to have company to watch a game in HD which is a service we pay extra for, people show up and its not in HD. Embarrasing and a clear waste of money, we pay to see hockey in HD and we never get to. Comcast sucks!"
"Chris of Pompano Beach, FL",3/14/2009,,"An installer arrived at my residence at about 2:15pm and attempted to gain entry.  I was not home, but my wife and child were.  My wife was not comfortable letting him in without me there, and she asked me to call Comcast to find out why he was there so early.  After talking with Comcast, a rep told me that she had talked with the dispatcher and the dispatcher instructed him to either wait until the scheduled appointment time, or come back during the scheduled appointment time.  I thanked her.  I get a call about 10 minutes later from my wife saying that the installer did not leave and was knocking on the door again.  I instructed her not to answer, and she told me she was getting scared because he keeps knocking every couple of seconds, and he is knocking really hard like he is angry.  I told my wife to take our son to our bedroom and lock the door.  I instructed her to call the police if she thinks he is going to break in.  I called Comcast again, and explained what was happening.  I asked them to contact the installer and tell him to stop.  My wife on the other line said that she thinks he finally stopped, but was too scared to go downstairs to check.  I came home to find that the installer had left, however I told the Comcast rep, that under no circumstances do I want this installer on my property, and that if they can't get someone else out there today, to reschedule.  I am extremely upset about this.  I know why appointments are made.  If I set an appointment that I cannot make, I contact the other party to reschedule.  I don't show up outside of the scheduled time frame and bang on the door until someone answers.  According to my wife, the installer was very rude and had an aggressive posture when she initially answered the door (only poking her head out).  He rudely told her he had been waiting outside and calling her for over 45 minutes.  We have a gated entrance and I was never called to allow his entry so she was initially confused on he gained access to the property.  He stated he is going to his truck to get equipment, and she closed and locked the door.  She then called him at a number she thought he tried to reach her from and asked him to please wait until I got home.  He then asks her where I am.  It is none of his business where I am and my wife is smart enough to know not to tell a strange man how far away from home I am.  Then he came back to our door trying to gain entry again.  This is unacceptable.  This is not the behavior we expect from a professional company like Comcast.  I realize that this man may be an independent contractor and not an employee of Comcast.  I hope you realize that men like this represent your company poorly and forced us to reconsider acquiring your services.  I would like to be informed in a timely manner of the action you take with this individual, as well as what you plan to do to reconcile with us as your client.  My wife and son were visibly shaken by this incident and my wife and 7 year old jumped when my sister knocked on the door to pick them up this afternoon.

"Matt of Hobe Sound, FL",3/14/2009,,"I have had Comcast Service for 5 months now. We started with back signal issues, had to take the afternoon off from work to wait on tech. After two time I told them to just run a new feed from the road. They did that and it worked fine until it was covered. I called for service again, had them come after my work this time. The tech said everything was fine. The picture continued to freeze and break-up for a few weeks and one day the box was off with no clock nothing. Called Comcast and got it going again, this happened 3 more times until I asked to have the box changed. I drove 20 min to the service center to change the box out, got it home and it would not work. Called Comcast and got this one going, service center never activated the box. Box worked for 2 days and went blank, called Comcast to get box going, 2 days later remote would not control the box, back-up remote would not control the box. Called Comcast and they could not get it going, Had to take the box 20 min back to the service center. Lady at the service center could not give me a diffrent box, so I asked to have just the Cable TV service cancelled. I get home and find the whole thing was cancelled, my internet also. Called Comcast to get it going again to find out the lady at the service center cancelled my whole account. At that point I told them to just leave it and I will go elsewere. I have about 6 hrs of phone time and 3 hrs of drive time invested in this whole mess with Comcast, so they siad they would credit me $45.00. Ok, I later was checking the bill and figured the the bill was just paid and the $45.00 was what they have to credit me back for unussed service. This company really needs to look into finding some new employees, In theese times it should be very easy to find quality people. I am working on changeing over to DirecTv. I hope not to be back here typeing. 6 Hrs of time spent on the phone, 3 hrs of drive time changing out boxes"
"James of Cordova, TN",3/15/2009,,"Comcast ran advertisements saying if you bundle your internet, phone and cable services you will save money. I was quoted a price of $150.00 by Comcat. I was paying 67.00 to ATT and 107.00 to Comcast. Instaed of my cost going down my cost are greater because Comcast is charging me 70.00 for digital voice that I did not ask for and installation fees for digital voice. The issues were answered by J. Taylor by justifying the fees and not adjusting or addressing the unwarranted fees. Also, I aclled to cancell before I made the switch and Comcast convinced me not to cancel  by promising to provide additional receivers at no cost because the satelitte company had quted me a prive the same as Comcast with 6 receivers. If Comcast has done this to me I am sure they have done this to others."
"Ellen of Pleasanton, CA",3/16/2009,,"I have had a contract for Highspeed Internet service with Comcast for 5 years. The price for that service has remained constant @ $46.21 a month. About 2 months ago Comcast sent me a notice saying they were charging me the wrong price for my service and would be making changes. I don't remember verbetum what the letter said, but it did say that if I was willing to add Television and Phone to my service package I could get a reduced price on the Highspeed internet. When I got my new bill, not only did my rate go up, but the megabyte per second speed went down to 4mbps from 6mbps. Plus, they prorated me for half a month?! I believe there are some unfair pricing practices going on. I feel like I am essentially being blackmailed into using Comcast's TV & Phone coverage just to keep a decent price for Highspeed Internet service. I think that Comcast is taking advantage of their monopoly on the Cable access to my community."
"Emily of Memphis, TN",3/16/2009,,"I have had more problems with comcast that I could possibly be able to share. One time it took them 4 service calls 12 technicians and over a month to hook up our cable box. They kept telling us that we would have to pay extra to hire a small technician to fit under our house. After all of this hassle, we ended up calling a company who came over and did it in about 20 minutes. Our cable is CONSTANTLY interrupted. I am not able to use satelite b/c we have too many trees.... How is this not a classic monopoly? The rates that they have advertised on their website are about $80 lower than what we pay, when i called to ask about this, they said that unfortunately my area wasn't involved in this deal and offered me another package that cost more. "
"Robert of Lake Oswego, OR",3/17/2009,,"I signed up for internet and phone service last October(2008) on a promotional that was represented by salesperson as one price for life package. I have copy of signed order form with the price for life written in and now Comcast wants to renege on the package we purchased in good faith.I canceled my existing phone service and internet at the time and went with Comcast to save money.  Based on the package program cost on my current bill,they wish to charge me an additional $32.91 plus associated tax more per month beginning mid April."
"Pat of Marshfield, MA",3/18/2009,,"This is a follow up to my recent post.  After speaking to the head supervisor who was handling my case, she stated that they never received any of my faxes.  I told her that I found that very hard to believe.    I had verified that the fax number in fact was correct, and we managed to speak on a few occasions.  She was up front with me that she was in the phone and TV end of Comcast, but that she would discuss my problems with those in the internet department.  I got a phone call from her today, as she had promised.  She informed me that they were putting a $250 credit onto my account.  At least this was handled the right way, and they didn't offer me 18 months of a pay channel that I don't watch anyway.   Overall, once I put my foot down, which included a 30 day letter of demand from the Massachusetts General Law section, I ultimately got what I wanted, which was for Comcast to pay for my laptop. "
"M of Suwanee, GA",3/18/2009,,"I received a call(3/18/2009) from the Comcast equipment department saying I still had equpment for them I had already returned in July 2008.  I moved from that location over 9 months ago and I am not sure I can find the receipt.  I called the customer service office to find out why I was on this list.  Allan, a Customer Service rep answered the phone, he was very rude,did not want to help to look up my information.  I told him I wanted to speak to a supervisor and he then put me on hold for over 5 mins.  When he came back and I asked him why I was not transfered to someone else, he said was looking for the phone number for the corporate office as I requested.  I told him I did not ask for any such information,  I asked why he was being so rude and if he did not want to help me he could have just transfered me to someone else.  He said to do that, I would have to hang up and call back.  I told him he was not being very he rude about this incident.  He said he was the best Rep they had there.  I beg to differ, left that call not getting any assistance.I had to call back to speak with another Customer Service rep, who was very helpful, looked up the information on my account and saw I owed no equipment, she made a notation on my past account and advised me to call the Equipment Department to let them know of that I was not liable for any information.  I did that.  Why couldn't it be that easy with my inital call, I wasted 30 mins of my life and had to make additional calls for information I should have received in the first place."
"Marie of Pittsburgh, PA",3/18/2009,,"The problems with Comcast started when I bought my new HD TV.  I called to have a new HD box put in.  They gave me the 3 hour window, between 4 and 7.  7 came and went, afer numerous calls, they gracisouly gave me a $5 credit for my inconvenience.  At 11:15, over 4 hours late, the tech called and said he was turning on my street, did I want to reschedule  After trying 3 boxes he relized he was in an area where a different box was used.  Finally the tv was hooked up.  The time was nearly 1 am!A few days later we went to watch a movie on the DVD only to discover that he didn't hook it back up.  HAd tech out again, he hooked it up.  Go to watch the movie, but the audio was in the wrong place.  Again, another Tech to come, as some of the HD channels were not working either.  August, got a bill with Adult pay per view movies on, which we did not watch.  Called and they had me put a Pin on.  Was assured this would not happen again.  I am the only one with the Pin.  This Past Monday I receive the lastes bill and again there were Adult movies.  9 total.  I immediately called and explained my dilemma.  The worst part is when 5 of the movies were ordered, my family was out of state visitng my daughter at Fort Dix before she left for Iraq.  A tech was sent out to do a diagnostic on the boxes and it showed that NO PAY PER VIEW MOVIES WERE ORDERED.  Yet even after that, they refuse to remove over $100 in charges.  I have emailed my local consumer reporters and filed a complaint with the BBB and also an email to the President of  consumer affairs for Comcast.  "
"Anibal of Marlton, NJ",3/20/2009,,"To save money I cancelled the Comcast internet service. Instead of my bill going down $45 dollars it went up $50. They told me that my price went up because I cancelled one of the services. If I want my bill to go down I need to have, cable, internet and phone provided by them. In some places this is called black mail.I need cable for my work, I'm self employed, I don't know for how long I can afford this. Without same cable programs I can't do a proper job."
"Amalia of Bothell, WA",3/20/2009,,"For the past five years I have signed up for the basic cable services and was able to view a lot more limited channels . As of 3/10/09 they have cut down the channels to 2-13 without any notice or notification. I have called and they told me that my area was audited and the mistake was corrected. In order to view those channels I will need to get a digital device which is $55 plus, I will need to upgrade my services to receive those basic channels which is around $50 a month. They must really be hurting for businnes. If I would have known this I would of ordered a converter box to receive the basic channels for free. I am outraged of how they treat there customers. "
"Barbara of Glenn Dale, MD",3/20/2009,,A technician came on my property on either the 3rd or 4th of March and I assume to do some repair work and had to dig in the front of my house. I called that evening after finding this out and made a complaint because in the process of helping a customer or establishing service(I am not a comcast customer)he did not place the boards that I had as a border for guest parking back where he found it and did not pat the dirt back which created an area that holds water when it rains. I explained that the digging part was not a problem but not putting things back the way they found it was. I was told that someone would contact me within 24 hours and I am still waiting for results.
"Christa of Boynton Beach, FL",3/21/2009,,"I called comcast on Feb 10, 2009 to see if I could get a chaaper pkg deal from them. My bill was running 195.00 a month for cable and internet + taxes and fees. I ended up cxl my cable TV with Comcast after I was told there was nothing they could offer me to reduce my monthly bill. I have noticed since then that my Internet has been acting funny, sometimes good connection, sometimes low and it seems much slower. I just received my new monthly bill and of course it is wrong! I called comcast to inquire why my internet service went from 47.95 + taxes and fees to 88.63 on my bill. I spoke with Charlotte who informed me that my I had billing errors. DUH! Well come to find out comcast never informed me that my internet chges would change when I dropped my cable TV. My bill went up from 47.95 to 64.95 plus fees. What a rip off!! I was trying to SAVE money. I really feel like this is wrong! Why is comcast allowed to do this? I asked for the office of the President and was told they could not give out that # to consumers, but they would transfer me. I was prompted to leave a message. How very FRUSTRATING! "
"Debra of Staunton, VA",3/22/2009,,"I am making a formal complaint against comcast cable.I had my cable installed April 2008. When I received my April bill I had charges against my bill for pay preview movies that i did not purchased, so I call Comcast and discussed this with them. they told me they would remove all charges that has not beeen removed. They are saying that April till September movies where ordered every two minutes apart. I did not order these movies and they need to be removed from my bill. By them not removing these charges as they told me in the beginning I would not be having the problems I am having now one day my cable is on the next day its off and i call everytime they tell me they will get everything squared away and the cable will be left on. its on now not sure when or if it will be cut off again.Every time I call I never get the same person or a supervisior. They never have a supervisior available.They sent me 3 bills in Jan.2008 and I called to see which bilol I needed to pay they did not know. They would call me back Never a reponse or nothing just more bills."
"Melinda of Spring Valley, IL",3/23/2009,,We have called to ask for showtime to be taken off for 6 months. When we call they tell me it is only 5.00. I tell them I still want it taken off and that it is 14.00. I still have showtime. I go to the office and she says okay i took it off for this month and it was only 5.00 the month before. I ask for a print out of my bill and it is 14.00. They shut my cable off the day before the superbowl last year for not paying next months bill. So i did not have cable for  days I think I should get paid for that too. I have had many other mistakes on my bill and thy tell me that I pay or they will shut off my service and take me to collections. I have to have comcast cable that i don't watch to get the internet  to be able to do my homework. I am in college and have to have the internet and in this small town must got through them they over bill me and shut my internet off and it is effecting my grades. How am i gonna get a good grade when I cam not get online to site my reports. Thanks for dooming my schooling Comcast.I am out at least a 100.00 by now and hours of phone time. I also had trouble in college due to all of the trouble with the cable company I lost internet and some of my college courses are online.
"Anita of Boulder, CO",3/24/2009,,"Despite numerous calls for many years, we continue to have interruptions in services.  Comcast does not seem to be able to fix this.  We live in the city proper.  Every service person who comes out has a different story.  People have arrived on our property unannounced without identifying themselves.    They also gave out my unlisted phone number to a telemarketing firm that worked for them and then denied it, even when I explained that there were very grave circumstances that required my number not be published or shared.  While I was recovering from surgery, I was plagued with these calls. Despite numerous calls to COMCAST this was not addressed.  They continue to substitute my broadband number for my land line number in spite of my requests not to do so.   Last week they came out to perform service and left the front door open in below 50 degree weather.  There was no need for this.  They let my pet who is on medication and elderly escape.  The supervisor said we should have told them that we had a pet.  We had to search for our pet and eventually found her.  The supervisor projected an attitude, complained that he had to come out on a Saturday, and also told us we should keep all the records of service calls since he had nothing beyond 30 days.  Their service is very poor and they always have an excuse.Infliction of emotional harm, hundreds of hours reporting problems and waiting for service people and explaining the problems all over again."
"Rick of Marietta, GA",3/24/2009,,"COMCAST has the worst Customer Service of any company I know. You go on their web site an can only find how to buy stuff, not information about their services, their programming, or even a contact to complain to... I have tried to find out what Basketball games would be televised in my area and can't find anyone who knows. I did find one customer service rep who talked to everyone she knew within COMCAST and could not find an answery so she called ESPN. Horay!!! but they didn't know what COMCAST would televise in my are only that they were broadcasting it. When you can get someone to come out to fix a problem they quote we will be there sometime between 8AM & 5PM, so you take the day off an they don't arrive until 6PM to tell you they can't fix it but you will be on the Top of their list the next day????? Why not today????"
"Alpesh of San Jose, CA",3/25/2009,,The comcast claims to provide a very high speed internet service. I have purchased their 12Mbs internet service package. I have also purchased their triple play service which is the most expensive service. I am their high paying customer. I don't mind paying high monthly fees as long as I get quality of service.  Lately comcast internet speed is very slow. I tried to call the customer service and they didn't help at all. I kept on calling multiple times and problem hasn't been resolved.  They claim to provide highest internet speed. All their commercial focuses on speed.  I am getting 54kbs internet speed. I am paying for 12Mbs. Their customer support was unable to help. I plan to switch to other internet service provider. It is painful to switch service to other provider and waste of my time and money. I have to do this but wanted to file complain for comcast so other people dont' suffer.  
"Bonita of Wilmington, DE",3/25/2009,,"Couple years back,I restored my service and talked with a Customer Service tech about what is now call On Demand, digital  Video Recorder. and gave my Idea exactly what is now taking place and the rep mention he would give this information to his company and maybe in couple years we may have this in the working.  Now this is call on Demand, Digital Video Recorder. Can I get any Royalties since this was my idea? This was a conversation over the phone."
"Jeff of Bethesda, MD",3/25/2009,,"For the third residence in a row, comcast failed to mail me now the second monthly statement(not in a row)  Then the next month they send me a statement with late with the previous month's balance w/late fees + this months balance...about twice what I pay.  Every time I call they say that it was sent out and they are sorry and there is nothing I can do.  This is clearly a mistake worked into their system that most people won't pick up on.  They say since service was going on, which is on again off again at best, they still charge.  How can I be expected to pay my bill on time when they do not send it and then hit me with a bill that is more then double what I normally payIn this economic turbulence, this is how comcast is handling it.  They send you a bill late so late fees are automatic and they skip months to send bills to charge more money then they would normally get.  I cannot afford this bill now.  This is an almost $400 cable bill which is outrageous.  I have always payed my bills on time but I cannot do that when I don't have a bill to pay...With the economy the way it is and people struggling financially, it makes me sick to see a huge company taking advantage of it's members like this."
"Cheryl of Burlington, CT",3/25/2009,,"We had Comcast Digital Cable in the past and used AT&T for telephone and internet.  Due to the cost of services, we decided to bundle our utilities.  Two hours following the installation (which is another issue itself) we had no dial tone, no line.  Without cell phone service in our area, the only form of communication was through our internet service by way of chatting with a technician.  We were able to reset the modem and regained service.    The following day, we lost our service again.  We went through the same process, yet this time, they were unable to just reset the modem.  It took about an hour and a half to chat with the technician  who was belittling and unable to answer our questions.  We asked to speak with a superviser and were completely given the runaround.  We were told that a technician would need to come to our house, and the first available was three days later.  This was clearly unacceptable, as we have two small children in our home and no emergency service.    After going round and round (and in the process, the line coming back) we spoke with a supervisor in Texas who did very little for us.  A technician was sent out and they replaced equipment.  The telephone service was tested and the technician left our home.    Although our telephone service was working, we now had lost internet.  Another phone call to comcast and two hours later, we had all utilities.  Now this morning, we have no telephone service.  It had been one week of repairing the issue and are now in the same position we were in three weeks ago.    We have taken off time from work and are continuing to pay for a service that is completely unreliable.  What makes matters even worse is that there is no one that will listen to us.  When asked for higher up we are referred to the 1.800 number or chat.  Its unacceptable.Loss of work waiting for technician"
"Sandra of Plainfield, IL",3/26/2009,,"I am tired of Comcast. I work from home as an independent contractor and usually work between 11pm and 3am. Six times in a row now my phone has went dead and my internet connection dropped in the middle of my shift. I called comcast today and they told me it was due to service maintenance and would occur on a regular basis - normally late at night (during my work shift). This is unacceptable to me! I have used other internet and phone service providers who have NEVER caused any service interruptions due to maintenance. They either need to lower my payments for my service or figure out how other companies do their maintenance without causing these interruptions! It's not like the service goes down for only 10 minutes - it takes hours!Since this is occurring during my work hours, it is causing me to lose money and also causing my managers to think of me as being unreliable. If it happens again, I may just be out of a job and who needs that right now during this recession?"
"Sandy of Boynton Beach, FL",3/26/2009,,"my bill went from $90.88 from 10/07/08,changed in March 09 to $87.55 and then in April 2009 became $139.33 for the same service. For one 1yr contact was $19.99 for phone service, digal pkage $24.95 for one yr.,internet service $24.95, modem $5.00 each month and you never pay it out? The modem from AT&T you pay for, and this goes forever? They told me that Basic cable is channels 2-20? I had basic cable and it was till channel 45??? I need to reduse this bill I can't afford this bill? I need to reduce my bill or look for another alternative. This is purely taken avanatage of the comsumer."
"Jason of Arlington, WA",3/27/2009,,"   I have been working for Comcast for almost 7 years and due to the decline of the economy, feel my job was being pushed out the door and finding a way to terminate/fire me for my longtime employment. Back in August 2008, hit a deer on I-90 near Ritzville, WA which has been documented by the ""Washington State Patrol"" of which came out to the scene of where the accident took place and low and behold finding gasoline pouring out of the gas tank of the vehicle, which posed a safety hazard. Keep in mind my partner and I were coming back from our 2 week vacation, which during this time called my employer to let them know the status of where I was at, since I was out of vacation and flex time.This being said 4 days later while the car was in the shop returned to work the following Tuesday of that next week and was put on a written for attendance, which months later after filled out a employee appraisal of my supe on Graveyard, a week later I was called in the office with my reporting supervisor and her boss in reference to what they considered a ""Moment of misery"" as they say, which moved me over to a final written. Just this last week, called on the carpet again the week of the 16th-20th of March which we both listened to the call and confirmed one call was a moment of misery which I am not doubting, however I was also accused of recording my customer calls that I received in the call center, which I never did or would. The other call was a situation where my new boss working day shift stated it was a basic, instead submitted the call anyway which turned out to be another ""Moment of Misery"" call which as of 03/23/2009 was terminated for ""Comcast Customer Interaction Policy"" & ""Code of Conduct.""This being said 4 days later while the car was in the shop returned to work the following Tuesday of that next week and was put on a written for attendance, which months later after filled out a employee appraisal of my supe on Graveyard, a week later I was called in the office with my reporting supervisor and her boss in reference to what they considered a ""Moment of misery"" as they say, which moved me over to a final written.

"William of Reading, PA",3/28/2009,,"Comcast Rewards Triple Play offered me a $4.99 movie credit.  I was unable to download the form and mail it to Comcast, so I contacted their customer service department, and was told on the phone by the male representative that he would look into why I was unable to download the form, and send me an email.  I never received the email and now the form is no longer on the website.  I was told that the movie credit was offered to me as a bonus for the services that I receive at Comcast.    Please look into this matter for me and thank you in advance."
"Burton of San Francisco, CA",3/28/2009,,"I've used comcast for internet and have had poor results with the service.I had to buy a new modem so that it would work. Now I've terminated their service and they want the original modem back or they will charge me an additional $40. Since the modem did not perform well(freeze up) and they demand it to be returned, it makes me think that the modem that failed was a used one to start with. They refused the replacement that was working perfectly. "
"Pieter of Kent, WA",3/28/2009,,"Comcast has completely bungled the conversion to digital service. The failed to adequately communicate to customers that ALL cable customers need to get digital conversion boxes and that they would provide two for free. Instead they led customers to believe that unless they had no cable service and were receiving signals over the air that they needed to do nothing. We became aware of the need to order their cable boxes when they started dropping channels from analog transmittal. We promptly ordered boxes which were delivered quickly but required customer installation and activation by phone. I have called their service center four times over the course of the last 5 days to try to get cable boxes activated. I spoke to a supervisor the last time to no avail. They all asked me exactly the same questions and put me through the same paces bouncing from one set to the next (at opposite ends of our home). I have now done exactly the same thing four times with the same result. No activation. After being put on hold for the third time, and for a total of 40 minutes I hung up and tried live chat. I quickly saw that that was going to get me nowhere so I ended the chat session. The tech. (Mario) stayed on to check on the health of the account and he informed me that we had a balance due. However, Comcast has been withdrawing money from our primary checking account on a monthly basis for years and we just paid the latest bill last week. I am absolutely flabbergasted that this company can have such poor service that it requires its customers to install its own equipment, then spend hour after hour on the phone trying to get the equipment to work. And then...their technicians insinuate that the problem is mine because I haven't paid my bill. Unmitigated gall and arrogance. Absolutely unbelievable. I sincerely hope that this company fails due to lack of customer service. "
"Judith of Atwater, CA",3/29/2009,,"I'm a 15-yr. Comcast customer, no disconnections ever. In Dec. 2008 due to a very large cut in my income, I called Comcast to switch from the $54/mo. plan to the $18/mo. plan. The last thing I got from Comcast was my statement/past due notice dated Feb. 25 for $146 (which I believe is an overcharge but I can't find my old statements). In early March I made an online payment of $62. On March 14 a Comcast serviceman came to my front door and spoke with my son (I'm deaf and don't deal with people at the door). He wanted $25 to avoid disconnection. I refused because I had not heard anything from Comcast and he was not driving a Comcast truck. Then he said he would take $52rt (five dollars!) which sounded suspicious. I wouldn't pay because he did not give us any papers showing a pending disconnection, and since I already made a payment for this month, I thought I was safe. A week went by and I heard nothing from Comcast. Then on Sat. March 21 while I was away, the same Comcast serviceman disconnected my cable service. He said he knocked on the door but nobody was home, which was a lie because my son was home and would have heard it. In the past when I was close to being disconnected, they would put a notice on my front door with a phone number to call. I take disconnect notices very seriously and always call the number to make arrangements. This time I got NO such notice. I was contacted via e-mail by Mr. Rudy V at the Fresno Comcast (manager), after I explained my situation. He said there was nothing he could do because I owe $82 and he couldn't find anything wrong with the serviceman's behavior. Then, on Thursday, March 26, I received in the mail a disconnection notice dated March 22, the day AFTER my cable was disconnected. If I had received it on Friday, March 20, I would have called immediately and made payment arrangements. Then, on Saturday, March 28, I got in the mail a Collection Notice from Credit Protection Association L.P. Isn't it the law that companies MUST give the consumer, in writing, advance notice of pending collection activitiy? I NEVER received any notice whatsoever of disconnection or collections. This whole incident is so unfair and I feel ripped off. I want Comcast to reconnect my cable and waive the fees and charges. The whole purpose of downgrading my Comcast service from $54/mo. to $18/mo was because I could no longer afford $54/mo. But they demanded I pay the entire bill ($146) in March. When I only paid $62 (which was already above my budget limit), they cut me off."
"Robert of Decatur, IL",3/31/2009,,"At the present moment I have been on the phone for approx 2hrs and 16 min.Trying to get ahold of comcast to cancel my internet service. No answer. I thought I would call new service, and would you believe, they answered in less than 5 seconds. Something is wrong here. I am ready to cancell all three services with comcast. The service is very poor. "
"Laurie of Belmont, CA",3/31/2009,,"   For months Comcast has been advertising when the digital conversion took place customers who already had cable did not have to do anything and need not worry.  About a month ago I received a phone call from a representative saying I needed to get converter boxes for my TVs because of the conversion.  I was shocked and said I thought we didn't have to worry if we already had cable and that I had not heard of this.  He explained to me this was separate from the federal converstion and that actually the commercials were a little misleading, that Comcast was going through their own converstion and if I did not get the boxes prior to March 15 we would lose channels above channel 35.  I expressed my displeasure but he said that the boxes were ""free"", no charge to comcast customers.  I told him how many tv's I had in the house and he said that exceeded the limit??? and that I would have to pay $1.99 per month per extra converter box.  Unhappy again, I said fine send them out.  It was supposed to be an easy set up - customer set up, called in and they did the transition there.  Did this, but two of the tv's, the ones with VCR's did not work right.  For a mere charge of $15.99 they would come out and install it correctly.  They came out, supposedly rewired something and said everyting was fine.  When we went to tape a show our VCR did not work.  Nothing was taped.  Tried several times, nothing.  We called, they came out again.  This technician told us that our VCR's would no longer work with the new converter boxes we just got.  He said we would need a DVR from Comcast (of course there is an additional charge of $15.95/mo plus the one time $19.99 installation - along with that $1.99/mo charge for the extra tv)or, in the alternative, we could undue all the hookups to tape from our paid for VCR and then hook everyting back to watch tv.  Okay so here we are, our bill has been $59.95/mo, now in order to apparently watch tv and be able to record a program they want us to pay $77.89 total (not including set up fees). Then there is the 2nd VCR which would be an additional $15.95 for the DVR - with a grand total of $93.84/mo.  Now, did I also tell you this is for my retired parents who are on a fixed income?  This to me is a Comcast scam to take advantage of the who federal conversation and for them to try to make more money.  My parents cannot afford this - they entertain themselves with a lot of tv watching, including taped programs from their VCR's.  I think this is unreasonable for people to expect that they can no longer use any  of their equipment (especially sine they don't have to pay a monthly fee for their paid for VCR's)  Comcast complete mislead the public and are slipping one by customers.  I feel this is a unfair business practice.  I have heard of at least 4 different people complaining about this same issue.

"Jim of Duluth, GA",4/3/2009,,"Your company has the worst customer service I have ever encountered! There are the missed appointments, lies, faulty service. Customer reps hang up on you, etc., etc., etc.! I have had no cable for over a week. The missed appointments cost me over 2 days work so far and several phone calls cost, wasted my time. Customers should file a class action suit "
"Jennifer of Aurora, CO",4/3/2009,,"Well, as of today I have had two horrible experiences with Comcast. I've been with Comcast since 07/2008. Two months ago I had a chatting session with one of Comcast's representatives over upgrading my service. She gave me all this hoopla on how because I pay my bills before due date, I would get all these great deals and free promotions. Later the same day, I thought it must be too good to be true. I went online to confirm all these wonderful deals. Of course, the man had no idea. Thank God I copied and pasted the entire conversation! Well, I was P.O. of course. I informed the representative about what took place and pasted him the conversation, as well as sent the entire conversation to the FCC with a complaint. But don't get me wrong, he went above and beyond to keep me as a customer.Then, I just moved to my first home and transferred my service, and kept my box from my last place. I am unable to access On Demand (Error 4). I called this time and a gentleman who seemed tired said he will reset it, and to wait 30 minutes. I wait and guess what happened next? On the second call, I got some woman with a condescending attitude. I tried to have her just reset my box and fix the On Demand. Well, we went from the problem with my box to my billing issues (note that I had received promotional deals 2 months prior), stating that I should be paying $15 for my box, but I am only paying a fraction. I informed the woman (customer service) that I have a promotional deal. She stated that because I have a DVR-HD box (I've had this box since service started), I am being charged for just the HD. Why am I going over with the type of box that was given to me at the time I started service? She would not let up, stating I got off for months, like I was robbing them from the get-go.  I asked for a supervisor. Well, she came back on saying, ""I spoke to my supervisor and we will cut the price,"" which is more than what I am paying now. My bill is already more than what it should be. I finally got a supervisor who sounded just like the representative. She was not trying to help, either. I just said that I did not call to go over my bill (mind you I pay my bill the first of the month, every month), I called to get my box reset so I can enjoy the On Demand that I am paying for! I got it done, but for some odd reason she was so quick to set up an appointment for a service man to come and visit. Why? Can you or can you not reset my box?All in all, I am ready to settle for a dish. I felt so belittled and upset by the hour that was wasted just to fix the box. Thanks Comcast! FYI, my second letter to the FCC and State Attorney General's office will be sent. There needs to be some type of policy or procedure that your customer service center should take on manners and respect towards customers who will be loyal to your company in the future."
"K of West Yarmouth, MA",4/4/2009,,"I am with Comcast and was unable to access my email. I got a 400 error and was asked to call Comcast or chat with a rep. I clicked on chat and after 15 minutes, I am still not connected. I called Comcast to report and got a message that they have a heavy call volume. They said to call back later and then I was hung up on."
"David of Middletown, MD",4/6/2009,,"On March 01, 2009, I had a service call by Comcast because of poor Internet service. The Comcast service tech diagnosed the problem as a faulty signal booster and removed the part. The signal booster had previously been installed by Comcast! The problem was fixed; however, Comcast billed us $24.95 for the service call to remove a faulty part they installed!. Between 3/6/09 and 4/6/09, I have placed four calls to Comcast to address this billing issue. I was told by two different customer service representatives that they would call back. To date, no one has called and I am still waiting for a $24.95 credit on my next bill."
"Carmen of Dickson, TN",4/7/2009,,"On 04/03/09, my email was not working so I called Comcast. They let me know that there was a problem with their service and they apologized. Shortly after that, a Comcast tech showed up here at my home to fix my computer (which by the way I did not order but since he was here, I figured it was a plus since he could now fix the problem). He asked what was the trouble. I explained that my email was not working so he proceeded to try and fix the problem. But instead, he and someone he contacted at Comcast decided that the way to resolve my problem was to change my email; he never asked me if it would be alright. By doing this they did away with my existing email which by the way I've had for 15 years and all my friends, family, banks, doctors and all the businesses I do business with cannot get in touch with me. Now Travis said that all I had to do was set up another email account. That is easy for him to say since it was not causing any problems for him. Here it is 4/6/09 in the evening and I still do not have my email back. They keep telling me they are working on it but nothing has been corrected as of yet. I've left a message for him (Travis **) but I still have not heard from him either. I am very frustrated and upset. I understand that this should never have happened, because no one has the right to change your email without permission. Someone forgot to tell Travis."
"Lionel of San Francisco, CA",4/7/2009,,"They double-billed us for 18 months. We had cancelled our service at **, SF and transferred the service to our new location, **, SF. They continued to bill us for service at **. We found out, alerted them and they sent us a check in November of 2008 to the old address! Since then, it has been hours of talking to representatives over the telephone, trying to get some answers as to when we will receive our check for $1080. They said it would take 4-6 weeks from February 19th, making it around April 1st that we should have received our check. I keep getting promised that someone will call us with a date of when the check will be sent to us, and still we have not received a phone call or the check."
"Joseph of Fort Wayne, IN",4/8/2009,,"As I sit here waiting for a supervisor to get expedited service, I'm using my cell phone, of course, at my cost. I've been watching my modem reset every 5 minutes or so for the past hour, rendering internet access and home phone service virtually nonexistent. Yes, I made the mistake of getting all 3 services from Comcast. My telephone constantly drops calls, so my home phone service - a vital necessity - doesn't work. Last Friday, on a business call, it dropped 4 times in 1/2 hour. About 2 weeks ago, a service call was scheduled, but no one showed. I learned that if you're not home to take a recorded pre-service call the night before, the service call is cancelled. It's now been 15 minutes on my cell, and no supervisor has answered. As of now, my service is set for Friday morning - that's 2 1/2 days with a modem that resets every few minutes and no consistent phone service. This is what you have to look forward to with Comcast. "
"Sharon of Harding, PA",4/8/2009,,"This cable company will nickel and dime you to death. We have cable/digital/ and internet service from Comcast. We lost service in February for being late with payments. I was told it was all computer-generated. I hate the fact that a computer runs my life. With losing service, I was not able to make the free payment online and was charged $2. They turned on the cable, but the second payment was 10 days late and they would not restore internet. I made second payment, again, with $2 charge. I asked to be credited for days without service. No. Why should I pay for something I wasn't allowed to have? If I miss work, I don't get paid! Okay, next bill rolls around. Both $2 charges, 2 reactivation fees @ $5.99.I made a service call for crappy reception, freezing picture, pixely, sound in & out. Man came out, changed connections around, and said that the picture should be better. I got charged for the service call, almost $30, and they blamed it on my TV. Picture is still crap. I cannot watch certain channels at all. All I asked for was to be credited the fees I had to incur, because I couldn't make the free payment ($4) and credit for days I did not have internet (which was 6 days/$27.95 per month = 90 cents /day = $5.40, and removal of the service call charge of $29.70. Total of $39.10. What frustrates me most is I cannot have a satellite dish because of living by a mountain, so they can just do whatever they want. But they did offer me a coupon for a free movie, which I can't watch?!"
"Mary of Jersey City, NJ",4/9/2009,,"This is the second time the same problem has occurred. After making my monthly payment by check over the phone, I received confirmation from rep also by mail. While preparing to pay next month's bill, I saw I've been charged an insufficient funds fee. My account had over $2,000 at the time I was charged this fee. After a bank rep verified this, I thought the problem was solved. This is no way to run a reputable biz."
"Larry of Lancaster, PA",4/10/2009,,"I set up an appointment to have two cable outlets installed on Thursday, April 9th between 3:30 and 5:30pm. When I set up the appointment, I was never asked if I wanted a call on my house phone or cell phone. I asked the representative if Comcast wanted my cell phone and I was told that wouldn't be needed. I was never advised that someone would call me prior to the arrival. I was never told that if I do not answer the phone that Comcast would not come out at all. At 5:21pm, I called Comcast and was told that it looks like someone tried to call me. I was advised that a supervisor would call me after trying to find someone to come to my house. At 6:12pm, I called back to Comcast and was told someone would call me. And 2 minutes later, I did get a call back advising me I wasn't forgotten and someone would call me back with an estimated time of arrival. It is now after 11:00pm and no call no show. I am very upset!I took off work at 2:30 to make sure I would be home. I was joking to my co-workers at Verizon that I would be a missed appointment. My boss said why I am still with Comcast, not with DirecTV. I told her I like Comcast and never had problems. Plus, the high speed internet works better with Comcast vs. DSL. I need the faster download speeds, not 768k-1.5mps. My wife, for the last couple of years, wanted to change to DirecTV but I stayed with Comcast. Because of this event, the pressure is on to change. My wife and I both work on Friday, April 10th. I don't know if I will get a call from Comcast and if I do, I cannot accept cell phone calls unless it is my break or lunch. I don't want to take off and waste more of my vacation time. I would like to have the install happen after I get off work at 6pm. I would hope the install would be free and I would like some type of compensation for my time I wasted. At Verizon on dispatched calls, we must get two CBR's. On the day of the install, the tech shows up and if you are not there, then Verizon leaves. If Verizon says you will get a call back, you will get one even if it is bad news."
"Trish of Arlington Hts, IL",4/12/2009,,"I called to set up a payment plan to pay off $190 remaining balance without having service interrupted. The person I spoke with took my checking account information and I was told everything was taken care of. The following day, my service was interrupted and when I called to see what had happened, I was told nothing was taken care of and there was nothing showing I had even had a conversation with anyone."
"Carol of Chaska, MN",4/13/2009,,"It was not the individual. All they can do is take the complaint, which she did and she apologized. What happened is that I have the full Comcast package with cable TV, internet and telephone. We upgraded to the HBO package. It is over $100 a month. The problem is I turned on my once a week special series on MasterPiece Theatre on our local public TV station and the audio feed was not working. Yet every other channel was working. As soon as the program was over, the audio came back. I missed part 3 of the Little Dorrit program - an English adaptation written by Charles Dickenson. The customer agent checked to see when it was going to be on again and could not find any part 3 being shown again. I do not want to pay Comcast over $100 a month for what I see as sub-level technology."
"Al of Bel Air, MD",4/13/2009,,"Since getting cable for my new HD TV about 12 months ago, I have called at least 10 times for service persons to fix the problem of the picture and the sound cutting in and out and freezing. After 10 service calls by lead technicians, the problem still exists. The last service technician was just here yesterday (4-11-09). At $140 a month, I don't think I should be subjected to this shoddy service and waste of my time on the telephone with Comcast and waiting for Comcast to come to my home. Please get this problem straight or please contact an executive to get this problem taken care of. The economic damage is my payment of $140 a month times 12. The physical damage is all the headaches and stress for waiting on the phone for Comcast and waiting for someone to attempt to repair the problem."
"Bruce of Freeport, TX",4/14/2009,,"I had a large Sony TV and I went into Comcast saying I want an HDTV box and service. I started having problems right away. The TV started losing picture and sound with digital squares appearing. I had made about 15 calls; they wanted me to unplug my TV to reboot the box. What a pain in the **. This is typically what Comcast will do every time you call them with a problem. Five times, Comcast came out and each time they said they fixed it. The 4th time, a girl came out and said my TV was going bad! Duh! Just imagine what I did. I went out and bought a new one. Then I found out the new service has a refurbished box. Just think: a new service with an old box. The 5th time they came out, the Comcast service guy said I did not have an IP address. Now, several months later, I am having the same problems. Iâ€™m tired of talking to people not from the United States saying unplug my box and reboot! PS: I sold a perfectly good Sony TV and a Sony surround sound system for a loss of $500."
"Thelma of League City, TX",4/14/2009,,"My Comcast TV Cable stopped working on November 20, 2008. A Comcast repair technician said the problem was that the Comcast signal was too weak. He fixed the problem by installing a signal booster on the line outside my home. He said I would not be charged for the trouble call. I was charged on my next bill for that call. Although I have Pay Direct bank draft to Comcast, that trouble call charge showed up on my December bill as an unpaid balance. I called Comcast billing office on December 17, 2008, and the billing support person told me to ignore that bill since their computer billed it in error. She said she had fixed the billing problem. The billing error showed up on the January bill still as an unpaid balance. I called Comcast again at their billing phone number 713-341-1000. Again, the Comcast billing office said their billing system was in error, and while I was on the phone, she (Pat) said she removed the error amount from my bill. The March billing still showed an unpaid balance. I went to the Comcast office in Webster with all of my billings and documentation, and the clerk behind the counter checked my account and said my bill was paid in full but the billing statement still said there was an unpaid balance. On April 11, I lost access to the TV cable signal. The message on my TV screen said â€œUnauthorizedâ€. I executed a live chat with Comcast Customer Support person (Raymond). He checked my account and sent an â€˜instant hitâ€™ signal to reactivate my account. My complaint is that since last November, I have needed to work with Comcast each month and thus far have not received accurate billing. Additionally, I have lost service from lack of signal twice. I am considering changing to a different TV cable provider. Perhaps, I will change to DirecTV. I spent many hours trying to resolve this problem, lost the use of my TV, and when Comcast sent the â€˜instant hitâ€™ signal to reactivate my converter box, I had to go through a difficult procedure to recycle the box - that is, I had to unplug the box from the wall and re-plug it in. That sounds simple enough, but my converter box is fitted into an entertainment center. The power plug is not easily accessible. It was difficult for me."
"Denise of Lodi, CA",4/15/2009,,"I made a past due payment of $203 on my acct. on April 4th; Comcast EFT from my checking acct. on April 6th. I went to the office and I was told I needed to talk to my bank. I called the bank and a manager tried to help me on a 3-way call. I was told it would be 24-48 hrs for my money to be refunded. When I didn't receive the money or a call from Comcast, I called them again and was told it would take 10 business days for someone to contact me about my refund. I waited and still there was no call. I called them on 4/14/09 and was told that there was a note on my acct. stating if I called back, they were to tell me that I wouldn't receive my $431 back and there was a credit on my acct. for $203 to past due balance. I paid and someone would be in contact with me. I think they are trying to wait me out so that they can use the credit on my acct. for the next billing cycle. Can you please help me?"
"Jim of North Fort Myers, FL",4/15/2009,,"We had the services of Comcast installed 5 weeks ago. These services included high-speed internet and digital phone service. Each of these has a host of add on's like voicemail, 911 services, taxes, etc. When the service was first installed, the phone did not work and we were ultimately provided the service 3 days later. We were told that was a trouble ticket. We explained that when we never used the phone. The justification was that it worked when the installer left so we sucked it up and just rationalized that we would pay the bill in spite of no service. The difficulty then became that all of the movers, suppliers, family that had been given the contact number were getting a message that the voicemail was not set up and were just hung up on. We did not know this so delivery people took furniture back to their warehouses and family was at a loss as to what was going on.Calls to service which is supposed to be 24 hours a day 7 days a week allowed us to discover that this is not really the case. There is no service on weekends. You can talk to a voicemail and fight your way through the voicemail system. ""Thank you for calling. Please continue to hold. We will be on the phone shortly to answer your call. Please be assured that your call will be answered as quickly as possible. Please continue to hold for a few more moments. We will be on the call shortly. Please be assured that your call will be answered as quickly as possible,"" with music provided, over and over. I am pretty sure that I have been through this several hundred if not a thousand times.Last evening, the high-speed internet went down and we were instructed that with the input of trouble ticket ** that we would have high-speed internet service in the morning, but it could take up to 72 hours. In actuality by morning, we lost our digital phone service as well. This means that we have no phone or high-speed internet. Now, I have been on the telephone with Comcast for about 2. I was calling and indicating that I wanted service on the voicemail. After getting the final question in a series of about 7 touch 2 touch 1, 2 or 3, I got to the point where I was being switched to a service professional and the phone would become disconnected. Now, this was curious so I repeated the process about 5 times to just determine if indeed this was the system. I am guessing that there is actually limited or no staff to take service calls.We have been told that we have a commercial account and many of the times that we call the information after 5 weeks that Comcast has on file for us is related to the previous owners of the number. We are in a community of 790 some homes that the homeowners association contracts with for basic cable service. One would only guess that this provides a distinct marketing advantage to Comcast. We still have no telephone service after 3 hours on the telephone with the representative. All of our I-Touch units now do not work because the reconfiguration of the router. Our Apple TV which took hours in its own right to get set up is disconnected again. We will be all day getting this set up again and for this, we will lose a day of work to be here to babysit with Comcast."
"Gary of Brewster, NY",4/17/2009,,"We subscribed to the triple play plan last month. Included in this plan is the maximum speed (not sure of the technical terms) allowed for our Internet usage. We have noticed our speed is the same and actually slower. After speaking to a Comcast rep, it was determined it was not our computer and something Comcast has to fix. I think this is a scam where you pay more for more speed but get the same speeds as before. I mean, how do you actually know? And if the speed is slower, they always blame the router or your computer. I don't buy it!"
"Connie of Laurel, MD",4/17/2009,,"I have basic cable service and they dropped the Maryland Public TV channel from the lineup. How can this be allowed? It's not like this is some obscure channel like 86 or 93. This is channel 22, a local Maryland station. Now I have snow on channel 22. Great. Shouldn't they be required to carry local channels?"
"Kevin of Middletown, NJ",4/22/2009,,"This problem all started when I received a bill for the month of March for over 200 dollars for cable for the month. I called up and asked why my bill jumped up so high, and they said that I rented a lot of movies that month. I wasnâ€™t aware that anyone at the house was renting anything, so I asked around and we didnâ€™t. I asked Comcast to look into it for me because Iâ€™ve never heard of a cable bill being so high and because we didnâ€™t rent anything. We already pay for HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, and Stars, so we have all movie channels. Also, we have 2 cable boxes, one of which Comcast never activated and one that was broken (on-demand was down). Comcast thought it looked funny that one movie was rented 6 times in March. And we have it on DVD, so we know we didnâ€™t rent that. Anyhow, who rents a movie 6 times in one month? We do not have a bill this month. She confirmed and said she was going to send out to me a revised statement.About a week later, I received a bill from Comcast stating that I owe $206.11. Confused, I call back into Comcast and ask why I received this if my bill was waived. They have no record of me calling at first. Then, I ask to speak with a supervisor and there isnâ€™t one working there that day. After about an hour on the phone and long hold times, the woman comes back on the phone and tells me that the supervisor I spoke to last time added comments to the account but forgot to actually take off the $206.11. She confirms to me itâ€™s no problem at all, and she said that she is going to go ahead and remove it again like the first person was supposed to do. I explained how long it took to get this settled last time as well as this time, and she confirmed to me she will be personally handling it and that it was removed. Once again, I ask for a written statement showing that they removed it be sent to me at my address on record. She agreed. I said, â€œThank youâ€ and we hung up.Another few days go by and I receive a letter in the mail saying that my account is overdue now (107 dollars) and I owe a total of 306 dollars. Outraged by another Comcast mistake, I call the phone number that I was given by the previous person helping me. The extension does not exist! â€œNot even close to an extension Comcast uses,â€ they said. So I start from scratch from the bottom again. Now, this is the third time I have called in on the same issue Comcast told me they are sorry about and have told me will be handled. Now, the bill is telling me that the bill is overdue and my service will be shut off if I do not pay immediately. I request time off at work and call into Comcast to once again start from scratch. This time, I ask for a supervisor right away. I talk to her for an hour, and she first told me she sees nothing on the account when I specifically asked the last person I spoke with to add comment to the account. I talk for an hour and get nowhere. She decides she is going to look into it and call me back later in the day. She calls me back at 7pm one night and tells me that she hasnâ€™t gotten anything on it and that sheâ€™s still working on it. Meanwhile, Iâ€™m not sure if I should pay my bill or not. She said to hold off and she would place a stop on the collections until the issue was resolved. She tells me that she will call me tomorrow when she finds out what happened. Next day, no call from the supervisor who said she would call me between 5 and 6pm. I get in to work in the morning and call Venessa and leave her a message asking whatâ€™s going on and why she was not back in touch with me yesterday. I get a voice mail (doesnâ€™t even ring). Later on that day, I get back from lunch and I have a message from Venessa saying that they looked into it and have decided not to adjust the bill. I told her that it was already decided a few weeks ago by a field technician that it was impossible for our household to rent movies and that all on-demand movies were going to be removed. She said they will stick with the inconvenience fee, but I owe them 300 dollars still. I call back and again I get a voice mail right away. This is illegal and someone needs to monitor Comcastâ€™s Billing. There is no way anyone in my house rented any movies prior to the technician coming over to fix it. It was impossible and I have the documented receipt with his comments on it to prove it."
"Nathan of Boulder, CO",4/22/2009,,"I turned in my Comcast equipment. They said that I had an outstanding equipment so I turned in what I had and paid my bill for service up to the proper day of 1/22/09. I ended the service that day at the Comcast store. I called up DISH Network the next day and set up service. Next month, I received a bill from Comcast saying I owed them for service until February. I called and said that I disconnected their service in January. I was told that I cannot disconnect until my equipment was turned in. So for the next three months, I got billed for a service I never used or wanted. I read their terms and agreements thoroughly and nowhere does it state that. In fact, Section 9, letters B and D say otherwise. So I have talked to numerous supervisors and employees.Today, I just got a letter from collections about the service and equipment for almost $900. At best, I only owe $250 for the equipment.  Itâ€™s only because I canâ€™t prove that they didnâ€™t take my modem when they upgraded (which they did) and a cable box that was outdated (and also switched). I got the missing equipment in February of 2006."
"Steve of Cumming, GA",4/23/2009,,"Comcast Internet double charged me on my internet. When I contacted them, they told me to adjust my bill and send in payment. I did, they cut off my service without calling and notifying me. When I contacted to explain the situation for the 5th time including hold times over 45 min., they told me to pay the full bill and they would credit my account the next bill. I explained again that Jerrod, operator **, told me to pay the amount I owed. Their excuse again was to pay all the over charges and they would correct it on the next bill. Their customer service is the worst unless you're off the coast of Somalia and dealing with pirates. This has not been the only problem with service. Phone has gone down several times. This is also a business line. Warning, stay away from Comcast."
"James of Shingle Springs, CA",4/23/2009,,"In February, I requested that Comcast please not send a contractor to our apartment complex due to unsafe and sloppy work. Gary ** said that would be no problem and he understands. After this, the last service request they sent out a contractor (Orange County Communications). I sent them away and called Comcast and requested they send Comcast employees. The Comcast employees came out and did sloppy unprofessional work as well. (I used to work for a Comcast contractor.) I called Gary ** and complained and have not received any response. I would like Comcast to fix their slop and do their job correctly. I also want future work to be done correctly. We are fixing the exterior of our place and don't want spliced up cable and splitters all over the exterior of our buildings. We are helping Comcast because we are stopping satellite companies from splicing the cable and mounting Dish on exterior. This preserves the Comcast cable so they won't need to rewire every time they come out."
"Peter of Des Plaines, IL",4/23/2009,,"I have sent repeated emails over the past month to Comcast regarding my cable service. The problem is that the cable service is non-functioning, but yet I am still being billed. I told them that it appears that the problem exists with their feeder lines outside of my home, but no one checked. One day, a service rep came and all he did was to replace the splitter and then he left. About three weeks ago, I received the modem for high speed internet, which I cannot use, but wish to use due to fact I do not have cable service. I am also being billed for high speed internet, but it is not even connected to the computer. I have told them many times when I was available at home, but no one has ever shown up. How many more months must I wait for service? How many more months must I pay for service, which does not exist?"
"Charlotte of Plainfield, IL",4/23/2009,,"My April Comcast bill was higher by $5.20. While investigating, I noticed I was charged for a movie ordered at 7:15AM on 4/3. We are not even home at 7:15 AM. After telling Comcast customer service that we did not order the movie and never have in the past ordered movies, they insisted that the order came from our box number and that they could only issue a one time credit for this. I asked if perhaps there could have been a mistake on their part, but they insisted the order came from us. This really is frightening to think that someone could have accessed our box remotely somehow to order the movie, but Comcast insisted that this could never happen. I hope their investigation of this matter finds out what really happened because if it happened to us, it can happen to others. I sure hope they improve their customer service attendants' attitudes."
"Vickie of Fishers, IN",4/24/2009,,"Our cable, internet, and phone service are terrible. After five missed appointments, I stopped the phone service. The technician never showed! He dropped off the modem and I installed it. We have cable internet only sporadically and they again can't send a technician. They can't fix it over the phone. I pay my bill every month for service we cannot enjoy. The cable TV works, but is often snowy when the service is interrupted. I can't conduct my business so I have to use a local copy center for internet access. We watch videos and buy the paper since we can't watch TV. They know I don't have any options and are so arrogant when I call for help. "
"Chris  of Yuba City, CA",4/24/2009,," i got a notice at the end of march saying we would be shut off on 4\24\09 if we didn't pay the balance in full. (when we moved to the place where we live now we had comcast switched over but in the process we got stuck with a bill for service at our previous residence for the few weeks that it was empty so we could clean it out before we turned in the keys. i decided to just pay on it till the balance was clean) so when the statement said they wanted the balance paid in full i thought they were talking about the 10 or 15 dollars i still had left to pay for from the move. well on 4/16/09 my service was shut off. i went in and paid 60 dollars (cuz thats all i had at that day) to get it turned back on. from what i got from the statement i got the balance was $166. so i told the lady at the payment center i would be back on the 23rd to pay the $106. i went back on the 23rd like i said i would. and i was making the payment when she told me the payment due was $83.69. i asked what the total bill was, she told me $236 & change. i asked why? she said that the $124 i paid in march was returned for insufficient funds.  i was shocked. i didn'y recieve anything from the bank saying i was being charged an over the limit fee or anything that would go along with what she was saying. i talked with my wife because we use her account for bill payments. so we went online and checked her account for comcast payments or returns and there was nothing for march. so now me and my wife have to make a conference call with her bank and comcast. because they charged us a return check fee and late payment fee along with the $124 wich was suppose to be taken. i hate comcast. when it comes to payments and things like this its always horrible. i was shocked. i didn'y recieve anything from the bank saying i was being charged an over the limit fee or anything that would go along with what she was saying. i talked with my wife because we use her account for bill payments. so we went online and checked her account for comcast payments or returns and there was nothing for march. so now me and my wife have to make a conference call with her bank and comcast. because they charged us a return check fee and late payment fee along with the $124 wich was suppose to be taken. i hate comcast. when it comes to payments and things like this its always horrible."
"Brenda  of New Castle, IN",4/24/2009,, This is the poorest run company I have ever dealt with.  Everyone we have talked to states that Comcast has horrible customer service.  At one point I asked to talk to a supervisor and was told NO that they could only email a supervisor to call us back.  That is ridiculous.  Comcast needs turned over to the better business bureau.  As soon as school is over we will be changing our service and going with Direct TV who has good customer service.  
"Stephaine of Arlington, TN",4/25/2009,,"   I set up an appt. with Comcast to transfer service from Direct TV to them. I spent 30 Minutes explaining the services I needed and was promised the Tech coming out could do all I needed. He came out and could not drop the line. Comcast """"he said"" would reschedule. No call back for a week. Finally, someone they outsourced the job to came out. All the billing was wrong. I spent one hour on hold to correct the promblem before the tech ever started the install. I spoke with Erica at Comcast on4/8/09 and she promised me that she would handle everything. The first bill was only to reflect taxes. The first bill was 532.33? I made a payment on site of 174.11. I have been calling Comcast for four days with no return call back. I have left messages with managers and Erica. If they think anyone in there right mind would transfer a service that costs 550.00 to be theres they are crazy.  This has been the worst experience I have ever had with a company of there size that has no regard for a customer. Don't ever transfer your service to Comcast because they do not honor there agreement/overcharge you no one will assist with the promblem. I have documentation on everything and fully intend to call fox news and let everyone know IF YOU TRANSFER TO COMCAST IT COST YOU 550.00 to do so. I have only had service for two weeks.

"Joseph of Houston, TX",4/26/2009,,"Out of the blue, my internet and home phone service with Comcast went out. Occasionally, a quick reset of the modem takes care of everything. This wouldn't come back on. I called the service people, who advertise their 24/7 availability, and was told that although they were still there, it was late in the day on Friday and nothing would be done. I was told at first that nothing would be done until Monday. Since the phone service includes 911, I protested. The representative told me my claim had been escalated and that someone would call me the next day (Saturday) and also visit that day to fix everything.Having heard nothing by nearly noon on Saturday, I called again. A representative tried to reset the system again and then told me when that failed that the service people would call me within 30 minutes. After an hour, nothing. My service came back on briefly and then disappeared again. I called Comcast again and someone reset the system again and I had service briefly. He apologized but didn't get in touch with anyone at service and more or less hung up before I could ask for a supervisor. My system went down yet again. I called Comcast and finally someone explained to me that the previous employee had lied to me or misled me about the way service works and that no one was ever going to just come out the next day or call within 30 minutes. While I appreciated his honesty, when I complained about the lack of 911 service, he told me, ""You don't want your service on so you can call 911"" and continued to refer to my outage as an inconvenience. No one anticipates calling 911. I've had to do it several times from my home, and I expect that a company that promises services I use for personal, business and emergency reasons will provide those services and not expect me to wait 72 hours to have them returned. The system has flickered back on, but no one has explained why this happened or made sure it won't happen again. At this point, I am in an agreement with a cancellation fee before two years, but I feel that Comcast should waive the fee. I'm certainly canceling my service. I'd recommend everyone be very careful about this company. Their promises are tantalizing but their service is reprehensible."
"Alexa of Vallejo, CA",4/27/2009,,"We signed a contract with Comcast for phone and internet service in June 2008. Since then, we have been continuously overcharged and ignored, even though we saved all contractual documents. When we show up in person at a Comcast store, we are dismissed and told to call the 1-800 number. When we call the 1-800 number, we are told they can't help us because they can't see the contractual documents that we have, yet they won't provide a phone, fax, or mailing address to send copies. If this were a small business, it would be an easy legal suit. Comcast is so large and unorganized that each time I speak to someone new, most, if not all, of the notes on our account have ""disappeared"" and they aren't even sure who I've spoken to before or who made changes to my account. This is ridiculous. We've wasted countless hours trying to rectify the situation and whenever we are told the situation will be fixed and the credit will be applied to our account, it does not appear and those notes disappear. I am not sure what their employees are paid to do because they can never help us, and sometimes they flat out lie. It's disgusting that big businesses can get away with practices like this. I'm just waiting to receive my credit and cancel service."
"Dolores Hernandez of Houston, TX",4/27/2009,,"   When I sign on to Comcast I asked if HGTV, History Channel, Discovery Channel, and Nat Geo came with the plan and they said yes. A year and a half later, they take away Nat Geo.  How can they quote you a price for these channels and then take it away.  BUT did they reduce my rate,  HA.  "
"Sandra of The Woodlands, TX",4/27/2009,,I feel this is completely discriminatory.
"Jason of Savannah, GA",4/28/2009,," After talking with several supervisors they told me that their system is infailable and that we watched those movies and will be charged for them. I immediately canceled my service for both cable and internet with them. I have not been able to find a way to talk with anyone higher then the ""supervisors' who wont help me. Is there a way to speak to someone higher up in the corporation? We are being charged $100.00 that we will not pay which means this will affect our credit."
"Nemesio of Houston, TX",4/28/2009,,"   We have tv cable service with Comcast, in Houston, Texas, and this includes FoxNews channel 38.  For the past month or longer, Channel 38 had been on and off on our tv, and when we call comcast they always tell us that comcast is updating their service, or is having technical problems in our area.  However, for the past 2 days, Channel 38 showed up on our tv on and off, until 5:00 PM (our time), then for the whole evening we could not watch the channel 38, missing our favorite programs with FoxNews.  When this happens, we checked and noticed that only Channel 38 is unviewable. Therefore, we can assume that not being able to view Channel 38 on our TV is intentionally done by Comcast, and could even be possibly politically motivated.We need help to investigate this problem, since our last call to Comcast we were told that it could be Channel 38's problem, not Comcast.  Comcast offered to send a technician, and I refused because they could just come and blame it on our house cable connections and the fee could be high."
"Francisco of Homestead, FL",4/29/2009,,"   I have been without internet for 6 days, i called comcast tech support, they say i must have internet, they try reseting modem, this that, but no internet, they schedule a tech to come, so i loose half day waiting the van just passed by and did not call me at all, and just reschedule the appoint for 2 more days, and still not internet, and no ways they can send tech before that time, probably the technitian did not want to do the job, he did not even mind to stop, only drove around 60 miles per hour i ran behind him but even when i call right away to report they were unable to send him back or do it faster. So tech support in comcast is horrible i probably know more than them. In few words comcast techinical service is unprofessional."
"Roger of Millbrae, CA",4/30/2009,,"   The first incident of wrong doing, is when the service technician did not call in advance before he came to my apartment and lied that he showed up, thus not honoring my $20 rebate.  Then, I was lied to by a customer service rep about the time of service.  When I finally received a copy of my order, I see charges for services I didn't order.  I was told to call customer service and was insured the changes were made.  The changes were not made, so my bill was high.  I have been lied to in my several calls to customer service.  It's three months later, and I am still incorrectly billed."
"Alaina of Atlanta, GA",5/1/2009,,"I recently disconnected my internet and phone service with AT&T due to telephone issues. I switched to Comcast ""high-speed"" internet and cable TV. I have only had the service for a few months and already I've called and contacted customer service almost 7 times! Ridiculous! Either my cable TV signal is screwy or the on-demand will not pull up. Now my Comcast ""high-speed"" internet is the slowest it's ever been! AT&T is better people! Seriously, I never had problem with their internet service and now I'm seriously considering switching back. Comcast is a joke. Their commercials are false and their internet is the worst I've ever had! Either it disconnects halfway through or it takes 10 minutes or more to connect, period! Getting from page to page is a hassle. I have to continuously refresh the page and retry! I've tried everything, even their McAfee security which is also a joke. My laptop is only 6 months old! My hard drive is clean and it runs smoothly without the internet. But every time I get online, it's one headache after another. I'm seriously fed up and their customer service rep on their online chat disconnected from me after she read my complaint. How rude! They are ignoring my complaints and have yet to find a solution! AT&T is so much better."
"Wallis  of Mechanicsville, VA",5/1/2009,,I also think it takes long time to go on line.  I am thinking of changing my service to another company.
"Christine of Chesapeake Beach, MD",5/4/2009,,"   My husband is home on vacation this week and he is finally getting to see how lousy Comcast is!  I complain to him about it all the time, but he never gets to see it.  The TV is pixeling, the phone doesn't work, all the things I have told him about he is finally getting to see first hand!"
"Joseph of Washington, DC",5/5/2009,,"   A Comcast van sideswiped my parked car on 3/27/2009, and kept on driving. Witnesses saw the accident, and saw the van leave the scene, but did not get the plate number. I filed a police report (report #040557, First District DC Police), and I've been in touch with numerous people at Comcast who give me a run-around.My blog about the problem is here: http://comcast-hitandrun.blogspot.com"
"Rob of Abingdon, MD",5/6/2009,,"I called Comcast to report an outage with my high-speed Internet service. The first time I called, I was told nothing was wrong. I knew that wasn't true due to experiencing it for a while at that point. I called the next morning. I was told the agent saw my signal problem and would schedule a tech visit. She tried to schedule it for Friday but that was ""already taken"" when she tried. So, the next appointment that would be able to fit my schedule was Tuesday between 5 PM and 8 PM. I did that because my wife and I both work and that was a time I knew we would both be there. The agent came before 3 PM, said nobody was there so the appointment was canceled. I called to complain and was told no appointments for my account were seen but a street service call had been made for my street and he would have tech come to my door. That never happened. I called today to get an update on what the street call discovered. There was nothing there regarding it and the only help I was going to get was to schedule another service call on Friday between 2 PM and 5 PM, which means on my day off, I have to sit in my house and wait for somebody to maybe show up. When I asked for a supervisor, I was told supervisors don't take calls and I would need to leave a message and get a call back. Of course, I was told a supervisor couldn't help. It has been a week now with these issues and no resolutions. My account has poor documentation and service calls I requested aren't showing on it.My Internet service is still spotty. My cable modem, which is five years old and out-dated technology, needs to be replaced and the tech should be doing that along with checking everything from my house out to the road. I am not required to take time out of my day to get a new cable modem and get it set up or take time out of my day to sit and wait for a tech who may not show up. All this time, I am not getting the service I am paying for each month."
"George of Pleasant Hill, CA",5/6/2009,,"   Comcast advertises fast internet service, but everytime I used there service, it is deadly slow!!!! I think I can even have faster service using dial-ups!"
"Glenda of Novato, CA",5/7/2009,,"   I made a payment for $100 dollars I have send them the proof of that payment with statement of my bank a letter from a manager from Chase back they took my money they dont want to credit my account. They are stressing me out taking time from my work, shutting off my service every month."
"Shelley of Shreveport, LA",5/9/2009,,"   Each complaint is nearly identical.  Comcast, DirectTV and Dish Network have been my research so far. (My own personal struggle has been with Comcast.) I've read each of their sneaky little ""customer agreements"".  I've decided to forego television entirely.  Internet/books/movies can be my at home entertainment.  Solving specific individual complaints cannot solve a thing. Their terms of agreement should be loud and clear, not fuzzy grayed and tiny print. They don't have to be fair or reasonable if they wrote it in tiny print. The contract is for their protection (as if they need it), and not ours.  We have no protection. The most we can do is set into law that they must make their terms OBVIOUS to the consumer BEFORE the product is purchased.  The problem with that is that NOONE WHO READ THEIR AGREEMENT WOULD ACTUALLY PURCHASE THEIR PRODUCT.  Write to congressmen. By purchasing cable/satellite, I'm only purchasing a bunch of stupid channels advertising the topsy-turvey tomato and the Sham-wow anyway.  "
"Jason of Eugene, OR",5/10/2009,,"I called Comcast to report an intermediate outage with my high-speed internet service and speed problem. The first time I called, I was told nothing was wrong. I knew that wasn't true. I have major issues with my line speed and when they come out, it's early and they said, ""You're not going to get any better than that. I'm sorry, sir."" Whatever. I have never experienced this slow of speed for six years of having their service at other addresses. And if it does not get fixed very soon, I am canceling my service and going elsewhere. I have been paying top dollar for crap and it's not worth paying as much as I do to deal with their stupidity. Their techs are very unprofessional. If it's not my house, grab your ladder and check the line in from the pole. I say it's pure lazy. They look around, don't test anything or make sure everything is tight. Then they leave and it messes up over and over again."
"Lisa of Soquel, CA",5/11/2009,,"I just realized my Comcast high-speed internet bill has practically doubled. When I signed up for it, no one from Comcast ever told me that the rate would increase. When I complained about this, the Comcast rep said that the service tech (who is a local contractor and not a Comcast employee) who installed it would have told us that the $42 was a promotional rate. I told the Comcast rep that I was not even home when internet was installed, so the rep then told me that the service tech (again, a non-Comcast employee) left information that said that the $42 a month was only a 6-month promotional cost. Why didn't Comcast tell me that when I was signing up for their service? Why does Comcast rely on a local contractor who is not even a Comcast employee to inform of forthcoming changes on my bill? I want to know why, when I was on the phone signing up for Comcast internet, that I was never told about the price increase. This is not right! I think that it is totally unfair that when I was on the phone signing up for the internet, a Comcast rep told me it was going to be $42 a month. They never said it was a promotional rate and was going to jump to $72. I think Comcast should tell you that when you are signing up for their service."
"Luke of St. Paul, MN",5/11/2009,,"I had trouble with internet connection for more than five days. I found that I could not connect internet from May 1st. I waited for the line to come back one day and I reported this trouble on May 2nd, very early in the morning. At the first call, I was told that I had to change the modem, so I dropped by a Comcast service center and changed the modem. But the trouble continued, so I called again. At that time I was told that there might be some trouble in our area, so I wait for about 4 hours and try connecting the internet. But after 4 and more hours, there was still no internet connection, so I called again. At this call, I was again told that the trouble might be a regional so I wait for more time and contact them. But the internet line never came alive.So I called again the next day (May 3rd) and scheduled someone to come over. Someone scheduled (Tuesday) May 5th for service, which was according to him, the earliest day possible. On the service day, the person came could not find the trouble and scheduled another service for the next day (May 6th). On Wednesday afternoon, finally, the service people could find the problem. The total time I could not access to the internet was more than 120 hours.After all of this trouble, I called Comcast for asking credit or refund for not being able to use internet for those days, as I told from one of the representatives I talked with. A billing representative I talked with told me that I could get 2 days of credit, which is about 2 dollars something cents. I explained her that the service could not be used for more than 5 days, but she said according to the record, she could just give me 2 days of credit. Maybe they counted only Monday and Tuesday because I reported trouble on Sunday and it was fixed on Wednesday.I could not use internet for 5 days and also the cable reception was not that good either during the time. I did not hear sincere apology or any care for my inconvenience. I even had to call to get refund, but all I could get was 2 days of credit and that is less than $3! I think I have to quit my Comcast service, and I'll tell all the people I know about this story so that they would know about Comcast more."
"Jennifer of West Jordan, UT",5/13/2009,,"We signed up for Comcast in May of 2008. We asked if the price was promotional, who doesn't now, and we remember being told it wasn't. Last week we talked to a Jennifer, and her supervisor, they were going to look up sign up phone call and see if we had asked about promotional price. They also said they would call us back - like I believe that. Today I was told by Amy, ""The supervisor was unable to pull the phone conversation. These are usually 6 month promotional so don't complain about rate increases.""Well, I am complaining. If you look at their ads on their website, we could only find one that said it was a promotional offer. Most of them never mentioned that the offer was limited. Our bill never showed promotional as we saw with our DirecTV bill. It never showed a promotional discount or anything that could have brought our attention to this situation earlier. I have looked into other Internet providers and they are the only one that isn't a dial up, available to me. We never signed anything but the work paper that said the installers have fixed any damages to my yard. My sprinklers were only fixed after 4 days of phone calls."
"Patty of Ocean City, MD",5/13/2009,,"   Have two Comcast accts for 2 locations/accounts coming to primary location and tried to set up 2nd account number for on line bill pay.  Spoke to Comcast Internet assist and was informed Comcast has a known clich in our system that will not allow multiple accts to be paid on line.  Directed me back to 1-800-Comcast bill pay which they charge a service fee if you use the automated system or a higher fee if you use the Customer Svc Rep to make the payment.  Customer Service Rep would not waive the fee and their only reply was you can take the payment to an office or mail it.  This is a Comcast bill pay on line system problem and consumers are paying extra for something offered and made much a do about, but not usable."
"Reyna of Greenacres, FL",5/15/2009,,   comcast was suppost to come to my house ans install the service but the guy they send didnt want to do it.so the excuse he give me was that there was no antenna or connection cables i mean they knew it was a new customer.they were suppost to come at 5 pm too but they didnt show ed up.comcast was not giving me the services for free i was paying for it
"Sue of Acworth, GA",5/15/2009,,"   My husband at the time set up all utilities in my name back in April of 2007.  In Sept. 2008, I called the Comcast office on Cobb Pkwy. to cancel the extra service because I could not afford the monthly bills.  I was told to bring in the equipment, which I did the first part of October, 2008.Since then, I have been billed for the 3 cable boxes I had returned.  The company shows that I called and canceled the boxes, but they are showing that I ""picked up"" 3 boxes in October, rather than return them.  I have been charged $5.99 X 3 since I returned the boxes in October.  Nothing is being done.I'm promised that they'll return my call, but they don't. I was told the boxes were active and I told the girl at Comcast to turn them off.  I've spoken to numerous people over the phone and they all say there's nothing they can do, or that they'll look into this and call me.  I'm told I have to go down to the office where I returned the equipment.  I've gone down there and I'm told they can't do anything.  I call again and I'm told that they can look up the receipt.  I go down to the office and I'm told they don't have access to pulling receipts.I do not have any of the cable boxes I've been charged for during the past 8 months.  I've refused to pay the extra charges, and they shut my cable off, only to charge me for the reconnect.  I'm told I can't change my cable or cancel it because my account is on ""hold"".  I can't pay these high bills due to unemployment, and as of now, it's been 8 months of getting nowhere with this horrible company.  When my cable is turned off, I'm lied to, saying it isn't, that there ""must be something wrong and they'll work on it"", but I'm still being charged a re-connect fee.I want what I've been falsely charged for refunded to me and I want either a low rate like I use to have or I want to be allowed to drop this company."
"Greg of Vacaville, CA",5/15/2009,,My cable service doesny work. I had 3 techs out. The first one didn't show up. The second one was late by a hour. The thrid was late too. The manager showed late. And did some work. But I still have the same problems. The now wont call me back. I'm paying for service Im not getting. I can't watch TV.

"Mitchell of Mill Valley, CA",5/16/2009,," I realize each of these boxes do not pull a great deal of electricity, but when you add up the millions of boxes being plugged in around the Country, I think this is the last thing America needs - more drain on our already fragile electric grid.  Why doesn't Comcast simply send the digital signal through the lines to the houses?  Why do we need converter?  At the very least, why not place one converter where the cable enters the house to avoid multiple boxes at every television?  I wrote to Comcast and no one provided a reason for the multiple boxes.  I spoke with a Comcast representative and he agreed that Comcast has created a great deal of electronic waste and electric draw that is unnecessary.If this was a simple oversight, then I hope Comcast would see the error in their ways and make more ""Green"" solutions.  In this case, at the very least this was a really stupid and wasteful decision.But I do not think they are complete idiots.  I think Comcast Management is greedy.  Comcast would like users to order additional converter boxes for a fee, and have a vested interest in keeping their business with Comcast.  At the expense of our environment and our precious energy supply, Comcast decided to try to make an extra buck.I hope other customers will complain to make Comcast change their strategy."

"Tammy of Norton, VA",5/16/2009,,   On 5/12/2009 I called to report that my cable box was not working correctly that it would come in and out and that I know it was the box because I switched the boxes from the other room and it still did it. Just to make sure that it was not the tv or the cable. I spoke with a rep. named Latisha explained to her that I work 6 days a week 10 hour days and that the cable company was just over the hill from my apt. I also explained to her that it would be 6:00 p.m. before I got home she stated that would not be a problem she would noted that on the issue ticket and also for them to call a half hour before they would be coming.She asked me what would be the phone number that I could be reached at and I told her anytime after 5:15 p.m. it would have to be my cell phone. And that anytime before that it would be my work number. She read back all the information to me and it was correct. I thanked her and let her know how much help she was.On 4\13\2009 I come straight home her by 6:00 p.m. I waited and I waited no one ever showed up. So I call again and this time I speak with a lady named Annie I explained to her what was said and that is when she told me it was noted at 5:45 p.m. Access denied. I explained to Annie that it was noted on the issue ticket that I would not be home until 6:00 p.m. she pulled the issue ticket and agreed that is when I said I felt that comcast should have to credit me for this. Annie said I do agree but she was not the one that could do that the Tech. that would be coming out would have to. But for me to tell the Tech. On time garuntee and he would be able to have my bill ajusted. Once again I said I have been through this yesterday with Latisha and she said that they could not make then do what they are asked on the issue ticket. I do not understand that.So she asked me would 6:00 p.m. be ok and I responded that I had already made plains that I would not be home until 7:00 p.m. and she said she would note that on the issue ticket. On 5\15\2009 I got home around 6:58 p.m. and passed the comcast office and seen 4 vans and a bunch of young men stand around. I can see the business from my apartment and they can see me. At 7:15 p.m. I called the 1-800-266-2278 I was very upset to see 2 vans went east and 2 vans went west and passed my apartment by. When I called a rep. named Debbie answered and I explaind what was going on. And she said that she understood and that she could not make them do anything only issue a ticket. I said look I am getting very upset with comcast I have had nothing but problems with them from day one. I also said to her about what I saw and said look I do not get paid to just stand around and do nothing and neither do you.These young men are and it is not right it is not right that I pay someone to just stand there watching and playing around on Comcast customer's money. I also said that maybe I should pay my bill like I am getting my service and explaind to her that I am just getting upset with this. She said she understood why could I not just go to the office I said to her about my hours. And about what Annie had told me about the On time garuntee. She said that was not correct and I said to her that I did not understand are they not all trained the same way and she said yes that some people may miss interpet what is being said. She also said that she didn't know why I was told they could come that late. I explained to her that they could come that late to hook me up but could not come that late just to switch out a box. This is not understandable. I asked Debbie if I may speak to a manager and she asked me to hold. She come back on and ask me what about Sunday? I explained to her that was my only day off and that I was not setting around and waiting for them not to call. I also said they do not work on Sunday and she said yes they did and I told her that I could not promise as they have to me that I could just be home in 30 minutes that I had laundry to do and shopping also. So she put me on hold and tried to call the dispatch and she told her that they did try to call and that at 7:11 p.m. they could not get access to my house. Well Debbie agree's that that was not true when I watched them and called her at 7:15 p.m. She said that she know she had been on the phone with me for at least 45 mins. She asked me again about Sunday and I said no I may not beable to be here in 30 minutes she understood. She put me through to the manager and his name was Chris. That was about a worthless cause he went on and on about no one home on answer. I said to him that I know that they did not call after a while he said that they did try to call me it was noted right there in front of him and I told him I know better and that they lady that put me through to him know I was not lieing now he said that if I could not beable to be reached on Sunday and I said you do not work on Sunday I have never seen a van move from there on Sunday and he said I was right. Again saying the say thing about Sunday if I could not agree with that then there was nothing I could do. I told him that I was contact the better business and he said do what I had to do. So now I am not sure what I need to do but I know my rights as a paying customer and that is to be honest to them as well as them be to me and that I have not received that.  I also said they do not work on Sunday and she said yes they did and I told her that I could not promise as they have to me that I could just be home in 30 minutes that I had laundry to do and shopping also. So she put me on hold and tried to call the dispatch and she told her that they did try to call and that at 7:11 p.m. they could not get access to my house.

"Joe of Fremont, CA",5/20/2009,,"Do any people still remember when Comcast bought AT&T internet, it raised up price immediately? I bought my 1st Motorola modem and it caused many disconnections after 1-2 years, thus I bought a 2nd RCA modem and used it another 2-3 years. And again, I need to reset the modem a few times a day. Each call to Comcast is a long time waste. I then turned over to DSL and it works 1-2 years and I reset it only once.I used to tent their cable modem for a short time then use one I bought from eBay. After 2 years, Comcast suddenly started to charge my rental free and asked me to return my modem. I called in and went in and they checked with the warehouse. A lady said I was correct yet manager said the case was not completed yet. A bad thing was when I returned the rented modem, nobody gave me a receipt. This time, I was forced to give them my modem and a kind lady did give me a receipt. But I still keep all PayPal records so that I may dig out my purchase record."
"Darrell of Merrillville, IN",5/20/2009,,"My internet service with Comcast was disconnected for one year because Comcast claims that I was using too much bandwidth. I had been warned before but the person I talked to told me to purchase bandwidth monitoring software. If Comcast wants their customers to stay within certain limits, then they should provide bandwidth monitoring software. I should not have to purchase something like that myself. It should be provided by Comcast. When I opened my cellular account, I purchased a specific number of minutes that I can use every month. Whenever I want to find out how many minutes I have used, all I have to do is sign into my account and I can find out how many minutes I have used. Comcast does not have any such tool."
"Martha of Plantation, FL",5/20/2009,,"But on March 23, 2007 I received a call from a technician saying that instead of coming March 27th, he was free that day and asked if it would be alright if he came then instead. I agreed and the Comcast technician came to install the box. Now, I am a very inquisitive person and asked him why I had to have a box. I told him that I understood that as long as there was cable, one did not need the converter box. He told me it was not a converter box but a different kind of box that would give me many channels. I then asked him how long I would have to have the box and when would they come to remove it and he was evasive. He said, ""They'll call you."" When he finished installing the box, he told me to sign that I had received the box and I, in my naivet, signed the form. He did not leave me a copy and he left in a hurry.  I was delighted to have so many channels and asked my neighbors if they had also gotten a box, but none had.  A month went by and then one day I went online to see my credit card statement and print it as I do each month. When I noticed there was a charge for $63.14 from Comcast, instead of the normal fee of $12.56 that I have always paid. (I only purchase the Basic Service.) I called Comcast to question the charge and I was told that I had purchased a new service from a door-to-door Comcast salesperson. I denied this and explained above what I have told you and I was told that I had signed for the service and that they would not remove the charge. (Of course!! That was the form I signed for the technician, thinking I was only signing that the box had been delivered and installed!) I told them I did not order the service and asked they come and remove the box and put my service back the way it was before: to the basic service for $12.56.  After that, I attempted several times to speak to different Comcast customer service reps and none of them wanted to hear what I was saying.  Finally, one day last week I called again and spoke to customer service rep, Reyna, who was very nice, heard me out and said she was sorry for what I was put through. She asked me if I wanted her to tell her Supervisor that I wanted this to be investigated and I said yes.  So I assume it is being investigated. It should be by checking what date the box was installed in my home and the name of the individual who did it. Your records will show who it was.I have figured out what happened. Probably someone in your Company who will either get a commission for selling door-to-door (or must meet a quota) dreamed up the scam of having his girlfriend call the Comcast customers and give them the story I was given and the appointment set up in order not to have to come selling door-to-door. Once the appointment is made, it's a piece of cake, he comes in, installs the box to the unsuspecting customer, makes them sign that they received the box (when they are actually signing a new service order) and makes his commission (or adds to his quota) with no hassles. Comcast is unaware of these unscrupulous people they have hired. The name of the technician who came to my house, when I asked him his name, said his name was Shane or Sean. He is a tall, black fellow. This scam perpetrated against me has caused me anger, indignation and sleepless nights because I feel violated and will write to the City of Plantation and NBC about this.

"James of Woodbine, GA",5/23/2009,,   I've had comcast for a long time and would like to keep it! But getting tired of the way Woodbine customers are being treated!When HD can I kept calling about it and comcast said it's not in Woodbine yet. Now everyone around Woodbine has on deman I call Woodbine don't have it and they don't know when it will get here if ever! Woodbine is small and I guess wouldn't mean that much if comcast lost it as a customer.But please realize that people in Woodbine pay the same amount as everyone around us but we get so much less. Why dose comcast think thats fair? Why are we not kept informed on whats going on around us? 
"Mark of Albuquerque, NM",5/24/2009,,"      I made an appointment to have an additional drop installed and I was also having difficulty with a HD DVR box supplied by Comcast. The appointment window was between 10 and noon. At noon I called and the Tech was running late and he would be at our house by 2:00pm. At 2:30 I called and he was still running late and he would be at our house at 4:00. He arrived just before 4:00 and he stated that he was too big to get into the attic crawl space and that another tech was coming to do the drop. In the mean time he looked at the HD DVR box and replaced it. It was in worse shape than the one he replaced.The new tech showed up and due to the insulation in the attic he refused to do the drop from the attic. So I now have a cable running down the outside of my front entry way. By this time it is 7:30pm and the first tech was going to leave the broken box and that I would have to set up an appointment to have someone else come out and replace it. The new drop also included a HD DVR box. By this time the tech was getting mad and when I stated that the replaced HD DVR box was not acceptable because it was in worse shape then the original. He left my house saying he would be back within the hours. He never came back. We went to set up the new drop because he left without setting the new drop up. What did we find no power cord. This was Saturday of Memorial weekend no cable and no one willing to make it right until next week. Customer service, what a joke, when I called to have the technicial come back all I got was if he said he was coming back he will. He didn't.He never came back.

"Jeffrey of Las Vegas, NV",5/24/2009,,"   I lived in Martinez, Ca. from June of 96 until I moved to Las Vegas on Oct. 21st of 08. I was a single father. I had regular cable from Comcast for years and when contacted again and again to install Digital Cable, I said no, I'm fine. At the end of April of 07' I recieved a mailer for Digital for a time with a deal. I excepted and ordered three boxes with the living room being HD. A day or so later, I recieved a box with three ""boxes"" that looked like modems. I called after looking at them and said, "" I'm sorry, but how do I record on these""?I was told that I couldn't record and that they had sent me the wrong boxes because ""they have a warehouse full of those and they are trying to get them out there"". A Tech arrived the next day and exchanged these ""useless"" modem like boxes for a traditional three boxes. He left and I immediately had viewing problems. After about 5 or 6 more tech visits, a Supervisor came to my house in the country and checked everything. I had cable from around the early 60s or earlier and EVERYTHING had to be replaced ""and that the other techs probably knew that"" and didn't want to mess with it. He was very nice and did it all in about an hour and a half. The next year and a half was great and no serious problems except a bad box that my daughter called to be replaced. No questions about bills, boxes or ANYTHING was ever asked of me and I was never billed for anything. I moved to Vegas and had a tech come to pick up the three traditional boxes I had and was told on the phone that I may have an old Zenith box that was junk. I was never, to my knowledge- charged for it but did find it where my daughter had put it in the hall closet and gave that one to the service tech. He then called in and spoke to the person that I had conversations with about my HD and picture not working and he said to tell me that I had three cable boxes that I owed them. I had no idea what boxes he was refering to, except the ""modem"" style 3 from a year and a half ago. I was hung up on about 10 times while calling for my credit refund from my account. I always tried to pay ahead and had a credit balance of about 56 or 57.00. The City of Martinez had to get involved and I was told that Comcast would ""write them off"". A Comcast lady called to tell me this too and when I asked her about my credit refund, she said she would look into it and get back to me. Well, needless to say, no call back, no refund and I am disabled in Vegas and about to buy an house in Sept or Oct of this year. I haven't been able to check my credit and I can't call them anymore due to the stress of all of this. They know that those modem style boxes probably are usless to anyone other than Comcast and I think that if this isn't just ""get even time"", that the tech is in business for himself. I still want my refund and it is just the principle. I would even donate it to charity, but I want my money.He was very nice and did it all in about an hour and a half.

"Marilyn of Boca Raton, FL",5/26/2009,,"On April 20, 2009 continuing to the present date, I have been experiencing rolling ""blackouts"" of internet service that I pay for from Comcast. I have called them 6 times in the last 6 weeks, have had technicians to my home that claim nothingâ€™s wrong, and yet I continue to have denial of service with no explanation from Comcast. Approximately every 5 to 10 minutes, my internet connection is ""cut off"". The TV signal is fine. I continue to pay $30 a month for internet service that is completely unstable with no explanation from Comcast. Every time I am disconnected from the internet, around every 5 minutes, I lose whatever I was working on at the moment. I have lost thousands of dollars being cut off from my online stock brokerage account. There is no way to recover from the losses."
"Mike of Palm Beach Gardens, FL",5/29/2009,,   Comcast Cable is awful.  Since May 22 wire has been unburied exposed wrapped around our home in Evergrene with no date to bury the eye sore and safety hazard with 4 small kids in our home until June 12.  The Comcast representative that drapped the wire on May 22 had told us he would be out the next week to bury the wire.  I have spoken over 8 times to request burial with the Comcast representatives being uncooperative.  22 days for incomplete work to be completed and leave expose wiring above grown is both unreasonable and unsafe!  Comcast was unwilling to provide an earlier date to bury. I am concerned for my 4 small children as this wire is around their playground and the parameter of our property. Please help. 
"M of Denver, CO",5/30/2009,,"I signed up for 1 year promo of cable and high speed internet for $24.95 a month. I should have realized it was a scam. A technician came out a week ago and did the install. Everything was fine. A week later and I can't get Comcast internet to stay online now. I called, did live chat and finally had to reinstall my Cricket USB modem. Wow! Cricket is working and Comcast isn't. I guess it's true that you get what you pay for. I'm just glad Comcast hasn't charged me as much as the other people on here. I'm giving them 2 more weeks and if they can't get it fixed, I'll switch to Qwest. Qwest has a pretty good promo right now too."
"David of Lake Worth, FL",5/30/2009,," They have made it clear, customer service is not a priority. They have also made it clear Comacast can not handle repairs timely or satisfactorily. It has been five days and we still have no clear understanding as to this company is doing to resolve this problem. We have a list of names and history if it would be any help to you. "
"Charles of Tallahassee, FL",5/31/2009,,"   I am an IT professional who is very proficient in Computers and Networking.  I fully understand how this stuff works.  That's why I cannot understand why comcast is so flaky lately.  Their customer service is horrible, but usually I never have to be bothered with interacting with that bunch. Comcast has been pretty good.  I have been a customer for 6+ years, only subscribing to the basic cable internet service for +/-$40 a month.  I noticed about 2 months ago the service was becoming more and more intermittent.  Basically I lose all connection to the internet.  Sometimes the modem does this slow blinking thing that resembles a modem firmware upgrade or ip reconfiguration.  Sometimes the modem looks like it is operating normally, but it cannot connect to any remote server. I would go on and on about my nightmare experiences with the customer service clowns and the ""support techs"", but is gives me a headache just thinking about it.  Plus I know that it is just a big charade that is put on to portray competence and give us the feeling that ""somebody is working on my issue"".  Basically, they need to fix their problems before I decide to go with the less expensive and seemingly more stable DSL solution. What irritates me is that they have the $ to fix it, but they are unwilling or unable to fix it.\ Basically, they need to fix their problems before I decide to go with the less expensive and seemingly more stable DSL solution.

"Randy of San Francisco, CA",6/1/2009,,"The Comcast guy rang my intercom, then proceeded to announce my name, my bill amount for service, etc. I told him stop and I would come downstairs. He then informed me my bill was ""too high"" and he was here to reduce it. I said I was skeptical. He announced my bill would be reduced from $162.20 a month to $119.00 a month if I let them upgrade my package, including a phone line I do not want. Thirty minutes later, he returned claiming I only qualified for the $149 a month because of my ""circumstance"". They came two days later and installed their new equipment. Today, I received the bill: $246.69, not to mention a $5.70 charge for a 911 call. When I called the center, it says wait for your call to be answered, then hangs up. I tried the live chat, who told me I have to talk to someone to ""reduce my services"" in order to lower my bill, which is now almost double where it was before they came to my door. I am in poor physical health, including a bad heart with mitral valve leakage. I can not handle stress. I have been unable to resolve this issue on the phone or online with them and each encounter leaves me so sick I vomit and am unable to eat or even watch the television or use the internet I pay so much for. I also have a witness to all the aforementioned events and I am willing to file suit if it be necessary."
"Jeanene of Oak Park, IL",6/1/2009,,"I can no longer receive Channel 20. The screen informs me that this is a weak or no signal. This is a PBS station; I receive Channel 21 and 11. I contacted Comcast customer service and was told they would send a technician and if it was my problem they would charge me. I could avoid the technician fee if I pay $1.49/monthly. A postcard sent by Comcast informs me WYCC (PBS) will change to be digitally delivered on Basic Service channel 20 and will require a digital receiver or compatible equipment. I purchased a digital TV last year to avoid the need for a converter. I usually watch Channel 20 for quality entertainment and intelligent news coverage, i.e, Charlie Rose. I do not know what to do now."
"David of Aurora, co",6/2/2009,,"This company has been not sending out regular bills to me monthly, which means I get late/disconnect notices and phony late charges. They also have not been posting my payments! I feel my information and or checking account could be compromised. This is very troubling that they can get away with this sort of thing! I have 2 other complaints pending with them as it is! My bill has tripled now! They say I owe them over $140-plus. My monthly bill is $45.00! Times are stressing enough without garbage like this going on! I will be filing for compensation!"
"Alan of Hayward, CA",6/2/2009,,"I have been a long time customer of Comcast Internet and I have noticed some inequities that Comcast is offering involving their Internet service. It appears that in some areas, they are now offering a 12 mbps speed at an introductory offer at $19.99 for 6 months. Then it will return to the $42.95 a month that I am currently spending for only 6 mbps and the new rate will not be available in my area until 12/09 per Comcast representative. When I asked for an adjustment to at least the $19.99 for the 6 mbps, I was told that Comcast has only one base rate. This doesn't seem fair at all. Something needs to be done about this cavalier attitude towards consumers."
"Juan of Arlington, VA",6/2/2009,,"I paid a bill over the internet, and they lost the payment somehow, even though my bank statements clearly show that they deducted the money. I have called the regional office on innumerable times. I have called the national hotline multiple times, and they have told me they could not help me. I have faxed proof of payment 3 times and emailed them once. I have spoken to my bank, and I've had my service disconnected 2 times. This has been going on since March. Comcast doesn't really care and just wants me to pay again. They have really been incompetent and non-existent in this matter. I smell a lawsuit coming."
"Justin of Bloomington, IN",6/3/2009,,"I'm at my mother's house recovering from surgery. We lost cable, phone, and Internet last night at 10pm. They fixed the phone and cable. I got the Internet to work after 4 hours on the phone around 7am. It died before 6pm. I dealt with numerous rude sickos for 4 hours only to have them blame the problem on Vista, even though I never had problems until they started jacking with my settings.They refuse to put my mother's correct SS# on her account and they abuse her every time she has to call over that. They kept confusing us with another account, and telling us that it worked or that we didn't have wi-fi, like we're a couple of brain-damaged 5 year-olds. It worked for two hours, then died again. After being uncommonly evil, they told us that they couldn't get a tech guy out here for 86 hours. This is terrible.If it were their intention to be the worst, most evil, incompetent, sadistic company on this planet I can't think of a single thing they would be doing differently. Since they confused my mother's account with mine in another town (I'm here recovering from surgery) and they jacked with all my settings for 7 hours I know that when I get back home nothing will work there, either. So 8 hours on the phone with these psychopaths and everything is worse than when I first called. This is the 4th of the last 7 days that the Internet has gone out, and it will be another 4 before they get out here"
"Vishal of Mount prospect, IL",6/6/2009,,"I ordered a Comcast high speed internet connection. This was long time back. I went out of town for six months for work related reason and my internet connection setup was never completed. I spoke to Gavan, one of the customer service agent on June 5th 2009 to set up internet connection at my place and had really bad customer service experience with him. He started yelling at me on the call with high tone (high voice). When I asked for supervisor (Michael), Michael also supported him saying, ""I know he was yelling at you,"" and acknowledged that he was standing next to him when he was doing so. Michael, being a team lead never apologized or tried convincing me. Instead, I hear his voice was too supportive for Gavan. I am very disappointed with this call and customer service experience with the Comcast. I would never ever recommend anybody in future to go for this kind of service and end up with bad customer service like this. I know Comcast might not take this as important, as they would lose only one customer but like this, there will be several others who might be the victims of such bad customer service and may think the same way. I am now switching to another service provider. I already have a Comcast modem, (which I paid $60 just for modem + shipping), which I purchased while placing an order. I wanted my money back but Comcast customer service is not even accepting the modem back. I was warned by my friends not to go with Comcast because they had bad experience with Comcast before but it was all my mistake or I would say ""wrong choice"". I don't know how to escalate this to the upper management in Comcast."
"Nicholas of Greensburg, PA",6/6/2009,,"I was out of town on a business trip. I knew there was some kind of issue with my Internet when I could not remotely connect to my home computer. When I returned home from the trip, I was without service on my Internet, phone/fax and television. I called the Comcast number and was told that they would get right back to me with a time that a service technician could look at my service. I waited 4 hours and didn't receive a call. I called back and was told that it would possibly be 3 days until they could come. I asked to speak to a supervisor and explained to him that my office is at my home and I was losing business time related to the outage. He was quite rude. I then drove to the local office and was told again that they would call me to tell me when a representative could provide the service. Twenty-four hours later, no call and no service."
"Gunjan of Edina, MN",6/6/2009,,"I called Comcast to see why one of my cable boxes was not powering on. I was told that it has probably ""fried"" and that they would send out a technician with a new box at no service charge to me. Since the technician was anyway coming out to my place, I requested that they send an HD box as a replacement and not the basic box. Apparently, that is not possible, unless I agree to pay a fee of $15+. However, I could go to the Comcast Service Center and pick it and not have to pay the $15+. I asked why. Apparently, the $15+ covers the gas, etc., that would be incurred by Comcast. That does not make sense. They had already agreed to come out to my place (which would have cost them gas money). So what was the big deal about coming out with an HD box instead of a basic box. They just would not do it. They kept insisting that I should pay for the change of the box if they would bring it out. Finally, I just got fed up with them and told them to send the basic box itself. It's their loss; they would not be making the extra on the HD service every month, in front of which the $15+ is nothing."
"Gordon of Plymouth, MI",6/6/2009,,"Comcast told everybody that we do not have to worry about the change in digital TV mandated by the government. No, we receive a letter saying all TVs need a cable box to receive Comcast TV. This is their box, not the converter. Why do they tell us one thing and change in the future."
"John of Acworth, GA",6/7/2009,,"Comcast is forcing us to add cable boxes to all the TVs in our house.  Currently, our channels go to number 78.  In a few months, basic cable will be limited to channel 27 and below.  What a rip off!  We have TVs in our kid's rooms where they watch shows on channels 62, 63 and 64.  Now, my options are 1) throw away the TVs or 2) pay something like $11 a month for each additional TV (cable box rental plus ""outlet fee"").  I will switch to AT&T as soon as they get the fiber cables run so I can get TV at my house."
"Aravinda of Columbia, MD",6/8/2009,,"I cancelled my Comcast service on 1/26/2009 by returning the equipment to Comcast office here and was told by the lady at the office that the service was officially cancelled as of that date. However, I kept getting bills from Comcast for the next two months. A telephone call revealed that the billing department was unaware of the service being cancelled! Anyway, the customer service representative assured me that the account will be updated to reflect the cancellation and the credit in my account ($90 something) will be refunded shortly. Even after several months waiting and three calls to Comcast, no refund showed up. Finally, on May 24th, I filled out a complaint on their website, supposedly to be looked into by one Rick **, their VP for Customer Relations. Next day, I received a telephone call from Comcast as a follow-up to my e-mail complaint and I was assured by the man that the refund check will be mailed out most definitely by the end of the month. Guess what, there is no check as of today. This is what one gets for paying everyone of their bills on time and being a good customer for six years! What an ungrateful company. I am glad I switched over to FIOS. Anyway, I have also filed a complaint with the Maryland Attorney general's office."
"Dan of Bartlett, TN",6/8/2009,,"I have had nothing but problems since Comcast took over the cable company in my area. They are always down and service is next to garbage! Bring back Road Runner. There was never a problem with them and the prices were much better. Your cost is too much, service is crap."
"Clay of Cartersville, GA",6/9/2009,,"My internet has not been working properly for three months. Every time I call Comcast, they tell me to disconnect the modem and router to troubleshoot properly. I have done this numerous times. The internet is still not working. Comcast sent a technician to troubleshoot the issue. He said their signal was low and he would correct the problem. The internet does not work, again. Problem not solved!I changed the router and modem. Problem not solved. My neighbors say they are experiencing the same issue. I called Comcast and told them that my internet is not working and I would like a credit for the two months that it was not working. They said they will only issue one month's credit. I spoke to two different supervisors, and the last one I spoke with said I could not talk to her manager. She said she was the last step in the resolution process. Total crap! What kind of business is this? I am now cancelling my service with Comcast and going a different route. They have the most terrible service I have ever seen in my life!"
"Cindy of Murfreesboro, TN",6/9/2009,,"I had the triple play service; phone, internet, and TV. I had trouble from day one when I paid $90 to have service connected. Two televisions did not even have the wire needed to hook to the cable. Three outlets were either missing or not screwed in. The cable was laying on the ground in front of my house. To this day I have a cable with two splitters running across my front porch. Comcast told me to be careful that it wasn't kicked. I had to contact Comcast seven times in under one year because service went out. I was told by a supervisor that they would refund the days I was unable to use the phone and other services. She also told me they would fix the installation. None of this ever happened. In fact, because it was a holiday weekend, my daughter who had just gotten home with a newborn baby the day before was home alone with no phone or transportation.This supervisor had been informed of this but insisted I would have to wait several days to get the phone working. I have now canceled the phone service. The next problem I have will go to the authorities of my city as I have documented it all. I have had cable with several companies of many years with no problems. Comcast has the worst installation, equipment and by far the worst customer service of any company I have ever dealt with."
"Christopher of Berkeley, CA",6/10/2009,,"Starting in March 2009, a one-time charge of $40 showed up on our Comcast bill for unreturned equipment. No other explanation was given so I called Comcast. They said it was for a modem they couldn't find which should have been picked up during a service call that had occurred one year before. This was the first time we had heard that a modem was missing and we informed them that we didn't have it and had no reason to keep it since the technician had replaced the old modem with a new one that handled phone service as well.We also explained that it seemed odd to be notified about missing equipment a year after the technician made their visit. They agreed and told us not to pay the $40 and that they would take care of it on their end. Every month since, the charge has continued to show up on my bill. Every month, I call and again they tell me they're sending the forms to get it removed. This has been going on for three months now and I feel they're stonewalling me to get me to pay the fee. If they come back and say they still can't find the equipment I'm not sure what recourse I have. What particularly bothers me about this incident is that the charge showed up without explanation and a year after the supposed incident occurred. I'm sure many customers just pay the fee. When I asked about the bill, one of the telephone representatives acknowledged, ""Oh yeah, we add that so people will call in."" Really? Is this a best practice?"
"James of Newport, NC",6/11/2009,,"When I moved to Jacksonville, Florida for a job, Comcast was the only cable provider. When I signed up, I was not given a modem. Instead, they directed me to a site online where I could order the modem to use. I paid almost $100.00 for the modem. I moved from Jacksonville, Florida in February 2009. Since that time, Comcast has tried to schedule appointments with me twice to pick up the modem that I purchased. They have tried twice now and I informed them not to call me anymore. I wonder how many people have purchased a modem and then give it to Comcast. I believe this is a deliberate scam to acquire free modems to rent to new customers."
"Matthew of Frederick, MD",6/11/2009,,"I just moved to the Frederick area. Since 2001, I have had access to NASA TV since I am a space buff through Dish Network, a local cable company back in Minnesota where I used to live, and DirecTV. I have contacted Comcast multiple times and have got mixed responses. I have been told there are plans in the works, no plans at all, it will be added this year, and just today no information.I am getting very, very upset that a national company won't carry a free channel and will carry foreign channels. I have looked at other cities that have Comcast and some of them have it. Why won't Comcast add it to the lineup of channels in the state of Maryland, which has a NASA center, is anyone's guess?Also, a lot of the time I get a tiling screen or the picture freezes along with audio or the audio won't be there. Also, Comcast doesn't have the HD channels as they claim to have. By my count, not including the local channels, there are 32 HD channels, not near the number they say they do. I have had better experience with Satellite in terms of cost, quality of customer service, variety of channels, basically everything! I laugh at Comcast!"
"Michael of Muskegon, MI",6/14/2009,,"My internet connection and or my cable TV connection have gone out a total of eight times in the last five weeks. Each time, Comcast has sent out a repair person at their convenience, while I get to change my schedule to accommodate theirs, who temporarily fixed it and have plenty of excuses to explain why it won't happen again. They have included the wiring is old and needs to be replaced. The other techs used a technique called ""boot and scoot"" which was explained to me to mean they just splice in a piece of wire and get out as fast as possible. One tech added an amplifier, another removed the amplifier. Another tech told me the modem was bad so I bought a new one. Then I found out that there wasn't anything wrong with the first one but I can't return a modem once it has been opened because it's an electronic item. Another time they sent out a person to disconnect my neighbor because he switched to a satellite network but disconnected mine instead. The excuses, incompetence and breakdowns keep coming but the reliability does not.When I call in, I'm always, without exception, put on hold. During this time, Comcast has the nerve to play recorded messages telling how I'm a highly valued customer and all about the great shows I could be watching if my connection worked. The best part is they also play commercials telling me about other premium channels and services I can sign up for that won't work either but that I can pay more money each month.Iâ€™ve been a customer for over twenty years and yet I get treated like someone whose business they don't need. Maybe that's what I need to do. Three of my neighbors have switched from Comcast to a Dish Network because of their lack of service. I think I will be next but not before I write an editorial to my local newspaper, the college newspaper where I work, the Better Business Bureau, The County Cable Franchise Commission and I purchase a full page of space in the newspaper as well just to make sure everybody gets to see this. I also intend to post this message on any and every internet site that might have an interest in it. I will also look into any state offices that might have an interest in your incompetent performance.Here's a surprise! While writing this, my cable connection dropped out again. That brings the count up to nine times in five weeks. "
"Barbara of Seattle, WA",6/18/2009,,"I signed up for Comcast High Speed Internet at $19.99 per month for one year. This is still their advertised special. I received it at $29.99 per month. I explained that the $29.99 was neither the rate I was quoted nor the advertised rate. They refused to lower the rate. Additionally, the modem that serves both my internet connection and my existing phone service stops working several times per day and must be reset. This is a problem they are unable to fix. I am willing to accept the below par phone service but I feel the $10.00 difference between the advertised high speed internet rate and the billed rate is unfair. No damage, these people just waste time and wear me out."
"Fred of Silver Spring, MD",6/18/2009,,"I am an ex-customer of Comcast Cable TV. Comcast owes me a credit of $52.33 (paid on 2-23-2009) that they refuse to refund to me. I have contacted them numerous times over several months to no avail. They agree I have a credit but refuse to refund it. They asked me to fax them the bank statement proving I sent the payment by Bill Pay. I faxed the bank statement and they told me that they lost it. I faxed it to them 3 times. I think I am getting the ""run-around"". Obviously, this Corporate Giant has no interest in being fair to ex-customers or they are just incompetent and uncaring. "
"John of Atlanta, GA",6/18/2009,,"My cable TV and high-speed internet goes out daily. Outages have not been uncommon in the past but in the last few months the service has really declined. When it is working, I am still not able to purchase on-demand movies most of the time. Comcast's Atlanta customer service center insists that they can only investigate the problem from inside my house, because of the sporadic nature of the issues. But it never seems to go out when they are at my house. But I still booked meetings with them anyway. The fact that it is working when they show up does not stop them from saying they fixed the problems. I think they get evaluated on the number of tickets they close, not on the number of customers they have satisfied. My job does not allow me to sit around the house every time they can schedule a technician for a visit. And because of the repeated complaints from my neighbors, I know this is not just an issue with my house. When I complained to a supervisor in the Atlanta office, John P., I was told that they do not require me to take time off of work because they have technicians that work nights and weekends. But when I asked him to book a weekend appointment for me, he said they were booked weeks out. He also said he is not aware of other complaints. Did he really check? In the past, they received so many complaints from my street that they cancelled the individual service appointment that I had set up and did something at the local switch. That fix lasted about a week.The entire situation is a joke. There is obviously a problem impacting a street full of professionals that do not have the time to play Comcast's ""it is not us, it must be you"" game. I have worked in technology for 20 years and know that they can monitor (either automatically or manually) the traffic in my neighborhood and sniff out the problem. To me it is simply that they have sold more services in an area than they can handle.What am I to do? I am supposed to have high-speed internet for my job (I usually drive to the office at night and weekends when I need to, because of the constant outages). I have tried to turn to the regulatory authorities but unlike the power company, there is no single strong commission in my city or state that will punish them for bad service. The customer service department does not seem to care about their customers. I assume that they will continue to provide ** service until U-verse moves into my corner of the city and provides real competition. I am paying about $120 a month for a service that is sporadic, and for customer service that does not seem to understand the scope of the problem."
"Victoria of Harford, MD",6/19/2009,,"I have moved and had no choice but to take Comcast for my TV services. I would rather choose Direct, but my leasing company would not accommodate my use of the roof for the antenna. I had an initial setup date of 6-17. I received a call on the 13th that my appointment was for the 15. I took the day off and to no avail. Surprise, no one showed up. On the 17th at 6 pm, I had two boxed installed. On the 17th at 9pm, the second box stops working. So I called tech support who could not understand what the issue was. Of course, they gave me another appointment for a time that I would not be able to be home (12 pm to 2 pm). I waited all day on the 18th for someone to come; no one showed. No call either. Today the 19th, I called to schedule someone to come out to the house. They stated that someone showed up on the 18th and there was no answer. Thatâ€™s not true. We were waiting. Now, I have to drive the non-working box to the nearest Comcast site to exchange the box. Hopefully, a new box will work and it is not some other issue. I was told that I would not be reimbursed for my gas that I now have to use."
"Shawna of Pitttsburg, CA",6/20/2009,,"We paid our Comcast service and 2 days after we paid, we were hit with a late fee. We have severe outages that has killed our TV and had no cable for 1 month and we were still required to pay for service they couldn't fix for over a month and had to buy a new TV as a result of their cable not being grounded. To top it all off, they're the only cable company out here. They won't allow another cable company to come out to my city. As I rent, I am forced to have Comcast if I want to watch TV! I thought that a business can not hold a monopoly on a service in CA so that people could have a choice! But not where I live."
"Teresa of Macomb, IL",6/22/2009,,"I called up to get Comcast High-Speed Internet on 6/18. The technician arrived the next day (6/19) to install it, but ended up disconnecting my Dish Network wiring in order to use that to make the cable modem connection. I caught one of his errors while he was there when he disconnected the satellite feed to the room I was in. He indicated he could check to find the live cable feed, but alas, apparently chose not to.After he left, I then found another non-working satellite feed and called Dish Network and they came out on Monday (6/22) to track down the problem. You guessed it, the Comcast technician had disconnected another Dish Network cable to connect the modem. This one I just didn't catch before he left. All in all, I'm very dissatisfied. Not only was I charged $50 to have Comcast High-Speed Internet installed, I am also out the $49 it cost to have Dish send out a technician to resolve the issue your Comcast technician caused.And as you might guess, I am fed up with my Comcast experience and have canceled service (6/21). Someone is supposed to be by Tuesday (6/23) to pick up the cable modem. I am requesting that I don't get billed the $50 for the Comcast installation fee, nor any of the $36.99 initial monthly fee for the Comcast Internet Service. It will be interesting to see if I get a response. At the very least, call it lesson learned and never again will I consider Comcast for anything."
"W.J. of Chicago, IL",6/22/2009,,"Approximately three to four weeks ago, I switched from AT&T to Comcast phone. Since then, the phones, TV and the Internet go in and out or do not work. I have spent four days at home for Comcast to fix their problem, and they will be here tomorrow. Great. I am tired of the Comcast reps saying they are sorry. All of them are sorry. How do you think I feel now that the problems are never fixed?"
"Melissa of Hermitage, TN",6/22/2009,,"With Comcast, the issue is always the same. Something is wrong with service or something has been billed incorrectly and as a customer, I have to call customer service to let them know (I know the number by heart). But when I call customer service, they make me feel as though I've done something wrong in calling them. Today, it was because I didn't press the right number for the correct department. Only trouble is today, for example, I didn't get options when I called. My only options was to complete a customer service survey. After being on hold, the service person wanted to just transfer me around again. This is part for the course with Comcast! Whenever I ask to speak to a supervisor, one is never ever available. I ask for a call back from a supervisor that absolutely has never come in the past. Something just has to be done about customer service. Right now, in my opinion, it is an absolute disservice and it just makes my blood boil to have to contact Comcast. It is like it is completely forgotten that I pay an unreasonable amount of money for cable/internet service, yet when there is a problem, I am the one that has to jump through all the hoops to make it work. I waste valuable time trying to get customer service to help. We go to school online and when the internet is down . . . need I say more? Comcast is the only fast internet available in my particular area. So for now, I'm stuck. Just let one other option become available and I'm out of there!"
"Tamica of Washington, DC",6/22/2009,,"I have been a Comcast customer for 6 years and have had numerous problems. Most recently, Comcast opened up a second account in my name and sent me two bills a month for several months for the same service. After calling every month for several months and having agents tell me I owed money on both accounts, it was resolved by an agent who stated that she would put me on a promotion of $55/month before taxes because of my troubles.This month, I received a bill of over $360 retroactively charging me for internet. The customer service agents claimed I was not charged for internet and my bill should have been billed about $85/month. They claimed my promotion would have only saved me $10/month, which is not a substantial benefit to me, and for such a large corporation as Comcast, it is definitely not a large loss. However, $300 of retroactive charges is a substantial loss to me and a minuscule benefit to Comcast. I want a full credit for these retroactive charges. I was told my bill would be $55. And if I knew my bill would still have been $85 with the promotion, I would have immediately switched to another service provider.Therefore, retroactively billing me is inappropriate, because it is against your agent's representation and Comcast would not have received that money at all had I known I was still going to be charged so much for the service. The customer service agents I've talked to said they don't have the power to fix this. Comcast needs to start spending far less money on their commercials and much, much, much more money improving the accuracy and efficiency of their billing, getting more qualified customer service agents, and improving the quality of their services. And why not give something back to customers by reducing the ridiculously high rates. In the meantime, I'm leaving Comcast ASAP. They've lost yet another customer because of their deficiencies."
"Roy of Panama city, fl",6/24/2009,,"First of all, terrible customer service! This has been the worst cable company that we have ever dealt with. The service comes and goes but mostly goes. When you call (after holding for 30+ min), the representative still cannot resolve the problem over the phone and a service call has to be scheduled which can take up to 1 week. Even after the serviceman comes to fix the problem the next day, it can start all over again. Meanwhile, my bill is never credited as promised and Comcast representative will have no notes from your previous call. The price is said to be cheaper but it should be free since you have so many issues and they are so frequent. Terrible, terrible service as well as customer service! Pay more and go with another company! At least this way, you get to watch TV. I say when my service is interrupted then the monthly bill should be on the company, not the consumer. This causes much undue stress and anger! I don't want to hear ""I'm sorry"" from the company anymore. Fix the problem once and for all!  "
"Shikina of Atlanta, GA",6/29/2009,,"I have been a customer with Comcast for over a year. On June 12, 2009, I found out that there was a notice put on my account by the inner office that will no longer allow me to make payment arrangements. No one could tell me why. All payment arrangements that I have made were honored and paid in full. Therefore, $116.00 was paid on June 13, 2009. To add injury to insult, my service was disconnected on June 26, 2009 without any notice. I was told by a customer service representative that I needed to pay my past due amount by the end of the day on June 26 or a technician would be out the next day to disconnect my service, which in turn could require me to pay a reconnection fee and the entire bill! Of course, I scrambled to make the payment of $129.00 before this predicament occurred knowing that I just made a payment two weeks prior without receiving a bill! The end total that I paid to Comcast for the month of June was $244.00! I would like to inquire why I can no longer make payment arrangements on my account. Is that policy? Comcast has a reputation for poor customer service and unfortunately I have been a victim of that. The economic damage resulted in me paying $244.00 with the course of two weeks. Customer service representatives were threatening to disconnect my service completely if I did not pay the amount due that same day! I have never been late on any payments or payment arrangements that I have set up!"
"Sid of Fremont, CA",6/30/2009,,"Comcast offered a great deal to switch my TV programming from DirecTV to Comcast Digital Cable. When they signed me up, we chose Digital Starter pack with 40 HD channels that included CNN HD and PLD HD, among others. Little that we realize that their service and equipment would be extremely pathetic. They set us up with an HD box with DVR that would literally hang at least 4-5 times a day and would need cold boot every time. Today, 6/29/09, we decided to lug the bulky box to the local Comcast service station in Fremont and got a replacement. When we set up the replacement box today, we no longer received the HD programming line-up that was promised to us as part of the Digital Starter pack (which we locked for one year through a contract, by the way). When I got on the phone and waited for 20 minutes, I gave up and got on a chat session instead. The chat session support person named Ronald told us that I will have to upgrade my package in order to get the HD programs that I until a couple of hours ago (i.e. before exchanging my cable box, which was due to Comcast's bad equipment and not due to our volition) we were receiving. The service support person would be of no help in restoring our programming and directed us back to a 1-800 number to again go through the ordeal. This has resulted in extreme frustration, mental agony and pain. Comcast charges us for the services and then decides to change terms without letting us know. And if a consumer does that, they will slap us with large fees for ""violating the contract.â€ This is totally unacceptable. In my profession, I have to rely on business and other world news. I had to miss all that because I spent hours trying to resolve a situation that was a result of bad and unethical practice of Comcast. It is tough to quantify the economic implications of such deeds of large corporations."
"Ann of Fredericksburg, VA",7/1/2009,,"I called Comcast in May, because my internet was out. They scheduled someone to come out. I took off work and was home when the technician came out. He checked the internet in my home, changed a splitter, and told me that my signal was low at the outside box. He said that he would send someone out to boost the line. The service remained slow and/or not working.The first of June it went out again. I called, took off work, and the technician came. Said I had a low signal and that he would send someone out to boost the line. The same thing, slow service and or not working at all. At the end of June, it went out again. I called, took off work, technician said that the line has a low signal, he would send someone out to boost the cable. The next day, I received a bill from Comcast that was for the service calls to my home even though that problem was on their end. (They had told me that I would me credited for the time without service. I called and was told that I did not have to pay the service charge and that they would correct my bill. For me to call in a couple of days to see how much I owe).Yesterday, the cable was out again, I called, they said that they would send a technician out. I told them that it was unnecessary because the outside cable line just needs to be boosted. They said that they did not see it on my records and that I would have to take off another day of work and await the technician. I asked to speak to a supervisor. She said that everyone was busy and I left my number, no one called. I called again today. The supervisor said that a work order for cable boosting was never put in and that I had to have a technician come out again. I told her that I had a copy of the statement that the last technician had stated that the problem was the low signal. I told her that I could fax it to her, I also had the phone number of the technician. She said that she was sorry, but that I would have to take off another day of work and have a technician come out. I have never been treated so badly. I am changing cable companies."
"Veronica of Pikesville , MD",7/2/2009,,"I have been without internet since last Thursday (6/25). After numerous calls to Comcast, they agreed to send a technician out on Wednesday, 7/1. They agreed to call when they were 30 minutes away and did call at 1:45 pm. I got home at 2:00 pm and waited until 2:30 to call Comcast to find out where the tech was. The woman I spoke to told me their tech had already come and that I wasn't home. When I told her that I was told I would be given 30 minutes from the time of the call, she said she got in touch with the tech and he would be on his way back to my home before 3pm. At 3:15, I called Comcast again and was on hold until 4 before I was told the tech would not be coming and the person I spoke to before was incorrect when they told me the tech was coming back. Then I was told I would have to reschedule for Monday, 7/6! When I finally spoke to a supervisor, after my 3rd try because I was hung up on and then pushed back to the main menu, she basically told me that they aren't allowed to give 30 minutes and that if they call, they could be in my driveway calling. What? It's a bunch of ** and I still have no internet! I hate Comcast."
"Ken of Nolensville, TN",7/4/2009,,"My Comcast May and June monthly billing statement both has $0.00 balance instead of credit of $50.84. Payment received is equal to $0 instead of $50.00 payments. New charge is $0 and thereâ€™s no payment due. When I called Comcast to request billing statements with my monthly charges, previous balance and payments, I was told by a Monica that Comcast will not provide such statements, but instead to log in online to check my account balances. Possible fraud - Comcast may not be presenting the full balance of my account. For example, Comcast can easily turn my credit balance into balance. Further, by not listing monthly charges, I may be overcharged for their services."
"Chris of San Francisco, CA",7/5/2009,,"I contracted Comcast for the price of $29.99 a month, going up after the end of July. The package I got is a series of paid programs and repletion of the same movies, if any. My TV is 6-month-old, and it has HD installed. Nevertheless, in the last two weeks when I change channels, it is very slow and time-consuming. I am planning to cancel my membership on Monday and use a converter box to get more channels. I know for a fact that a lot of people have returned their boxes and cancelled Comcast. This corporation is greedy and misleads the customers like me."
"George of Sonora, CA",7/6/2009,,"We recently subscribed to the next higher step of programs through Comcast cable service. What is extremely annoying is that the channels they provide purposely turns up the volume on commercials. They are doing this purposely, as the sound will definitely increase once the commercial has started. As far as I'm concerned, this is a flagrant act of invasion of privacy. I haven't confronted Comcast about the problem yet, but I can almost guarantee that they will have some excuse for not being able to do anything about it."
"Renee of Detroit, MI",7/7/2009,,"I only purchased high-speed internet through Comcast, but decided to bundle with another company. They cancelled the account and mailed a box to me so that I could return the modem. The box did not come with further instructions, just the UPS return label. I placed the modem in the box and took it to the UPS store on April 1, 2009. I received a bill for $66 shortly after, but the rep assured me that the charges would drop off once the modem was returned. A few weeks later, I got another bill. So I called and the rep asked when I had mailed the package and what the tracking number was. I did not have it on me at the time, so he told me to call back and provide it. I did the next business day, but this rep said, ""We don't need the tracking number; we got it already because we gave it to you!"" She assured me that the charge would be adjusted off once the box was scanned. The next month, I received another bill from Comcast and a collections letter from a company they hired regarding the $66. I called Comcast on 6/6/09 and the rep told me to go to my nearest customer center and give them the receipt. I did that, but the rep at the center said he couldn't help me because the modem number is not on the receipt. I tried to make it clear that I returned the modem in the box provided to me, not a brick! He again stated he couldn't help me and suggested I call their customer service number and speak with a supervisor! Here I am in a customer service center being told to call customer service! I called and requested to speak with a supervisor, but the rep outright refused! She stated the first thing that needed to be done was a box research. She completed the forms and told me I'd be contacted within 14 business days. I know that the box is sitting in some warehouse and hasn't been scanned yet! My best friend works for Comcast and he just so happens to scan returned equipment in their warehouses! I informed him of the situation and even provided him with the delivery date, time, and the person who signed for it. He knows the person that signed for the package and stated he would handle it. A week later, he called me and told me everything was taken care of. For some reason though, I wanted to be sure. So I called Comcast 7/7/09 and the rep told me that there was still a balance and I was sill in collections! I demanded a supervisor, but the rep told me to speak with the collections department. I called collections and they wanted to do another box research. I refused to be put off and wait another 2 weeks with no results. I again requested a supervisor, who noticed that a box research was put in on 6/6/09 but nothing had been done about it. He suggested I go to a customer service center and I informed him that I did and was turned away! He took down all of the information that I had to provide and promised to follow up with me. Hopefully, something gets done soon because this is affecting my credit. This is not fair!"
"A of Atlanta , GA",7/7/2009,,"I have tried to set up Internet with Comcast for more than a week now. They are insisting that they need to send someone out to the high-rise I live in, in order to restart the service. However, when I had first moved to the area (and into the same building) the service was started over the phone since I had a Comcast modem and router already. Amazing how 6 months later, I can't find 1 competent customer service person to put in the request to restart the service. They have given me 4 different dates to start the service and yet 1 week later, I still don't have service.I have spent 3 hours on the phone with them and was told that the manager, Forest **, is in an all day meeting and has no replacement. Unfortunately, in the neighborhood that I live in Atlanta, GA, there is no alternative internet service provider, either Comcast or no internet. Furthermore, the consumer protection agency in GA is largely nonexistent and they won't process the complaints they've been receiving regarding Comcast."
"Kristen of Joppa, MD",7/8/2009,,"Comcast are liars. I've been lied to twice about promotions I was getting. The first, I had a promotion for 12 months and for some reason, they ended it in 10. When I talked to multiple customer service people, they had no idea why someone would stop the promotion after 10 months, but could never help me so I canceled. About a year later, I joined again. I spoke to and chatted with (and even saved the transcript) multiple people at Comcast who assured me if I kept Comcast, I would be able to get my promotions back. After chatting and talking with someone today, they would not give me the promotion even though I told them verbatim what was said to me in the chat. I've tried to get agreements from them in writing but they won't send you anything because their whole company is ran on lies to their customers. If they send you something in writing, they might have to actually stick to the agreement! But try canceling something while you have an agreement with them and you will get penalized!"
"D of Rogers, MN",7/8/2009,,"We bit on the intro offer of digital phone service. We received a call at 9.30 AM, Friday, July 3, saying they would be at our residence in 15 minutes (Notice: no advanced notice they were coming). The installation was to take 45 minutes. After 3 hours and 30 minutes with two technicians, we told them to leave. We had very limited phone service when they left. (1 and 1/2 phones working). Oh, and by the way, we couldn't use our security system that goes through the phone system. Not long after that, we had no land line phone service (By the way, the technicians switched some of the wiring in the house and dropped at least three previously working telephones).Calls on Monday, July 6, said we would get a call to schedule service, never mind, we were out of land line service. Tuesday, brought a round of discussion with a live-on-line chat. We got a ticket number, and found out we needed to teach the Comcast representative how to use English. Thereâ€™s still no call and still no action. Tuesday evening, we called, rank and file said the next open work slot was Friday, 10-12, one full week after the start of this debacle.Trying a different number at Comcast, we talked to rank and file and got the same stories, ""our records show you have service, and this is not an out of service situation."" We demanded an escalation. 3 and 1/2 minutes later, we got to talk to a management member (of video services, when we were working on a voice problem). Video said they would send the request to scheduling, to get us on the schedule for Wednesday. The manager mentioned some credits - well at least we have a manager phone number.There is a rule of fives, or rule of sevens in business: it takes X minutes to get new business, X minutes to keep business, X seconds to lose a customer, and X years to get a customer back. I cannot believe the hoops we are being put through. I cannot believe the lack of support we received. I can suggest that any new business be tightly watch and performance measurements be built in before switching to Comcast Voice.Well, we have video and internet also, this died last month - my, my, it was a failed (fried) connection in the road side service box. We didn't see the credit there. Isn't it lovely to spend money on Shack and Stein, but not take care of customers? Beware."
"Anna of Fairfax, ca",7/9/2009,,"My internet service went out on June 28. It came back on briefly June 29. I called and reported it on June 30. I have a home office and I was unable to work without internet. I was told that Comcast could not come out until July 2. Comcast came out, reviewed the wiring in my house, and said that the problem was up at the street at the pole. The technician told me that he would report the problem and someone would be out that afternoon to fix it. The next morning, July 3, I still had no service. I called and I was told that no one was scheduled to come out and that they couldn't come out until later that week. I paid the man to help me because I have a home office and couldn't work. He found someone to come out between 1pm and 5pm on July 3.I waited and called Comcast on 5/4/30 and was told that they would still be there by five o'clock. At 5:40pm, I called Comcast and I was told they couldn't get there until 6:45pm. I was very upset because July 3 was a holiday and my day off from work and I had spent it waiting for Comcast to show up. I asked them to come Saturday morning at 10am instead. Comcast came on July 4 and fixed the internet up at the street. I called Comcast today to complain about the service I had received. I was told that they would give me a credit of $10.71 for my loss of internet service for the week. I asked to speak to this person's manager.After being put on hold for 20 minutes, Christine ** came on the line. She told me that she could give me $10.71 of credit for internet service. When I said that was not enough for the pain and suffering, loss of income and various inconveniences of spending hours and hours of time on the phone, she said she would give me a credit of $27.99 for one of the service calls. I was shocked. I asked her if she meant that I had to pay for these service calls of Comcast coming out to fix their equipment. She said, yes, I had been charged for two service calls at $27.99 each and she was willing to give me a credit for one of them.When I insisted that was not adequate, she agreed to credit me for both service calls because it was Comcast equipment that was at fault. I lost a week's worth of work and hours of time dealing with Comcast. They made no effort to compensate me for my time, energy, and loss of income. They were unfriendly, uncooperative, and unwilling to offer decent, honest service. I believe they should have serviced their equipment immediately the day I called. And if they couldn't do it, they should have called me and let me know that they can't make it on time."
"Mark of Ellicott City, MD",7/10/2009,,"The appointment with Comcast to repair my internet access was scheduled from 8-11 am on 7/12/2009. Comcast did not show up, so at 11:00, I called to find out why. And it took quite awhile to get an answer, but they eventually said the tech would be there soon. While I was talking with Comcast, the tech called at 11:07 followed by a call from the dispatcher at 11:11 and these two messages were routed to my voicemail. When I hung up with Comcast at about 11:15 and listened to the dispatchers message, I learned that my appointment was now canceled because I did not answer the tech's call at 11:07.For the next six hours, from 11:00 to 5:00, I repeatedly called Comcast to explain that I didn't answer the 11:07 call because I was talking to them about their missed appointment. I was told many things (the tech will call you back; you're next on the list; the dispatched will call in 15 to 30 minutes; he'll be there in 1/2 hour; a supervisor will call; he'll definitely be there before the end of the day), all of which turned out to be false. I wasted nine hours on a beautiful summer Sunday afternoon waiting on Comcast. And they never did show up."
"Marionetta of Nashville, TN",7/11/2009,,"I put a call into Comcast on July 9, 2009 after I heard my 6-month old kitten scratching behind my living room chair. When I looked, he had pulled out the extra cable the technician left, at my request, for me to use when I got the containers in the room in its proper places in my apartment and set up my living room the way I want it. I had just moved to a new apartment in the same building I lived in. I asked him to roll it up and put it behind the entertainment center so the kitten doesn't get tangled up in it and choke or get hurt. I told the rep to tell the technician that there is no phone number to call me and just to come out, I will be waiting for him. At 6:15PM, I called to see what happened to him, that he did not come out. The answer, ""He called and got no answer, so he did not go out."" This goes on every time I call for any reason, like in April 2009 telling them the day I will be moving to transfer my account to the new apartment. What did they do? They sent a guy out to pick up my modem. That is how I found out that my internet was cancelled, but not by me. I told them to turn it on again and do not charge me for the reconnect, that I did not tell them to disconnect. Also, to send someone out to put the cable for the internet from the living room to the back bedroom. They did that with no problems.I have no phone and use a neighbor's. She is constantly called by Comcast to speak to me and she tells them that I do not have a phone and only use her phone when I need it. She also told Comcast to stop calling her about my service. They refused because if they called me on July 10 and got no answer, it was because they called her. Tell Comcast to remove any phone number from my account and that they are not to call any number I call from because I am now going to go to a pay phone and call them."
"Norma of San Leandro, CA",7/13/2009,,"I haven't been able to watch the free shows that are on demand since I had the cable. I like to watch certain programs when I'm at my boyfriend's house or my mother's because it seems it's the only way I can watch it. I am tired of not being able to watch it at my own place! I called a number of times and tried to do some process over the phone to update my box and nothing gets fixed. I am never really home since I work full time and have a son. We constantly have a number of things to do after I get off work. I took the time to make an appointment so someone could come out and fix the problem. My appointment was on Sunday, 07/12, at 4 to 6 and I even received a phone call from a representative confirming that I would be home. I called at 5:45 p.m. because I didn't see anyone arrive and they said the person had just left their last job and were on their way. The technician never showed up! I then called and spoke to other representatives on the phone and they said the worker came out and fixed the problem. I'm sorry but I have to say that is **! The tech has to be some lazy irresponsible lying worker who should not work if he doesn't like his job. I don't see how he showed up and fixed the problem and didn't take the time to come to my apartment and see if he really fixed the problem. I don't know if that's how you guys run your business? I hope you guys can assist me when fixing my issue because I'm really at the point where I am going to another cable company. I don't want to but it seems I have no other choice since all I'm getting is the runaround. Your employees are not doing their job. The techs are lying and saying they came out to an appointment and don't do it. They probably go home because they sure don't come out to see their clients. I am very upset because I don't like to deal with issues as little at this that turn as big like this one. When I take time from my work to file a complaint like this, something is wrong and I believe a customer shouldn't have to go this far."
"Hanna of Bellevue, WA",7/13/2009,,"Comcast has consistently stopped working in neighborhood. They also have technical problems and expect me, their customer, to wait hours for a solution. They can never give me a time frame of when it will be fixed. I am always told, ""We'll get to it when we can."" What kind of response is that?! It tends to happen when I have homework or a term paper due online. Even right now, it was down for 20 minutes and that made me turn in my homework 20 minutes late. This is absolutely unacceptable. I mean I can understand once or twice, but this is a constant problem. Comcast needs to get their act together."
"Rick of San Jose, CA",7/14/2009,,"On the Comcast TV website, they list basic cable with list of channels you would receive. I subscribed to that now and do not get the channels they listed. I called customer service and they changed the channels listed, but for $14.30 a month, you can get a long list of channels. Now, you cannot buy that service unless you upgrade to the digital service for $29.99 for 6 months, then $59.99 after that! It's false and misleading advertising!"
"Dallas of Loveland, CO",7/15/2009,,"Both my wife and I moved on June 04, 2009 due to us serving a lady whom lived below us with an order of protection and the landlord gave us a notice to quit when she was served and we lived there for three years. Now, it just so happens that the lady works as a dispatcher for Comcast Cable. Both my wife and I are on disability and so when we went to Comcast the beginning of June 2009, we asked for a lower rate for our phone, internet, and cable.They refused to lift a hand to give us a cheaper rate or package. My wife and I then received a flyer from Comcast saying that we could get all 3 services for $99.00 a month for two years. They docked on till we are where we are now. And still they have yet to tell us what our bill is for July 2009. However, they want us to sign a two-year contract online and we have been Comcast customers for three years now. We will not sign the contract till they tell us what our bill will be. With this special package, they say that you receive $100.00 cash back and yet they beat around the bush and refuse to work with us. There are a lot of games going on. And then we also noticed that there has been an illegal tap on our phone line and we have a right to know why and they will not tell us why.The Jeff ** claim to have done an internal investigation into us, having a restraining order on one of their employees; however, they treated us terribly and he really made accusations and really it was not right. He even accused us of making a scene when we paid our bill and we made no scene whatsoever. Now, they are trying to cover all this up. We have rights and the games that these men are playing, well, it is just not right. What part of fixed income are these people at Comcast not hearing? We just want something done about this. And the illegal wire-tap my wife has been going through and now me, through a stalking ex-husband, and it has been going on for years now. What can we do about all this? For I know that we have rights! Thank you for your time."
"Ali of Cherry Hill, NJ",7/17/2009,,"I had the three services for Comcast cable, phone and internet. We did have a service for four (4) days from 7/14 till today, and we donâ€™t know till how long. The problem is that we signed contract with them, it will end on 2/10. I think this way they can impeach the contract and we can stop the service because there is no service right now. They want to charge us $150 to stop the service. We need your help, you can check with Comcast. Thank you."
"Vahid of Moraga, CA",7/18/2009,,"I relocated about 1 month ago, and since I relocated, I had a nightmare experience with Comcast. I have all my services with them: phone, internet, and cable services. For 4 days, I had no services at all. I had technicians four times at my house and for each visit, I lost a day of work and income. Then they connect the cable, and it takes 3 weeks to make it work for a day. But this time, I lost all my e-mail accounts with saved mail, address book, and all valuable memories. And for 6 days, I couldn't send or receive e-mail. Now they created a new account for me. However, I lost all the data I had saved in Comcast. This is a nightmare."
"Rahul of San Jose, CA",7/18/2009,,"Misleading to sign-up for a new service  I was promised certain channels after specifically asking and confirming for those. And when I signed up for the service, I did not get them. Customer service after that was horrible, extremely rude."
"Richard of Leauge City , TX",7/20/2009,,"In May of 2008, we moved into our new home in League City, TX. Money being tight due to the move, we opted for the Comcast economy package. The economy package consisted of a digital phone, basic cable, and cable internet. The entire package was to cost $79.99 a month. We signed up for the service and the Comcast contractors installed the necessary equipment in a timely manner.The cable television and phone worked as described; however, a test of the internet connection by several online speed tests revealed that the internet connection was lower than a dial up modem - less than 23 k. I contacted Comcast who, in turn, scheduled a contractor to come and diagnose the problem. A week later, a tech came out, dug around, stated that he found the problem, fixed it and left the location. After he left, I ran the speed test and found that the speed as the exact thing, 23k. I contacted Comcast minutes after their contractor left, and was informed that the contractor would not be sent back to our home, and that we would be put back on the bottom of the list waiting for another contractor to pick up the job. No biggie. About another week passed and another contractor showed up and went through his procedure and said that the signal coming into the house was weak, that he would notify Comcast that they needed an external cable repaired and he left. Two weeks passed and I called in regards to the matter. I was informed by a nice lady on the phone that the cables had been checked, that they were deemed serviceable, and that I had subscribed the economy package, hence the reason for the 23k signal. I informed the customer service rep that had I known that, I would have never signed up for the service. I did not believe that 23k is anywhere near reasonable for a digital cable internet speed. I recognized the statement for what it was, an excuse, and decided to terminate my service. Lesson learned.I packed up the electronics and headed to my local Comcast store, waited in line to turn in my equipment, and finally made it to the clerk. I told the clerk that I wanted to terminate my service. I was given a bill for the month of service, and three trouble fees of $25 each. Of course, I inquired about the trouble fee for attempting to fix their own problem to no avail, but I got the blank stare. I learned a lesson for $150+, so please feel free to take advantage of the lesson that I have learned. It's bought and paid for."
"Philip of Stockton, CA",7/20/2009,,"I received a letter on 7/17/09 stating, ""Our records indicate you are currently receiving full access to Comcast's On Demand service which extends beyond the scope of what your Cable TV subscription allows. As a Standard with Premium customer, you will no longer have full access to On Demand effective August 25, 2009."" It then states they have a ""variety of package options available to choose from."" The bottom of the letter offers an ""Upgrade to Digital Preferred package"" at an unspecified cost. Our present package is called ""Digital Premier"" There are no specifics anywhere. What are we getting that we're not supposed to? Why the change now after 3 years as a subscriber at $179.56 per month.I called the 800 number, spoke with ""Randell"". She stated we were only the 2nd customer to call on this. I asked her the above questions. She said she had no answer. I pressed the issue, asking, ""How can you take away something without saying what it is? You must know what you are going to remove."" She put me on hold to talk to her supervisor. She came back on to say ""We think it may be Howard Stern."" As rude as it may sound, I had to laugh. ""Please take him - but I can't believe what you're saying"". She said they were just guessing and no one knew what the letter was about.Comcast has a cable monopoly here in Stockton. We cannot get satellite as we are in an apartment complex and trees block access. I firmly believe that we are targeted for this as the letter we got was addressed to Philip ** or current resident. Our account is in my name and has been for over 3 years. Why the ""or current resident""?"
"Katie of Alexandria, VA",7/21/2009,,"I moved into a basement apartment in a row house and needed to set up internet. I contacted Comcast as there was still equipment in the basement from Comcast from the last resident. They were initially unable to understand that it was a basement apartment in a private home, not an apartment building. After putting me on hold repeatedly, they told me to ask my landlord if I could be part of their account. I did and my landlord prefers separate accounts as the apartment is completely separate. I called Comcast back and it took half an hour to explain to Pontsho (who did genuinely try to help me, but had to continually put me on hold to ask her supervisor) that I live in a basement apartment and need to just reactivate the same service that someone else had been using for the last year. Finally, they told me the only way that they could recognize a separate apartment at the same physical address was if I faxed over a copy of something that had been mailed to me so that they could see that the post office accepted the address. It was Friday and I couldn't fax until Monday, so I had to wait. In the meantime, Pontsho even called me back to check the progress of faxing, as she did want to help me and was making a real effort.Monday, I faxed several bills, etc., that showed my address as accepted by the post office. I called 4 hours later, as they had not contacted me, and had to explain the entire situation over again to Neil. He again told me that they no longer offer separate accounts at the same physical address, to which I replied that that was why Comcast had requested that I fax the information. After being put on hold repeatedly and told the same thing over and over, I told Neil that I wanted to speak with a supervisor. He tried to convince me not to, but I insisted. He put me on hold several more times, then told me that all the supervisors were busy and that if I wanted to talk to one, I could get a ""ticket number"" and they would call me back by the end of the day. It was 8:15 pm. If they had not been able to give me any service, they should have told me immediately. Apparently, no one knows what their true policies are and there is no consistency. Every time I have tried to get Comcast in the past, there have been similar issues. I will not be a Comcast customer again."
"George of SonoraC, CA",7/21/2009,,"We upgraded our program to the next highest level of channels. The sound when commercials are on is deliberately increased, and on multiple channels not just one offender. This happens every day, and especially late at night. They have disturbed our sleep on several occasions, woke us up on at least one dozen occasions. I believe this is an invasion of privacy, and they should be stopped. "
"Rodolfo of San Carlos , CA",7/23/2009,,"The appointment with Comcast to repair my cable access was scheduled from 2pm to 4pm on 7/23/2009. Comcast did not show up, so at 4:10pm I called to find out why. It took quite awhile to get an answer, but they eventually said the tech called at 3:30pm. I learned that my appointment was now canceled because I did not answer the tech's call at 3:30pm. I wasted 2 hours off work waiting on Comcast. And they never did show up. Poor tech service and even bad to worse customer service. I would not recommend Comcast to anyone."
"William of Tyrone, PA",7/24/2009,,"We have been customers of Comcast and their affiliates for well over 10 years. They are constantly the only service in the area (which is a monopoly and highly illegal) and they exploit that fact to their fullest extent. The service is poor at best. When there is an outage in the area, they know this as it is logged in their system. This means that their system should automatically issue a day's credit for the service that we couldn't receive. Do you think they would actually do that? Not a chance! When the billing arrives, there is no clear way to understand the billing with all of their 'taxes and fees' that they attach to our bill. You would have to have a 6-year Degree in Economics to even attempt to understand what they are actually charging (not kidding). When you first sign up, they offer you a 'promotional price' that is either six, 12 or 24 months. However, they do not state the length or amount of the promotion remaining on your bill at any time. This means that when you see a bill that is 50% higher than it was the month before, you would understandably freak out. When you call them, they give nothing but excuses, say that they can't give you another promotion for 90 days and that you would have to pay full price for 90 days. And then, they would look into what packages they could offer you at that time. While doing so, they attempt to transfer you many times to someone who has no idea of what they're doing if it is not in their script to read to you. Everything from outright lies, to blaming the customer and claiming that everything is computer-automated and that there's nothing they can do about your issues. In other businesses, you receive price breaks the longer you are with the company in question. For example, if you are a customer for 2 years, you would receive a certain percentage off of your bill. If you are a customer for 5 years, you would receive a larger discount. What they are doing is giving you one price to get you in the door and then raise the price at will after that. In any other business, this is called, 'bait and switch' and is highly illegal in our state. If you, as a customer, contact any company with an issue, they would bend over backwards to do anything to satisfy you in following the old adage, 'The customer is always right.' Does Comcast follow the same adage? Obviously not. That's why you are reading this post. We have done some research and have some numbers for you if you are in Pennsylvania. To contact Comcast's Philadelphia office, you would call 1-(215) 665-1700. Ask to speak to Brian Roberts (COO) or his assistants. If that does no good, consider contacting the United States Department of Consumer Protection. The Harrisburg office is at 1-800-441-2555. If you are not living in Pennsylvania, a quick Google search should give you the local corporate office for Comcast and then also the Department of Consumer Affairs. We could all join together as one voice and tell Comcast once and for all that they are not allowed to treat us the way that they have been and we will not allow it to happen anymore."
"Brian of San Francisco, CA",7/24/2009,,"You need to train your employees on how to interface with clients. I have had three issues within a month with Comcast workers. Firstly, I got a call from Comcast warning me to order a ""digital converter"" or my TV would no longer work. I ran the video department for Moscone Center, so I know that was not a problem with cable TV using 75ohm coaxial cable signals. But the Comcast employee tried to convince me to order the box, and I said if it was free, you could mail it to me. Obviously, it is not needed and I have not opened the package. Secondly, my channel 3 (NBC) developed an audio problem wherein the audio only broadcast on the right channel and nothing on the left. A technician listened for his self and agreed that it was not something he had ever seen or could fix. He suggested I call for credit starting July 1, 2009 when the problem started. Then he changed the diagnosis in order to charge for a home visit and reported that the problem was my TV monitor instead. Thirdly, now I have crackling sound on Channel 3 NBC, but also, Channel 7 ABC plays background music but there is no dialogue on certain shows. I called to offer sending you a digital capture .mpg movie of the problem. I have made a living troubleshooting AV problems for 40 years, and I have eliminated any problem in my own equipment. When I called today to report the new problem, I spoke with ""Tanisha"" and she was very rude and defensive. She suggested that I did not understand AV equipment and tried to sell me service insurance. So one Comcast employee didn't understand the rabbit-ear versus cable-ready issue but he represented Comcast technical support; another made a home visit, which I was told was free, and then falsified documents contrary to what he told me the actual problem was (and told me to get credit because it was a cable problem); and now, a third employee told me that I would be charged again if the technician returns to look at the same problem. I am paid much more than your service people, because I troubleshoot all the major convention video engineering problems at Moscone. I don't like being lied to and being charged for inadequate service. You need to train your people on how to deal with the public. I have already tested your cable signal on various TV monitors, and it is not an SAP setting adjustment. Your technician came here and agreed with me but then filled out paperwork saying it was my equipment causing the audio problems. Our homeowner association is discussing this issue with other neighborhood groups, and we are switching to Dish DirecTV."
"C. of San Francisco, CA",7/24/2009,,"I subscribed to Comcast at $64.06/month. This monthly charge has consistently increased over the years although the quality of channels offered has not. What I am complaining about more than the channel offerings is that Comcast devotes a large chunk of channels to infomercials between either 11:30PM or midnight, up to 7AM the following day. I have complained directly to them about why since beginning of July, they have extended the infomercial time slot through 7AM on a channel I used to be able to watch beginning at 6AM prior.The Comcast rep told me that I must go in person to the local Comcast office and place my complaint since it's a local issue. This is unacceptable to me and solves nothing. In my opinion, the Comcast rep could have forwarded my email complaint to the local office. But the main issue is how could Comcast get away with occupying so many channels with infomercials? I and other clients are paying for the ability to watch these channels and it's not fair that Comcast derives profits from the infomercials while we are at the mercy of Comcast as to when and what we can watch. Thank you."
"Rashmi of Houston, TX",7/26/2009,,"This is a scam, elderly abuse and fraud. They are complicating the accounting methods and then correcting it over the phone and changing it after we pay and then keeping that extra money for their pocket. I got a promotional price of $29.99 per month for 6 months, which comes to about $38 per month for 6 months. But somebody in accounting is reversing after correcting the paid bill and showing the balance in the next bill. I called again and after 15 minutes of talking to their supervisors, it is corrected to $38.00 and the supervisor said, â€œOkay, now it is corrected so you can mail your payment and there will remain no balance in your account.â€ I received a bill showing past balance of $89.07 and new charges of only $17.69 instead of $38.00; then, itâ€™s showing a credit of $36.02, but it made a total due of $106.75. Very tricky accounting. They are cheating the elderly who do not understand simple accounting.I have been sending $38 per month, so how do I owe $106.76 now? It should be about the same amount of $38.00. This has been happening every month for the last 4 months and the supervisor corrected the amount over the phone and said to send that payment of $38 and I will owe nothing and we are even. Then the new bills arrived and showed no corrections. They are reversing it after the correction, cheating, and tricking. The same thing has been happening with AT&T. If you do not check, they will take your money and they got away with that. Strange thing is that the supervisors, accountants, and customer service all belong to one group and they are all crooks stealing from customers for their pockets. I rather blame Comcast for billing and accounting fraud. Thanks."
"Bonnie of Peachtree City, GA",7/26/2009,,"I am very angry right now. I spent a lot of money at Comcast adding a router, adapter and installation. My brother's XP desktop had the adapter and it kept losing the signal. The first technician came here and changed some settings, changed my password and couldn't manage to keep the computer connected. He said we would have to go to Intel and follow their instructions, left and said he was going to contact his supervisor and get back to us as ""I was not going to fool around with technical stuff I did not understand."" I called and a second technician came out. He happened to be the one that made the initial installation and had had a hard time. The computer is older and slower. I tried to explain to him that the computer would not hold the signal and what the first technician had done and said. He stated that he remembered the computer and since my other computer was working okay, it was not Comcast's problem. He never looked at anything. Comcast set up the settings, not me and the first technician changed stuff and I don't know what he did. My son looked into the diagnostics and found that the computer had been set up for a corporate network connection and I had to disable that. I did not set it up that way and either the installer of the adapter or the first technician that came the other day did that. The second technician made me feel stupid and didn't even take the time to look at anything. My son was the one that found the problem for me, as the computer had worked fine previously. All of a sudden, we started getting a message that said ""we would get a better connection if the adapter were plugged into a high speed port"". That message had never occurred before and that is when we started having problems. We may have never understood what was wrong if my son had not been here. I'm just very disappointed as the first technician's supervisor never got back to us, the problem was not written up properly, and the second technician wouldn't even look. I don't want either of them at my house again. I also hope that from now on we get better service."
"Karen of Califon, NJ",7/26/2009,,"On Thursday, cable box died. I called Comcast who sent out a tech on Friday at 2. (They said he would call but he never did.) He replaced the cable box, but it needed an HDMI cable, which of course, I didn't have. So he suggested I buy one online and in the meantime, he used RCA cables. No video. He fooled around with my hook ups and my Harmon-Kardon receiver for over 1 hour and finally got picture. He left. I turned off TV to work. I went to turn on TV. No video. I called Comcast. Customer service said they would send someone because I should have been given an HDMI cable since I pay for HD receiver. Wow! All day Friday, no one. Saturday, no one. I called at noon. ""Okay, we'll tell dispatch this is the 2nd call and make it priority."" On Saturday 9pm, nada. I called and heard a message telling me I am scheduled for a tech on Monday between 2-5! I asked to speak to a supervisor, explained my concerns and he hung up on me! I called back and again asked to speak to a supervisor. I got his name first, Aldo, although he tried to talk over me and get my information (for the 5th time today to verify!). I explained my concerns and he tried to talk over me in his macho angry voice like I was wrong, and said HDMI cables are not provided and if I couldn't be there Monday, would I like to reschedule!? I calmly, yet angrily, said, ""No, tomorrow and I would like credit for the days without service."" He said that it can only be done after the technician states the problem is fixed! I said I don't need a technician. I need a cable that I was advised was free since I paid extra for the HD box! He said I was wrong and was there anything else he could help me with. I said if he calls dispatch to let them know how irate I am and that I would be contacting the head of customer service and any other consumer org so they should get out here ASAP!"
"Mary of Shelbyville , IN",7/27/2009,,"Shelbyville, IN is one of the only cities in the country where Comcast Cable does not offer standard basic cable for around $15.99 per month. When the HD changes took place this year, Comcast offered a $10.99 per month special for that service. One in every four people in Shelbyville is disabled, and a large majority of the population is elderly on a fixed income. Yet, Comcast does not give the option of the standard cable in Shelbyville, IN. The elderly residents are forced to choose between paying over $50 per month or not having cable at all. And most of them can not afford a new TV. Jeff, the manager of the Shelbyville office, has been saying for years that they are going to start making that service available; but it never is. They think they are saving money by doing this, but the fact is a lot of people just do without TV."
"Ila of Orange park, fl",7/27/2009,,"On March 4, 2009, I discontinued my service with Comcast due to moving to South Florida. My account was paid by credit card and upon receiving my bill in April, the account was noted to have a $22.62 credit on my account #**. In April 2009, I returned to my residence in Orange Park, Florida and had my cable and internet access re-established with Comcast. The young man who came to install my services said he was not the regular installer but was here to do the job. His installation number is **, and he made the statement to me that the modem is running slow. I'm not sure this is working properly. If not, you can take care of it at a later date. These services were completed on April 2, 2009. I paid $156.50 to reinstall Comcast internet and cable. On the evening of April 3, 2009, Orange Park experienced a rather bad electrical storm and my internet went out. On the morning of April 4, 2009, I called Comcast to report no lights on the modem and that I did not have internet service. The young woman from Comcast said there was no signal at my house and scheduled a repairman to come out on Monday to see what the problem was. I waited the entire day but no one showed up. I called that day and according to your voice message, the appointment for service was the following week. Now mind you, why would I want to want an additional week for a repairman if I hadn't had service since the day I had the cable re-installed?I spoke with Eric on April 6, 2009 and he couldn't seem to help me. He kept putting me on hold and then he dropped my call into the Orlando cue and I spoke with someone there who didn't know how I got her and she couldn't help me. I called back the local Comcast number and spoke with Ellen who was very apologetic about the entire situation. She informed me Comcast was very busy and they could not come out to my house to diagnose the problem until Thursday April 8, 2009. I informed her of the above situation and asked her why the other Comcast representative didn't tell me this information but just made an appointment for a week later. Now mind you, I have been without internet service for six days from April 3 to April 8. Per Ellen, she said a $20 credit and no internet charges for April 3-April8, 2009 would be on my bill. I spent over 45 minutes of cell phone use just trying to get someone to come out and fix the problem. This is very poor customer service.When the repairman finally came, he said the cable from the box to the house is completely dead. He also replaced the modem. My bill came this month, and yes, there is a credit of $20 and $7.15. There is also a charge for $30 for T/C Trip charge. Prior to my discontinuing Comcast in March 2009, my husband and I were great Comcast customers. Our account was always paid on time actually before the bill was due. I am very disappointed in Comcast. It appears that lightning must have struck your outside cable but you charged me $30 for this to be assessed. I find it kind of strange that prior to the cable being re-installed, I had the $2.95 service plan and had no problems. I reinstalled the cable and the day I reinstalled the cable/internet, there is a problem with lightning and I get dinged for the service charge. This is not right. I want a tracer to find out where my $22.62 credit is and I want the $30 T/C Trip credited to my bill for next month. I have already paid this month's bill. I have tried to call and speak with someone/anyone about this problem. No one seems to know how to handle the problem. I can be reached at ** should you need to speak with me about this problem. I am enclosing a copy of all bills, credit slips and installation receipt. In this bad economy, cable TV and internet services are a luxury, not a necessity. Can you afford to lose me, a good customer? Check my account. It has always been paid on time. Thank you."
"Annmary of Miani, FL",7/27/2009,,"I have been having trouble with my cable. Mainly, itâ€™s with the TV that has a box where you can not see the TV: it is blank. We go days like this and when you make the appointment, they take at least 4 or 5 days to come. If you call on Monday, they come on Thursday. Call on Saturday and they come on Tuesday. One calls and they treat you as if a child is calling with the following questions after telling them yes: â€œDo you see anything now? Are you sure you are looking at the screen? Is the problem happening to all the TVs?â€ One asks for a supervisor and they say no one is around or on duty no matter what time or day one calls. They proceed to give you another rep who knows less and starts to ask the same questions and treat you as a child. Please, if we pay late, they cut you for one month of service. They claim to give you a credit, but the bill is always higher and you still have to wait the days. I have 6 kids here and run a daycare and they only know they cannot see TV."
"Alex of Berkeley, CA",7/28/2009,,"I have always had a problem understanding Comcast invoices, and I have always suspected that their invoices are fraudulent, never matching up to what their reps promise verbally. Moreover, if just one of your payments is late for whatever reason, the bills/invoices to come continue to become even more impossible to understand. Their invoices are designed to obfuscate, confuse, and deny access to what they are really doing; bilking the customer out of monies beyond those fees that are agreed to be paid for services rendered.They have no customer service to help sort out their invoicing tactics either. They have an actual store nearby which I went to, but was waiting in line for over 45 minutes, before my back couldn't take standing up any longer. I went home and called their customer service number instead, only to find that it was simply a recording with no links to anyone. Their website had a link with a question, do you wish to open online session with a customer service rep? Clicked on the link and an hour later, I was still waiting to contact someone at Comcast. Isn't there a federal law that requires handicap access, which Comcast has violated here? Feds, where are you?Most critical of all is that it is fairly clear that Comcast is engaging in some kind of illegal billing. This company should be investigated by the authorities, and shut down, to let a more honest broker of communication services replace it. What is really needed now though is for someone from the District Attorney's Office discreetly subscribe to Comcast services and discover the rotten eggs in their billing practices. Comcast is a company that behaves less like a communication company and more like a Jersey mob shop."
"Stacey of Friendswood, TX",7/29/2009,,"I have been a Comcast customer for 8 years. I have used their service (expanded basic cable) in 2 different apartment complexes in the greater Houston area. I scheduled Comcast to install cable and Internet service to my new apartment on 7/24. I gave the representative my new phone number. I was told that a technician would be out between 5-8 p.m.I called Comcast at 6 p.m. to confirm that the technician was coming. I was told that Comcast had tried to call me, but got no answer. I thought that was weird considering that I had my phone right beside me all day. I asked what number they called. The representative told me the number from my previous apartment. I told her that they had the wrong number. She corrected the phone number and said that someone would be calling me shortly. No one ever called or showed up on Monday.I called at 9:30 on Tuesday morning. I was told that my problem had been noted and was labeled ""accelerated"" and since it was early in the morning and slow, someone would be calling me within an hour to send the technician out. No one called. I called back at 1 p.m., and was again told that they were sorry, I would receive a call within an hour. No one called.I called back at 3 p.m. I was told that they were sorry for my inconvenience and was given a $20 credit to my account, and again was told that I would receive a call within an hour. No one called or showed up. I called back at 4:30 p.m., and was told that they could reschedule my installation for a week from that Tuesday or they could resubmit the acceleration, but it could take up to 72 hours (first time I had heard that). I opted to resubmit the acceleration.I called Comcast on Wednesday at 1 p.m. and went through the same story with yet another CSR. I am still waiting and still have not heard anything from a Comcast technician."
"Michael of Lookout Mountain, GA",7/30/2009,,"Comcast has made changes to their cable service which requires me to purchase additional hardware on a monthly basis just to view the television channels that I am already paying monthly to receive. This change is an underhanded way of raising their fees, plus, it requires me to have more hardware, more remote controls, and more power consumption all at a time when my income has been cut in half by our terrible economy."
"Cortney of Madison Heights, MI",7/30/2009,,"After 3 years of being a loyal Comcast customer, I called to cancel my cable TV but keep my internet. The girl informed me that there would be a $25 disconnection fee plus I have to hand deliver their cable boxes and modems. The woman on the phone didn't seem to care about my business or doing anything to make the situation right. Even when I told her I would be taking my business to WOW. I said I'm trying to cut back my expenses and all Comcast is doing is overcharging for everything. I don't feel I should have to pay this fee. But out of fear of damaging my credit, I will reluctantly pay it. "
"Vincent of Powder Springs, GA",7/30/2009,,"I am writing this after Comcast put me through 48 hours of hell but it really started over a year ago. I am an avid football fan so I decided after over 15 years of basic cable with Comcast to get a DVR. I researched the DVR and found that it was limited in recording size by 160 gig HD. There was no option to upgrade it internally or externally. Comcast had also made sure the customer could not offload any recordings to a computer or get a different DVR. Everything was no, no, no. I decided to live with it expecting Comcast to eventually allow customers to upgrade.About two weeks ago, with football season approaching, I decided to revisit the DVR situation. I was surprised that it was identical to last year. Comcast has disabled or blocked every possible way to get more recording space. My DVR can record only 20 hours of HD. One HD football game lasts for 4 hours. I could almost fill this DVR up in one weekend of football. This was when a coworker mentioned I should get TiVo. The more research I did, the more I found the answers where yes, yes, yes.The TiVo was highly upgradeable in every way. There was one problem. There is a multitude of horror stories on websites such as comcastmustdie.com and others of Comcast customers who have attempted and failed to get Comcast to do one simple thing (install Comcast cable card in the TiVo box). After researching the situation and considering that I hold a Masters Degree in Information Systems from Kennesaw State University, I figured I could walk a Comcast CSR through the process.I knew from my research that I would be better off to go to Comcast and get the m-card because every part of this process could be done over the phone. It's a simple matter of typing some numbers in a computer (m-card pairing) and sending an initialization hit from the Vinings head end. I also knew that many of the service reps sent out have no idea what they are doing. I won't even go into the trouble I went through to actually get the m-card from Comcast.When my TiVo arrived, I followed the instructions and made sure that the latest software was installed. On Monday night, July 27th, I was ready to make my first of about ten calls to Comcast customer service. The CSR was named Pat. I knew from the online forums what numbers she needed such as host ID and data ID. She said she didn't need all those numbers - that everything would start working in about 45 minutes. Nothing happened so I went to bed and started the next morning.I didn't get the names of every CSR I talked to but I know it was at least 8, and maybe 10. The fact that the first one I talked to didn't set up a case file proves that their entire existence is a joke to Comcast. With a case file, the eighth CSR I talk to will know this. Asking them a question is equal to asking the guy that bags my groceries what to do about my cable TV. Sometime on Tuesday afternoon, one of the CSRs mentioned that she could schedule a field rep to install my cable card the next day. I was exhausted so I reluctantly agreed knowing I may be paying $17 for more misery.Lamont arrived at 12 noon today in a Comcast truck. I started bombarding him with technical information about Val:V missing and the Auth:MP problem. He didn't know what I was talking about but he assured me he would get my cable card working. I took some notes. He called someone at ** using my phone because his was malfunctioning. He told them he was getting an illogical equipment message from the first person (the dispatcher) he called that could not help him. He said it was job number **. He switched the m-card I had received from Comcast with another one. He also solved one mystery.From the second I received the m-card, I was billed for digital service a/o. He said the Comcast rep had charged me for an additional stb instead. These charges were on the bill that I received on Tuesday. I was able to check the conditional access screen (which he knew nothing about) and see that the Val:? had changed to Val:V but Auth:MP still displayed which needs to be Auth:S. He said I was 36th in line to receive an init hit from the Vinings head end. He said I should have all my channels within an hour and he would call back to verify.He assured me that if the init hit failed, he would return to fix it. Indeed, some unencrypted HD channels displayed as he was leaving. I commended him and told him I would keep checking channels until he called. He gave me a receipt and took my Comcast DVR and the original m-card I had received from Comcast. That was about 5 hours ago and no call. Below, I have provided every piece of information Comcast may need to correct these problems. I believe it would take a person with basic knowledge of how to use a computer and telephone about 5 to 10 minutes to fix this problem.The grief this has caused me has made a permanent negative impression on me concerning Comcast. What is the price to pay for that? Right now, my options are limited. I have invested in a TiVo DVR, a year of TiVo service, and football season is coming up. My personal knowledge of technology ensures me that a time will come in the near future that I can rid myself of this Comcast. Consider this: I intended to eventually have Comcast cable, Comcast Internet service and Comcast phone service. Now, I intend to eventually rid my house of all traces of Comcast.In the meantime, this is what must happen in the next 24 hours. I want every single channel that I am paying for restored and an email or phone call from Comcast assuring me that I have been refunded for the erroneous charges and that I am not charged one single minute for the DVR and m-card Lamont took with him. I also will not be charged for Lamont accomplishing nothing. Make sure the $17 is removed. Considering what I have been through, I should receive a month's credit but I can assure you at this point with the time and money this has cost me that would be an insult. You will however give me what's mine. I will not waste my time on the phone with another Comcast CSR and I would prefer that no one else from Comcast be sent to my house.In the event that all of this does not take place at 5:00 pm eastern on Thursday, July 30th, 2009, I will draft a cover letter and place that and this entire email in letters to the president and CEO of Comcast and every member of the board of directors of Comcast, the FCC, the governor's office of Consumer Affairs and the BBB. I also intend to post this email on comcastmustdie.com and any other websites or forum that will allow me. Next week, I plan to start requesting meetings with the President, CEO and members of Comcast board of directors. These people need to hear in person what Comcast is doing to its customers."
"Pj of Tacoma, WA",7/31/2009,,"I'm still on hold while writing this, at 58 minutes so far. The canned message keeps saying that my call is important to them so to keep holding since calls are answered in the order received. There's no excuse for a hold of going on an hour. That shows me that my call is anything but important to them! As far as I'm concerned, Comcast owes me $50 because that's what I earn an hour."
"David of LaMarque, TX",7/31/2009,,"Why does the service shut off and then eventually come back on? This has been going on for weeks. I haven't watched a complete TV program. I have noticed it more frequently since the digital change over. Whatâ€™s going on? Whenever/if I call the techs, they want to send somebody out and then want to charge me for it. Then, if that's not enough, if you go through the same process again, next week you get tagged again for the charges. Why? When can I get a break and get something for my having to put up with this kind of service? Damn, I nearly have to rent any movies if I want to see the complete show. You miss bits and pieces of a program and you can understand whatâ€™s going on. When are you going to resolve the problems?"
"Preston of mt Juliet, TN",3/1/2010,,"I was paying $143.00 a month for Comcastâ€™s triple play: cable TV, internet, and phone service.  I was told I was locked into this for two years starting 08-09.  They recently raised my bill, changing my service.  They told me that because I did not sign a contract and the 'package' I had was no longer offered, I could not keep it.  I talked to a supervisor and was told my new monthly bill will be restored.  They have now sent me a bill for $173.00 which included $21.00 for a partial month of my new service.  They have lied to me on two occasions about what I am getting and what it costs.  I was never told about a contract, nor was I ever sent one.  I cannot afford to keep paying more and more to Comcast when they tell me my bill will be the same for two years and then change it saying I never signed a contract."
"Angela of Douglasville, GA",3/1/2010,,"On or about, Thursday, January 14, 2010, we had the Triple Play Package installed at our residential property. From day one, we have been calling with complaints regarding the billing/listing that should have been under our business name, New Vision Housing, but for a residential property. It took Comcast three weeks to finally resolve and fix that issue. Meanwhile the services are constantly not working.To this day the internet has only worked two days and that has occurred over this past week (with the need of technicians coming out twice this week and hours on the phone with Customer Service over a four-day period). Only to find out that the original technician placed the wrong power pack on the modem, which caused the modem not to work properly and eventually the modem blew out on Sunday, February 21st, causing the telephone connected to the modem to blow its power pack out, as well as four electrical outlets, a GFCI in our kitchen area. Because the electrical is not working, the burners do not work on the stove top.We have had no properly working service since day 2 of the installation and the tech placed the wrong power pack on the modem causing it to blow, along with our kitchen electrical--and the Billing Department has offered to eliminate only $75 from a $300 bill because Customer Service has not always notated the Comcast computer narrative when I call in. A technician was scheduled to come out on February 9, 2010 and was a complete no -how. So frustrated with the entire system and their poor customer service, I did not have time to call in again until Saturday, February 20, 2010--when I spoke to seven different reps--two that would not identify their IDs because of the ongoing complaints that I had.One that did not identify himself to me is so ignorant that he didn't realize that he scheduled an appointment for a tech to come out on February 22nd and upon my complaint--Management can identify him. He also refused to transfer me to his Supervisor. He hung up on me. At this point, I am waiting for a Billing Supervisor to review our file in order to make the appropriate adjustments to the bill. Our goal is to have all the charges eliminated and obtain another service provider--because we continue to have problem with the service working properly.Definitely we should not be expected to pay for installation when the tech placed the wrong power pack on the modem and is now causing us to be without usage of our stove top. I am drafting a letter to the CEO in hopes that he will eliminate this outstanding bill before a scheduled dissconnection of services. Because Comcast Staff will review the file and the reps have not continually notated the records when we call in with each issue."
"Carol of Lansing, MI",3/2/2010,,"Comcast had a promotion whereas if you signed up for cable services, you would get $150.00 in gas.  I signed up and then was sent a voucher to submit either by mail or online to GotGasPromo.com.  I was to enter the promo code given and choose a gas station vendor to purchase gas from and I had to save up $100.00 a month in gas receipts and send them in.  I was then supposed to receive $25.00 a month for 6 months as long as I sent in my receipts by the end of the last day of the month.  Well, I never received the monthly coupons that were supposed to be turned in with the receipts.  I called the number listed in the letter I received and once again requested the coupons, I have yet to receive them.  This is very suspicious and misleading by Comcast and GotGasPromo.  I have yet to receive any ""free"" gas. "
"Heidi of Hampstead, NH",3/3/2010,,"Have had no service for phones, internet or TV for over a week. Called and spoke with someone every day and they are ""working"" on it. I am alone with three kids, one with medical problems and I have no way of calling for help."
"Anthony of Somerset, NJ",3/3/2010,,"I signed up under a promotion they were running for the new year. Free DVR for six months then $8.99 for the last six months, 2 free HD boxes, no service charge and $150 gift card. I told the operator when I signed up. She said that it was a great package and a lot of people are coming on board due to it. Well, it's all a lie. I have went back and forth with numerous CSA and multiple trips to corporate office, regarding my bill. The set price is supposed to be $138.92. I got as far as talking to a manager Frank and emailing him the offer. But nothing ever comes out of it. They just keep giving me runaround.I've given up on the $150 gift card, just to get the billing right but that's an impossible feat. It took me four trips to the Randolph rd office because the girl they have there kept telling me I'd have to pay for them when phone CS just told me different. This also happened with my internet service through them as well. That was only three trips though. Time and time again, I asked for a manager or supervisor. They always say they're out. They charged me for a DVR $30/mo. I never had another box for $8.99/mo, phone service $30/mo for months. That's alot of money.If I didn't have family issues with my one-year old, I'd been on top of it. It's just when the hospital bill come in, I start looking where all the money went to and why. I was able to get just some of the credit from all the overcharges. And now, I've come to the end of my one year service contract with them and I'm still fighting for some answers. I just filled a formal complaint after waiting 20 minutes on hold just to be hung up on because I couldn't produce my account number. But I could give her all the other information she wanted. I waited on hold for 35 minutes for a supervisor tonight trying to resolve this only to find out she's not a real supervisor. They are doing and charging what they want and not honoring their promotions. And when you try to find out why, they stone wall you. I have had many kind conversations with multiple CSRs but none that could aid in this struggle of lies and deceit. "
"Maria of Edinburg, PA",3/5/2010,,"I was denied cable service at my home. There is one person on my road who gets it, and two of us were denied.  We only live within eight tenths of a mile from each other."
"Gracie of Hamtramck, MI",3/6/2010,,"I have been trying unsuccessfully to get Comcast service where I live. I have been told that there was a block put on this address and that is why I cannot receive cable service. My son is the one who has an outstanding bill with Comcast (he even has Comcast cable at this new address and if it is not in his name, then it is being done illegally by using another person's name). I have talked to several customer associates at Comcast to resolve this matter and get this block removed from my address so that I can get Comcast for myself under my name (I did have Comcast myself in the past and did pay my bills). Please, can someone help me? I just want to receive Comcast service and I do not feel that it is right to penalize me for the actions of anyone else even if that person happens to be my son! It is just not right. I do pay my bills so why should I be penalized?I have done all that I can do. I have given your people at Comcast Henry's current address so that you can pursue collection of the debt that he owes you. I have even given you information that you can use to check and see for yourself that he is getting Comcast cable at his current address where only he and his wife live, so he must be getting it under another person's name illegally. Thank you very much."
"Emily of Clinton, MD",3/6/2010,,"As a Comcast customer for over 13 years, we received notice for ""Enhancing our network by ordering digital equipment"" more upgrades in the mail and captions running on the bottom of the TV screen that required action by March 16, 2010.On March 5, 2010 at 9:50am, I called Comcast as directed and spoke with customer service rep. Joe (no last name), who was unable to access my account from my home number or the information I received from Comcast in the mailer. Joe was very short with his answers and ready to disconnect the call before I could ask any questions about the digital device. Joe stated that I had to order the devices and schedule an install or I would only get channels 2 through 23 for $7.95.I was totally dissatisfied with this information not to mention very rude service, so I ask Joe for his supervisor or manager and he stated that ""they are busy and you will have to email, mail your complaint or hold for next available"". I ask for a contact number and he said, 820445 and disconnect the call, no surprise there.I called back and spoke with Mary, who was very informative and professional. She explained the entire enhancement offer. Now, it turns out that we do not need the digital device after all and we can keep our current service."
"Sharon of Detroit, MI",3/8/2010,,"I called to see why I could not get on 90% of the websites I wanted to get on. They insisted that it was not Comcast's fault. So for about month, I could only get about 3 or 4 websites. Every time I got on the internet, Comcast site would pop up and would not allow me to get on the website I wanted to get on. I asked my son if he could fix it. He called Comcast and they told him it was a problem on their end. So after being charged for an internet service I could not use for over a month, I feel my account should get a credit."
"Michael of Oakley, CA",3/8/2010,,"The channels they advertise are not what you get.  Furthermore, they never sent us any warning that they were going to eliminate channels from my package, so when I called them to find out on Friday night, the operator explained that he would reboot my cable box and all should be fine within minutes.  However, it did not work.  I called back on Saturday morning, but the operator I spoke with explained that they conducted an audit on the week of 3/1/2010 and decided to take away certain channels from my package. Comcast did not warn me of this and their webpage link reflects that they actually offer more channels for my packages than what I have actually been receiving these years.  On Saturday, they were going to look into this and respond by 11AM that morning, but I never heard back.  I called them again this morning and they responded by saying that if I wanted the eliminated channels, I would have to upgrade my packages.  I alerted them to the advertised channel packages listed online and explained that I never got all that's on this webpage list.  The operator said that the Web site is wrong and that if I want to upgrade, it would cost an additional $29.95 per month.Does this sound like ""bait and switch"" or ""false advertisement?""  Please help me and the possible millions of others that are taken advantage of by Comcast and their policies.  I wonder if they are changing their website as we speak.  I printed what they say to print for the channel line-up packages."
"Cindi of Frostproof, FL",3/11/2010,,"Our service was turned off with no prior notification. We have only had this service for 2 plus months and have paid a total of $220 for a service that is only supposed to be $49.99 a month. They bill one month ahead and still had the audacity to discontinue our service. I have phoned them several times with no satisfaction whatsoever.When Comcast installed our cable, they drilled a hole through our new wooden floor without our permission, and then they filled it with a big ugly glob of caulking. Also, the installer broke a $200 Armini statue that cannot be replaced."
"Christine of Santa Clara, CA",3/11/2010,,"I am absolutely furious with Comcast. They will not tell you this but they are ripping all of us off! I found out today from a technician of Comcast who called me to cancel the appointment I had scheduled because I have been having that resetting problem with both of my DCX3400 boxes. It happens to me about 10-12 times a day and the guide never comes back up. All it says is to be announced! The tech told me that it is a hardware and firmware problem that Comcast is having and they have had this problem for months! Can you believe it, months?! Yet, you still have to pay your bill even though the service is not there, and no one, if you call or talk to Comcast representatives online ever knows whats going on. The tech said they do know about this problem and are supposed to tell us and credit our accounts for all the months of service we have not had but they are playing dumb and scheduling appointments anyway. They didn't even tell the technicians what the appointment I had scheduled was for? When the guy called me, he had to ask what the problem was and when I told him he immediately stopped me and told me that he was canceling the appointment because this problem can not be fixed. They are trying to fix it but it is a firmware & hardware issue so there is nothing they can do. Comcast needs to notify their customers and refund our money for the lack of service! Oh, and by the way, if you had called to complain about this several times and the reps did not note your account, then say you call again and complain, they will only credit you from the day that one of the reps who actually did their job and noted the account. For instance, I called several times over the past few months and no one notated the account until I spoke to a guy on the web on March 4th. So, they are saying they will only credit from March 4th to today March 10th, even though they know it has been going on for months and they can't fix it so it's going to continue to happen! I asked for a Supervisor and still they will do nothing! Who knows how long this will continue but does that mean I have to call every single month to make the reps note and credit the account for the lack of service? I guess so if you want your bill credited! The supervisor even admitted it. The last time I contacted Comcast was 10/23/09 for this problem (and was told then that I cannot get a credit until the issue is resolved; I had to call back again once it was resolved to get the credit) but since I didn't call every month to tell them it still wasn't working, they will not credit me. She even told me again when she scheduled the appointment that she cannot give credit even now because the issue has not been resolved. It's the same thing I was told before, you just can't win! But she will give me a credit for the missed appointment today of $20. I pay $237 a month for service that I don't get! This makes no sense! "
"Orlando of Philadelphia, PA",3/11/2010,,"Comcast have been charging me for the past 4 years for a piece of equipment that I do not have, a modem and a cable box, that I never had. I had made several phone calls complaining about this situation and I was told that a technical service representative will come, but he never showed up, so I decided to cancel the services and return the two HD cable box that I had. Now they are charging me $543.54 for unknown reason and threatening to destroy my credit if I do not pay this bill in 30 days."
"Unni of Ashland, VA",3/12/2010,,"I am a small business owner started an office in Ashland VA in Feb 2010. I opted to go with Comcast Internet and phone line. Comcast has published my line to the world and it interrupts my work terribly. Poor phone quality and annoying incoming is giving more headache than I wanted. So I called up Comcast to request to discontinue phone line with Comcast. Ms. Susan from Comcast said, I had signed a three year contract with Comcast and I just completed one month trial period and a cancellation would result in fee over thousand dollars. Apparently, the exit clause is paying off 70 percent of the future fees to Comcast.Is this one sided contract valid? It is causing significant productivity loss with unwanted phone calls. "

"Jennifer of Blue Springs, MO",3/12/2010,,"I recently moved to an area with Comcast cable turned on. Everything went right as planned till after a month after I moved in. I got a bill that said I owed about 450.00 dollars from 8 years ago. I have never had Comcast and have lived at my last address for 11 years. When I called, they said that there was nothing I could do that it was my bill when they finally told me about the bill it was not even in my name!Just SS number so they told me that if I took in proof of where I lived and my state ID they would get it off my account. Now let me tell you this was 3 months ago and now my cable is off and I'm still being charged a monthly bill! So I called everyday and get the same answer that they will have to have someone else call me back and let me tell you I call 3 times a week and still have not heard anything! So what am I supposed to do? I have lost cable TV and still being charged for it and it's on my credit, even though I have gave them everything they asked and showed them that this account was not even in my name. How can they charge me for it?"
"Lisa of North wildwood, NJ",3/12/2010,,"I have been calling and requesting a copy of the change work order performed in June 2009 since 08/2009. I have been told by 6 different times I would receive a call back with resolution and to date have not. Comcast upgraded and changed my cable without my request or consent. They have ignore my several attempts to rectify the situation. My last message from Naomi (ID#9KI) stated that now too much time has passed for the company to credit my account. It was Comcast and solely Comcast that let time come in the way. Overcharged consumer. Taken advantage of the the customer, very unprofessional business practices."
"Maureen of Gaithersburg, MD",3/12/2010,,"I was told by another customer service agent that my bill should be no more than $102 including tax. Marlene has told me it should be $104 including tax which comes out to $110 and that my bills has never gone up. I asked her if she would bring up the last six months of bills and show me the charges. She refused to do this saying I should have copies which I have thrown away. She said she only has to show me 3 months. She was extremely stubborn and would not let me talk to a manager. When I got angry, she finally said she would have someone call me back within 4 hours. I would like to transfer to a new company but Comcast has a large fee that I would have to pay if I cancel before 2 years are up. I can't trust them at all and should not have to stay with the company or pay their fee if I cancel. I have superb credit and I should not have to put up with all of this."

"Robert of Denver, CO",3/14/2010,,"I recently decided to change to Comcast internet after a bad experience with Qwest. I already have Comcast cable and besides being overpriced, I have little bad to say. However, when I called to place an order for a new internet account with Comcast, the rep offered promises but did not deliver in any way, shape or form. I placed the order on 03/01 and advised the rep my Qwest service would be canceled as of 03/12. He assured me all items needed such as cables and the modem would be delivered by then. With well over a week to do so, how could this have gone wrong? Of course, I never received anything. When I called back, they admitted it was their fault and that the order did not even go out. They could not have anyone bring it to me even though there are several offices in my area. I could either wait another 2 days for delivery or I could got to them to get the equipment and install myself. Well, I personally do not think I should have to waste my time for a mistake they admitted was theirs. When I advised to cancel the order, there was no further attempt to remedy the situation. They were quite content to not have my business. I will also be canceling my cable television asap. My advice to anyone who reads this: If you have any other alternative to Comcast or Qwest in you area, go with it. Avoid these companies like the plague. They are the typical large corporations that couldn't really care less."
"John of Mohrsville, PA",3/14/2010,,"Comcast reported in their TV advertisements, in 2008-2009, that cable subscribers would not need a digital TV converter ,as they would continue to broadcast in analog. Now that government vouchers are no longer available, they are converting all to digital and require us to rent converters from them. They allow 2 free, and charge for any additional. I have 6 TVs, and now must rent from them. A classic case of bait and switch."
"Don of Wilmington, DE",3/15/2010,,"I am, at this point, so frustrated and angry at Comcast that I don't know where to start. I've been a Comcast customer for many years (about 10). I think and while I've been bombarded with Verizon FiOs ads and reps coming to my house, I've remained with Comcast. But in recent years, it has been my observation that Comcast is its own worst enemy. And my experiences of the last month may have been the straw that will cause me to switch to Verizon as have virtually all of my neighbors.For the past year, ending 2/27/10, I've been on a triple play promotion, paying $140 every month. Knowing that my next bill would jump to the full price, I called Comcast in early March to see if there were any new promotions I could get on because I had no intention of paying more than what I had been paying for the past year. After a discussion with a rep from the ""Customer Retention"" section, I was told that I would now be on a plan costing $122 and change plus taxes and fees, which would put my next bill at something around $130 which was fine.Within two days of that discussion, I received a letter from Comcast (not a flyer, a letter addressed directly to me) with the header: ""An exclusive thank you for being one of our most valued customers. Including a new monthly discount."" The discounts described in the letter were a $10 Triple Play Rewards Credit and a $25 Valued Customer Credit, for a total monthly credit of $35 for the next 12 months as long as I maintained my current level of service. Subtracting the credits from the regular $157 price results in the same $122 that the Customer Retention rep gave me, which I had thought was a ""deal"" but turns out he was only giving me the same total discount that Comcast was telling me about via the letter. But no problem.Then about 10 days ago we were having trouble with our TV service (tiling, sound drop-outs) and called for a technician to investigate. He arrived late and informed me that as a result, I would get a $20 credit on my next statement. So I expected to see a total bill of around $110, including taxes and fees, for my first off-promotion bill. I have been on auto-pay for years, and happened to check my checking account online this morning. To my shock, I saw that Comcast had taken $136.93 from my account for this month, which means that without the $20 late technician credit it would have been about $157. I immediately called and talked to ""Ruth"" in Customer Retention.I told her about my discussion with another rep a few weeks ago saying that my next bill would be for $122 (excluding taxes and fees) and the letter I had gotten from Comcast giving me $35 in credits for the next year, which would also have taken the bill down to the same $122. The first two things she said after looking up my account was that (a) I had not been put on any $122 plan, and (b) (this was the real shocker!) the $35-credit letter had been sent to me in error! At that point, I lost it, telling her in no uncertain terms that Comcast was a liar and that I wanted the company to credit me the $35 I had been promised. However, given this most recent experience, I don't believe anything a Comcast rep tells me, so I have removed auto-pay from my account settings so that I can control what I pay. Whether or not the $35 credit I was promised by the rep I talked to weeks ago and in the letter from Comcast, I will pay only the $122 plus fees and taxes. And if I don't get the credit for having overpaid for March, I will deduct that, too. If Comcast has a problem with what I pay, I'm off to Verizon! If you're thinking about getting Comcast, better think again."
"Keith of Poughquag, NY",3/15/2010,,"Service and confusion reign supreme at Comcast.  After hours on the phone in December and January and I was told I needed to upgrade, my underground services stopped when the services went digital in early March.  After a commitment in January, a person at Comcast told me since my construction commitment was older than 30 days, someone had to come to the house again for the 4th time to decide if there is a problem.  It appears to me the problem is Comcast and this is not the first time and state I have had a similar issue.  The cost to run this company has got to be ridiculous and passed on to the consumer.  Fios is not available and Frontier is not in the game.  No choice would be better than the frustration of dealing with Comcast."
"Nathan of Hopelawn, NJ",3/16/2010,,"Comcast insisted on sending a tech to verify a strong signal at the cable end inside the house. She said it was at no charge, she claimed it was for free. After the visit I was charged and supervisor of customer service said that I had to pay. As of today, I keep getting phone calls about paying the fee and account is now delinquent. Every single customer rep has an attitude and do not want to help anyone. They talk over you and do not show any concern for your situation."
"Debbie of Stephenson, VA",3/16/2010,,"Comcast switched my service from HD Plus bundle to Economy without my permission. When I called them to ask them to fix it (03/06) and spoke to Vicki, she said she would have to send my problem to escalation because she didn't know why that had happened and that someone would call me back later that same day. When no one called by 03/15, I sent an email to Comcast and was told by Jason that ""I understand that you would like to speak to a Customer Care Specialist via telephone; however, Online Customer Care Specialists communicate solely through electronic communications.""So I called again today 03/16 and spoke to Nicole. I was on the phone with her for over an hour, and she said the only thing she could do to make sure I was billed at the $119 rate I signed up for was to switch me to a similar promotion, but it would end in March 2011 instead of July 2011. She said they have no way of switching me back to my original plan as it is gone from their system. "
"Richard of Elkins park, pa",3/16/2010,,"Comcast doubled my bill. Upon complaint, I was offered Triple Play to which I agreed. For the installation appointment, 3.5 hours wasted. I called 10 minutes after they missed the 2-hour guaranteed window. I called back, he said he was at my door, untrue! The next caller admitted that they could not reach the installer who showed up hour later with wrong service order! I had him survey house anyway, only to be told that installation could not take place as ordered and verified on phone, and that I had to provide a shelf for the ""black box"". Comcast, if you care, rdr91-americaline. Other wise, take a hike! It's 4 hours away from work. I was told lots of lies. There's higher cost of service to maintain the status quo with no installation."
"Brian of Washington, DC",3/16/2010,,"Comcast has recently been announcing that some of their channels would be changing to all digital formats. These channels would be unavailable if you do not have a digital converter. A decision was made to upgrade to digital preferred service. The appointment was made. Automated confirmation was received on the day before the appointment and on the day of the appointment.No one showed up within the time allotted although, someone called when time period ended and stated that the technician was running late. Five (5) hours later, there was no tech, no call and no notification of any kind. We found out later that night that Comcast had changed the appointment to three days later. When contacted, they stated that they would were trying to find out what happened to the tech and would send one right out. Yeah right. Eleven (9) hours later, still no tech. We have experienced some of the worst service imaginable in the DC area from Comcast yet, they monopolize the region. Do not choose Comcast if you can avoid it. "
"Susan of Midlothian, VA",3/17/2010,,"I originally came to this site to complain about MSN and/or My MSN changes but then found the Comcast complaints. I have never had a problem like any of the described issues in this thread. As a matter of fact, one tech that visited our home suggested that we sign up for a ""special"" they were running -- one year and only $.99 per visit. After this expired, I was able to negotiate another year for $1.99 each visit. Since we live in an older home, this has been well worth this small fee.I don't know if anyone has ever used ""Customer Retention"", but I use it every time our contract comes up for renewal. And did you know that if you see an advertisement for something even better, call them, ask nicely, and you might just get the new ""special"" and even extend it for one year. We have the triple play package right now and yes, the phone service isn't as good as Verizon. The tech admitted that to me but I have to say, it's getting better and better. We still kept our Verizon cell phones as it's the best coverage in our area.When we were having trouble installing the Apple Time Capsule (with a PC), I called the Comcast computer support number and asked if he could offer any suggestions. He went above and beyond and walked me through the whole process (even said ""now you're writing all this down, right -- several times).Yeah, we pay more than we think we should, but our only other choice in our area is Verizon Fios. In the community where we live, satellite dishes are prohibited so that's not an option. I can live with the small problems we have with the HD boxes since it usually just involves a re-set. Their new billing method is easy to read and understand. I've found that when I do have to call them, the nicer I am, the more cooperation I receive. I don't ever call any company with a complaint when I initially receive the bill. Giving myself time to review the issue(s) and have my facts straight means they usually treat me with the respect I deserve as a consumer. If they don't, then I nicely ask if this call could be recorded starting immediately. But that's just me. To begin, the way you go about making your complaint sets the tone for the ultimate outcome. Documentation is an absolute necessity."
"Steve of San Jose, CA",3/17/2010,,"We subscribe to Comcast Internet. Recently they have sent emails to our account to download their Norton Virus software and to uninstall the current McAfee software. I followed the 4 step procedure to discover that Windows 2000 is not supported. As a result, I no longer have any anti virus s/w running on our PC since one of the 4 steps was to uninstall McAfee. After many phone calls, I was advised that my PC was ""too old"" and I needed to purchase an upgrade. If this was the case, I would never have uninstalled McAfee in an attempt to install Norton. Comcast has recommended Norton, but now claims it is up to me to purchase additional products. I can no longer use our PC for internet access. I no longer have any virus protection software on our PC and can no longer connect to the internet unless I purchase a Windows upgrade at my expense."
"Antoinette of Quincy, MA",3/17/2010,,"For months, we were bombarded with TV ads and countdown clocks that said TV was going from analog to digital. If we had TVs that were cable-ready hooked up with a coax cable, we did not need to do anything. Everything was fine. I didn't need to do a thing. Now, I have received a letter from Comcast that I will need to get DTAs (digital transport adapters) for all my sets. I will get one digital cable box and two digital adapters free of charge, since I will need one additional adapter. It will be $1.99 per month. I must do this by April 13 or I will lose stations 24-69, since they are now going digital. What? I thought that is what already happened!On March 16, I picked up the required equipment. We hooked everything up and called for activation as required. Bam...I lost all HD channels. We called Comcast and were informed that we will need to get HD boxes. The first one is $7 per month, and each additional is $13.99 per month. I pay $68.48 per month for extended Basic cable. The additional cost would bring my monthly bill up to $117.45. How is this even legal?We were told by Comcast that we do not pay for the channels. We pay for the equipment. Really? If I don't rent their equipment, I will lose channels. Just seems like another cable ripoff to me. I buy HD TVs and cannot enjoy them, unless I pay Comcast for the privilege. What do you think, and can anything be done to stop this? When stations first went digital, the government gave out coupons to the people who could not afford new TVs to help defray costs. Now Comcast has found a way to undermine that. I am on a disability, awaiting a lung transplant. I certainly cannot afford my cable bill to almost double, just so I can actually enjoy the HD TVs I paid for. Something has to be done to stop this. "
"Allen of Cupertino, CA",3/18/2010,,"I have had Comcast service for years and recently in their home page area, I have stock portfolios that take about 1-2 hours to enter in their financial section. Recently, the portfolios have disappeared and required re-entering by me. At the same time, elsewhere on the home page, there is a place for weather at a specific zip code. I enter 95014 for Cupertino and after a few days, it switches of its own accord to Philadelphia. I am tired of re-entering my data. I spent 45 minutes on the phone with people in Mexico who sent me to the wrong people and initially told me that whenever Comcast worked on the system, I would lose my data and later a supervisor told me that the problem was not with Comcast but with my computer. It takes me 1 - 2 hours to re-enter the stock data and if Comcast can't improve their service and accept responsibility, I will go to AT&T."
"William of St Helena Is, SC",3/23/2010,,Trying to use the Comcast high speed internet self install program has been one of the frustrating things I have done in many years. I have gotten into the system but cannot use the email either to send or receive any message except ones I do not want. Their is no anti spam program in this boondogle that I am able to find. I was told by the local agent that I would be able to bring my email address book from outlook express to this account and I now find that is impossible to do. A customer service rep from Orlando attempted to help me but she gave up also and said it was a problem with Outlook express. I seriously doubt that since outlook express worked very well until I made the mistake of transferring to Comcast high speed internet service. This problem must have an answer and I would appreciate knowing what it is. 
"Michael of Maynard, MA",3/23/2010,,I ordered the Comcast triple play for $99 a month. I have had the service for 8 months for a total of $792. I have paid them a total of $1082 and still owe $584. That is more than double the advertised price of $99 a month. The service was shut off without cause.
"Michael of Portsmouth, NH",3/24/2010,,My wife Marie ** called Comcast a week and a half ago to get cable and internet access for our house. The internet seems to be not working and the person that came here that day from Comcast was not very helpful and did not offer to connect the internet or cable for me. I would greatly appreciate it if someone from Comcast could come by our house to see what the problem is as I need the internet for my work. I would very thankful if someone could contact me about this matter. Thank you.
"Barb of Mechanicsville, VA",3/25/2010,,"I am sending a complaint because I feel that I have been treated very badly by Comcast.  I was advised by a supervisor, Devon **, that I would receive a call from him on 3/24/10, between 7:00 and 7:30pm.  He never called.  This was after repeated requests to speak to a supervisor on several occasions over the poor customer service in both the billing and tech support departments.I am a new Comcast Cable customer, and was installed on 3/10/10.  Until today, I had very poor, if any reception or connection, and also my phone service, which I switched from Verizon to Comcast also was experiencing problems.  One of the tech support technicians said that I may receive a free premium channels if I would ask.  He also said, ""Be careful not to trip again over the exposed cable line that he installed outside.""  Then the billing department doubled my bill.  I was also told to continue paying my bill regardless, and it was doubtful I would receive any promotional free premium channels as a consolation.  Thank you for your attention to this matter."
"Dennis of Alpharetta, GA",3/28/2010,,"I cancelled my service with Comcast, then returned my digital boxes. They came to my home and called several times asking for the boxes, although they have verified that they received the boxes. They then sent me bills. I called 7 times and each time they verified they owed me $7.26 and that they agreed that the service was cancelled and the boxes returned. They then sent a collection agency a notice stating that I owed them $45.80.They concur this was their error and corrected by refusing to send me the money that they owe me. They called me and  wanted me to change back from DirecTV to Comcast, One word is my answer, never! They are beyond incompetent. They have caused me lots of wasted time and owe me $7.26. They have sent me to a collection agency even though they verify that they owe me money and I owe them nothing."
"Dustin of Villa Rica, GA",3/29/2010,,"What has not happened with this company? The speed advertised is not even close to what you get. When you do get a decent speed it is only burst speed soon to fade away. They complicate any and everything imaginable for a home network. I had to call them to unblock it the day it was set up, amazing. They lied about the free netbook for signing up. I signed up and they say I never signed a contract I never received so I said I will cancel your service then. The verbal contract says I will pay a fee or get submitted to the credit agencies. They have no Quality Assurance Team. The employees are arrogant and my service will probably glitch before I click submit. They definitely let you know customer service isn't needed in every industry! I hate you Comcast!"
"Charles of Sacramento, CA",3/31/2010,,"We thought our family could enjoy Vonage, with our 5gb Verizon Internet; but was told, they would have to set us up with Comcast cable Internet, whom they worked with! We sure are thankful we did not cancel the Verizon USB727-5gb-Internet. Comcast's hook-up caused E's Alarm System plus, all 5-AT&T land-line phones through out our home to shut down. We did not to realize that Comcast, was that dumb ! On March-01-2010 (took 21 days to get my AT&T,+ alarm back ) when Comcast walked away, the only 1 phone our family had was a poor reception phone in our out back computer room, requiring their Internet left on. What a nightmare!  Now it looks like Comcast-Cable wants to bill $64.52, the family for their nightmare, called for by Vonage ! We should go on line & warn 23 million vets! "
"Lee of Colorado Springs, CO",4/1/2010,,"I am told that while a Comcast installer was installing in my upstairs neighbor's condominium, he entered my condominium while I was not home and without permission.  I was told this by the neighbor who was having equipment installed.  I see no evidence of any damage.  It is just that this is a gated community and I resent anyone taking such liberties."
"Elizabeth of Portsmouth, NH",4/1/2010,,"In July 2009, my 'special package' rate that was initiated one year earlier expired. My monthly rate for cable and phone services shot up. I called the company and was set up with a new package price for the same services. I was satisfied with the conditions of the new package and told that i must agree with a 10% increase in July of 2010, in order to get the new package rate. I agreed and signed an agreement letter and returned it to Comcast.Six months later, I received a bill with a retroactive charge that amount to a significant amount of money, as well as an increased monthly rate. I called and over several hours of conversation and email, I was told that Comcast would resolved the issue, but was having trouble finding the right 'package' price to suit my need. They indicated that the original pricing was incorrect. As i continued to receive increased bills, I was told that they were still working to resolve and adjust the rate.Then, after a period of time with no further response or reduction in the bills to my agreed-upon rate, Comcast changed their tune and told me that they would not honor the agreed rate. not only did they raise the rate but plan to continue to increase the new rate by 10% in July 2010. I feel that they didn't honor their agreement and still expect me to pay the increased rate in the annual increase. I would like them to adjust my bills to the agreed upon rate. My monthly bill is now 17 dollars/month higher, and the 10% increase in July will be based on the higher rate."
"Caitlin of Westtown, PA",4/1/2010,,"ComCast was out puttering in the box on my property months ago, trying to fix a neighbor's service problems. When they do this, they never knock on the door and say that the service will go out on a temporary basis. It's just gone. Everything: phone, Internet and TV. After this event, we started to have intermittent problems.On the phone almost every day, resetting Internet modem. Then it was claimed that the computer modem was going bad. They won't send one in the mail. This is their own equipment but they won't bring another one and install it without a service charge, and they won't send one in the mail for self-installation without a service fee either. I have to drive to the local office, 20 miles round trip on my gas, to get one. Well, that didn't fix anything, certainly not the TV and not the Internet either.Now, the nearly daily service calls start, ""The problem is not in the house. It's in the box. I'll get maintenance out to fix it. You won't have to be home. No charge."" Maintenance comes, who supposed to call first, but doesn't. ""You weren't home so I left."" Another technician is scheduled. ""Oh, the first guy got it wrong -- you've got a loose wire here in the house on your connection to the wall socket and I'll put this new connector on. No charge. Oh, and I'll give you a credit because the guy who was here earlier got it wrong. All fixed now."" No, it isn't, same problems an hour later and a $30 charge on the bill because the fix is said to be my fault. I spent an hour on the phone to get that reversed.Next technician appointment: ""I'm calling because you have an appointment. It's working right now? Oh, then it won't help for me to come -- can't help you if it's fine right now. Call when you have trouble again."" Call goes out two hours later: it's down again. ""We don't have anyone available until next week and you'll have to be home. Sorry about that. Call us again and ask for a credit when it's fixed.""Wait again for someone to come. ""Oh, there's nothing wrong in the house, the problem is in the box. I'll call maintenance and you won't have a service charge."" Yeah, that's what the service guy a month ago said. Maintenance shows up: ""The connector is broken in the box -- gotta get you a new one. We don't have the part with us. We will be back."" Four days later, someone is back. Finally the intermittancies stop.Check the bill: there's a $30 service charge on the bill for that fix. Meanwhile, charges for monthly TV service just doubled: whatever plan we have been on has expired. There's been no improvement whatsoever in TV service but the fee is now doubled and for the past several months, since the intermittancy started, the TV has been out along with the phone and the Internet whenever the broken piece in the box wiggled enough when the wind was blowing to interrupt the line.""Oh, I apologize for the charge and I'll take it off. Service charges are automatically billed to the customer unless the service tech files an invoice after the call which adjusts the automatic charge. Guess he didn't do that in this instance."" Come to find out: part of the pay for the service techs comes from the amount of money the tech can charge off to the customer on problems which are said to be the customer's problems. So the guy who claimed we needed a ""new"" connector at the wall was a liar: claimed the problem was a loose connection at the wall when it was, all the time, in the box outside. He was trying to find any possible reason to make the customer pay so he made up something to claim the problem was with the customer's equipment he got paid more in his paycheck for saving ComCast money by lying and blaming the customer."
"David of Indianapolis, IN",4/2/2010,,"The television freezes up. Internet service does not work, on demand does not work correctly. Service technicians have been here several times in the past eight months, but problem returns hours after they leave. When I go to use on demand it does not work, and if it does it will not work for 2 hours straight. comcast has done nothing but increased my bill to $190.00 per month and then they critize me cause its working when they arrive. when i call about it they make me go thru the same procedure of resetting the box etc. that takes about an hour, but no results."
"Richard of Haverhill, ma",4/2/2010,,"I have been harassed by Comcast and threatened to have my internet disconnected for supposedly too much internet usage.  They shot an obscene number of gigs which they are claiming my family uses more space that my hard-drive even contains.  I was told when I signed up for Comcast that there was no limit to downloading and just for the record, I do not download anything illegal.  If I download something it's because I payed for it or I download virus protections and software updates.  When I asked to have this sent in writing, they completely denied me.  They said that they don't send that stuff out!  If they are not sending their customers download limits, then how are we supposed to know?  They told me whether or not I pay for it, they don't allow it.  Isn't that a breach of contract under Comcast's fault? I use my computer for business purposes the majority of the time and I have a disabled child that is computer dependent because of severe handwritten skills; he needs the computer.  Comcast and their phone operators did not wish to comply with my requests at all.  What can I do and what are my rights?"
"Robert of Port norris, nj",4/2/2010,,"Back on March 15, 2010, I spoke to a CSR named Diana via the internet on Comcast's website to address the issue that Comcast sent me a letter threatening to disconnect my services. She was to have made a notation on my account that a payment would be made on my account on March 20, 2010 and there would be no disconnection. There was never no disruption in my services and they promised payment was made on said day in the amount of $50.I then received my bill (billing date 3/20/2010) with a late payment fee and a reconnection charge. I called Comcast on April 1, 2010 and spoke to a supervisor named Brandon and he claimed that my services were disconnected on March 20, 2010 and have not had service since said date. I told him that there was never a disruption in my service and that I wouldn't be talking to him because I have VOIP. I said that I would like the reconnection fee and late payment charge removed. He refused and still claims I have no service. I have documentation that they still bill me for services they claim are disconnected. I have a copy of the chat I had with CSR Diana on 03/15/2010 and I have a receipt of my payment for 03/20/2010."
"Nancy of Chicago, IL",4/3/2010,,"Comcast cable would not fix my cable, out of service for a long time. Supervisors need to do a good job. Misael supervisor is not solving my problem. I have no cable for over a week and none available to come out."
"Gerry of Whiting, NJ",4/3/2010,,"Comcast Local Edition Program segment doesn't cover my area where I live and doesn't represent a DSN (Distant Market Network). It interrupts HLN channel at an inappropriate cut off. When Comcast Local Edition isn't on, it cuts into HLN last segment program two minutes after it started because of Comcast local commercials. HLN denies that Comcast should do the cut in late into their segment shows and denies they should do Comcast Local Edition. Loss contracts of other residents to Satellite. Local channels by Comcast requires a converter box. Comcast also dropped local channels in my area and we have in result higher cable bill. "
"Sam of Appling, GA",4/3/2010,,"I was calling to let them know about a problem with my bill, a charge of a movie that I did not order. After contacting the Augusta, GA office, this customer service person named KC was rude and told me to shut up and listen and let him finish his sentence and proceeded to call me a liar and say I ordered the movie. First of all, I have been a loyal customer with Comcast for many years. Second, I am in customer service myself and would never treat a customer in this manner. I spoke with a supervisor, William and he was not any help either. They created my account but stated they could never do that again and would note it on my account. *** people. You could tell by my account I never ordered any movies for money. I only watched free movies, period! I think it is time for people to go back to the basics of customer service. Learn how to treat a customer. And to all you, young people, without customers, you have no job and no paycheck! "
"Christine of Oxford, CT",4/5/2010,,"We have been having trouble with our internet for over a year. The connections keep getting disconnected. We have called and spent over anywhere from 4hrs to 8hrs with a tech trying to help. We have continued to ask from a technician to be sent to the house. We are told that someone will have to call us back because they can't schedule the appointment. The last time we were trying to get a repair person to come to the house, we spent all day over 8 hrs. The cell phone battery went dead (The Call started with a full batteries), then had to change over another phone.The tech. we talked to finally agreed, that it was not just the wireless and that even with a direct connection to the computer we were loosing connection. But the best he could do even after being on the phone and on hold, he could not schedule an appointment and would have to have someone call us. We still are losing connection and no one is calling and we can't get anyone to come out. Why do we stay with them? Because that is our only option. We have to call AT&T and were told that they are not fast in our area yet but would let us know when. We have missed important information. This is very aggravating. A friend who is staying with us is unable to get work information. "
"Michael of Bellevue, WA",4/5/2010,,"We had been long time Comcast customers who always paid on time. However, we were traveling overseas and had difficultly getting payments to Comcast. We missed their notices of late payment. When we did pay the amount in full on our return, Comcast had disconnected our services and released our telephone number of 14 years. They could not restore the number for us as it was ""out of the pool."" "
"Cristian of Leesburg, FL",4/9/2010,,"I scheduled cable service to be installed around 9-12 on a Tuesday morning. No one ever called or showed up between those times. I called Comcast to find out what happened and the rep said the tech noted that he could not find my location. I asked why he didn't call me and she replied that he did and I did not answer which I thought was strange as I had the phone next to me all morning and I made no calls and no other calls came in. The rep said she sent an email to dispatch to try to get someone out to me and would call me back in 20 minutes. 40 minutes later, still no call.I called back and the rep said that dispatch had not responded and she would call me back in another 20 minutes. At this point, I am getting furious as I am wasting my whole day waiting for the tech. She said she could reschedule my appointment and I stated that I should not have to do that as I already had an appointment that the tech did not service! She said the only thing I could do then was wait for dispatch. Finally, at 4:30 in the afternoon, a tech shows up to install my service and he did not even have the correct equipment. I had ordered two DVRs and he brought one regular digital cable box! He said I would have to make another appointment to get the DVRs that I ordered. Absolutely, Iâ€™m just fed up. I called and made another appointment for today 9-12. Surprise, surprise, no one showed up and no one called.I called Comcast to find out what happened this time and he informs me that there is no appointment scheduled on my account! Seriously?! This is such poor customer service! These people have no idea what they are doing! If another service provider was available to me, I would change companies. Unfortunately, Comcast is the only provider for my location. If I want cable I am stuck with Comcast! So as of now, I have another appointment for tomorrow. I asked the rep to send me a confirmation letter for my appointment to my email. He said that their system wasn't capable to do that. Are you kidding me? So I say, â€œOkay, can you just give me a verbal appointment confirmation number then?â€ I got the reply of no to that as well. Honestly, I don't know how Comcast stays in business! As for my appointment tomorrow, I won't hold my breath! "
"Charles of Puyallup, WA",4/10/2010,,"Contacted Comcast customer service option ""downgrade or disconnect service"". When greeted, the customer service agent quickly began quoting to me that the law required this or the law required that very matter-of-factly. The last thing I wanted to have was a lecture from a twenty-something little twit that has no clue what she is talking about, but simply gone through her 3-day training seminar at Comcast. Bottom line: I have moved out of state, will not continue service, nor do I plan on paying for a contract they say exists but cannot find a copy of a signed document. Suffice it to say I will not do business with Comcast ever regardless if I have no other options."
"Donald of Wilmington, DE",4/11/2010,,"Comcast is dishonest! Within a couple of weeks after my triple-play ""promotional rate"" of $141 ended, I called them to see if there were any other promotions I could get on. I was told there were by a rep from their ""Customer Retention"" division. He told me he would put me on a $122 (and change) rate, and it would be effective as of the end of my promotional rate.I also got a letter from Comcast, 2 days after that call saying that ""as a valued customer"", I would be getting at $10 triple-play credit for as long as I maintained my current level of service, and a $25 ""valued customer"" credit on every bill for the next 12 months. Turns out the total $35 credit reduced the ""regular"" charges to, guess what--$122! I thought I was getting a ""deal"", but it was no deal because I was just getting the reduced bill for being a ""valued customer"".But when the bill came, it was for $157. Called Comcast and was told that I was not on any new promotional rate. IOW, the rep lied or was incompetent and did not put me on the new rate. I mentioned the letter I had gotten from Comcast, and guess what the rep said? ""That letter was sent to you in error!"" At that point, I exploded, which I rarely do on the phone. After that, she said (again) that I was switched to the new promotional rate. But when I accessed my bill online, it was still just short of $157.Talked to another rep and was told that my new bill was $113.28. I asked if that's true, why does it still show $156 and change when I access it? She said the credit would show on the next bill. Bull feathers! As as result of this exchange, I terminated my auto-pay, which I've had for many years, to prevent Comcast from taking more out of my bank account than they're due. I instead sent them a check for the $113.28, which they cashed a couple of days ago and my account now shows a balance of $127 and change. In addition to the credits I was supposed to get, I had called a Comcast technician to investigate a problem with our TV reception. He arrived late, and told me there would be a $20 credit on my next bill. No such credit ever showed up."
"Andrew of Brewster, NY",4/11/2010,,"I have a bill 594. I put in mail for 500. They are saying that they never got it. I am SSI, so I only can send one payment a month. I did not even pay my rent because of this bill. The bank is doing a trace on the money order. Please help us. I can send a payment May 1 for 500."
"Christina of Sacramento, CA",4/12/2010,,"I cannot give specific names because we have dealt with a number of customer service representatives and supervisors since August when we began service with Comcast again reluctantly due to not having another provider in our address.  We have had one problem after another with this company with constant hidden costs added to our bill, violations of our contract that to this day is not at the price we signed up for.  Comcast members give us numerous excuses every month why they charged us all these different costs. In the beginning, they made us sign a second contract because they lost the first one, thus, raising the price by a third of the cost.  We have numerous problems with the service; six technicians were later at our house and they gave us one excuse after another again as to why our service is still problematic. Our current issue is still a bill with overcharges which is still not at the contracted rate and a picture which is regularly freezing.  Their own technician stated that our problems now with viewing are due to the lines outside needing replacement.  The job needed to be completed in 48 hours due to it being a violation of some state code. A week later, after they asked us to give them access to our backyard to fix the problem, they have not done anything and when we call them, they stated that they have no record of this conversation by their own technician and supervisor even though their technician was at our home.  This problem has been going on for about a month and now they are telling us that they need to send another technician out to evaluate the same problem.  Basically, this is a repeat of what had already been done with no resolution.We are concerned that Comcast has formed a monopoly in service in this area and is often allowed to get away with very unethical practices.  We had Comcast a number of years ago and left their service due to similar billing and service issues.  It was to the point that I honestly considered getting an attorney.  We were stuck to use them again due to the company; we are not being allowed to have service in our area.  I have spoken with many other users of Comcast who reported very similar issues with no resolution.  What is a consumer like me supposed to do with a company that can get away with constant inconsistencies in what they say and do?  They overcharge people, they violate their own contracts and give every excuse as to why they can do that.Recently, they were charging people $8.00 for the box and if you wanted to use the box, an additional $7.50.  It is a hidden cost that most people would not understand that basically makes the user pay $15.50 for the box on each TV.  They are charging for the service, the use of the box, and the signal to the box.  It is a duplicate cost which brought them in millions of dollars.  We called them on it and were told by Comcast that they were no longer going to charge this and would remove it from our bill.  As in previous bills, the adjustment and credits have not been made.  Me and my husband have taken time off work to be here for their technicians who have not resolved the issues that we have.  We have continuously overpaid since August with not one correct bill since then.  I have been promised a credit that I am still waiting to see on my bill. "
"Brian of Shillington, PA",4/13/2010,,"Everyone was told when the digital conversion took place last year that we had to get rid of our old analog sets so we could view all but the pay channels. Now this year, Comcast comes back and says you will not be able to see anything but basic cable without one of their digital boxes. They gave us three but we have a large family and have to pay monthly for more. Just another fee for them to make money off of. Now we are paying for a service we can no longer watch on all our TVs throughout our home without paying Comcast's extortion money. More cost for cable TV. People in older homes having to load up receptacles to add on powered converters."
"Laurie of Bridgeton, NJ",4/14/2010,,"On March 30, 2010, I paid my bill but meant to pay only the past due. The entire amount was paid. So I called and spoke to a very nice customer service rep from the Caribbean. I can't remember her name. She took my information and submitted my request for my bank account to be credited. On April 7th, I called to find out why my account had not been credited and she said that it was not yet. So I waited another week and I called today, April 14th, and I spoke with another rep. Never at any time when I spoke to a woman did she say that she was resubmitting the request for my refund. She then passed me off to billing because she couldn't give me an answer as to why my account hadn't been credited. So I spoke with another rep and he tells me that it is still sitting there waiting so he was doing another ""ticket"". I was none too happy then. I asked him, ""Why are you doing it now when it should have been done the first time, then the second time and now your doing it again? I asked for supervisor. He was clueless. He could not give me an answer. I told him that I wanted an answer as to why it has been two weeks and my account has not been credited. He could not tell me. I asked him why he could not call the billing dept. He said that the billing dept doesn't handle it. I asked him who did and why can't he call and find out what was going on. He said that that office is ""blocked"" and he could not call. He kept insisting that it would take 3-5 days from this date to get my refund and I insisted that it should have been done on the 29-30th. Why is it being done two weeks later? I have the ticket numbers and confirmation numbers if needed."
"Michael of Camino, CA",4/14/2010,,"I am forced to go with Comcast in our area as we don't have another provider. When I first moved into our home 8+ years ago we had AT&T cable and was very happy. They removed service from our area so I picked up the only provider in the area, Comcast. It has been one headache after another. They charge me for things they cannot even explain (one time fees). Their packages are filled with a bunch of junk channels with just a few you may watch and that's all part of the package which you pay for. My Comcast bill is always close to $150 for what amounts to basic channels. We have had a box in a separate room we are paying for that they have not been able to make work, one excuse after another. Isn't there a way to give people like me a choice? It's pretty bad when your cable bill is higher than your electric bill. They bundle packages together that forces you to pay a higher price for your cable. We should have a choice as to what we want to watch without being forced to pay for a bunch of junk!"
"Gary of San Francisco, CA",4/18/2010,,"Comcast breached my privacy and put my personal security at risk by setting up my home network as a public wireless network which was accessible by over 14 other computers in my immediate location and also published my phone number after requesting that it not be. I have asked to speak with a supervisor on 5 different occasions and have either been placed on permanent hold, hung up on or told I would get a call back which never happens. I am very concerned that they can be so careless with others privacy and security. This resulted in hours and hours of stress and possible identity theft."
"S. of Santa Rosa, CA",4/18/2010,,"I moved from Novato to Santa Rosa. When I set up my Santa Rosa service and spoke to a rep by phone later, I was told they would use the same account number. This turns out to be false information. I made payments by electronic banking to the same (old) account number for 4 mos. with no problem. In March I got an overdue notice for 2 mos. service, then paid the overdue by electronic banking. They marked my account overdue nonetheless as it was paid to the old number. Only after repeated phone calls do I find out that in fact I have a new account number. They also did not send paper bills for the last 2 mos. or at least I have not received them. Today I found out after 20 min. on the phone with their collections dept. that they have sent me a refund check for the paid amount sent to the wrong acct. number, and so I still owe them. I paid this amount by credit card. I also asked about a promotion I should be eligible for, but I am told I am not eligible because my account is overdue. I work with Comcast on behalf of my clients and the universal sentiment is that they have no idea what they're doing. In my case now I have a record of not paying on time, which technically is not true as I did not receive a billing statement, nor did they notify me of the overdue for almost 2 & 1/2 mos. I have repeatedly tried to get them to send notices to my main email account (not Comcast account, but domain mail) and they say fine, we'll do that, but it never happens."
"George of Cape Coral, FL",4/21/2010,,"The serviced provided did not meet the advertised product. The company also disregards what they advertise and have you purchase, therefore making you spend money for nothing. I was overcharged for base services and had to buy other products listed on their website, and they will not acknowledge their mistake, nor credit my account."
"Ramsey of Jacksonville, FL",4/21/2010,,"1st issue: I had Comcast internet from my work for about 3 yrs, then my job decided not to pay for our internet any longer. So, they gave us a choice between transferring the connection to our name or shutting it off and calling ourselves to turn it back on. I told them to transfer, but when they finally did it, it was in mid month and there was no email or regular piece of mail going out, notifying us of what speed we were paying for, what date it was transferred, anything. I got a bill saying that I owed $200+ for the first bill because my company didn't pay for the full month and I owed for a month and a half. So, I went back and forth, finally, saying that you can shove it because I was never told by anyone what I was supposed to pay. I mean you don't walk into a dealership and just say I want that Porsche GT4 without looking at the price, right?! So, I returned the modem and moved to another address.Issue 2: Comcast equipment retrieval department is calling me, saying I never returned the modem. Two months of this! The rep asks if I have my receipt. I said ""from what?! 2 months ago?... NO! "" I asked why they can't look up to see what the other Comcast reps can see because they said, I have no equipment still, under my last address and they said because we can't see their records... hmm. Now, that seems to me, that the equipment department should be the ones with the most recent data... am I crazy?! The calling continues....Issue 3: I got home and my bedroom television that I have set all the channels that it will get, is missing about 30 channels. This is in the new address that I moved in... So, I rolled my eyes and called 1800comcast and talk to this rep that told me that I'm gonna need a box to get those channels now. I said that""s **. I opened this agreement with the idea, that these were my channels, but no... he said that they've moved those missing channels to a digital package and I'll need a box, thinking I'm going to have to pay more a month for each box I get **. So, finally after raging this idiot he said ""Well, you can just go by the Comcast store and get ""as many as you need"" for your house"". ""As many as I need"", so I said ""okay"" and hung up. I just got back from the Comcast store today and you know what the lady behind the counter said?.. ""You can only have two, since your DVR is a box and a DVR is considered as 2 boxes and my plan only allows 4 boxes... sigh... So, I just said give me the ** boxes and took my happy ** in the car and drove back to work **.Bottom line, nobody at Comcast knows ** is going on. Nobody! They are a bunch of liars and I can't wait for the day that they have competition, because I'll be the first one to switch. By the way, this was over a 3 month period that I've been dealing with all of this. Physical damage was to my brain and all the time that I spent on the phone that I will never get back... I could've been having sex or scratching my **."
"Betty of Kentwood, MI",4/21/2010,,"Well, I've just got Comcast. Now, I wish I never did. Each time I called in for help, I got the runaround. I'm going to have to look up another telephone and internet service but come on now. if you cannot help a person, don't act like you know what you are doing and you don't. Comcast, don't do it. It sounds good, but it is not."
"Lynn of Lakewood, CO",4/22/2010,,"Iâ€™ve just discovered an additional charge on my bill for Comcast Performance Plus. When I signed up, the amount was supposed to be $42.95 a month but later they added this additional $10 fee for Comcast Performance Plus without even asking or telling me about it. The charge is hidden that when you have paperless billing, you can find it but you really have to dig for it."
"Josette of Houston, TX",4/23/2010,,"I do not have service or account with Comcast. There's a service box in the right corner of my backyard.  This box is used to connect cable and phone service to the other three homes that is adjacent to me. I am a Dish network customer. I went out to look at what needed to be done to repair my gate on February 12, 2010.  While I was out, the meter reader for the gas and light was reading the meters. On February 13, 20010, the gate door was remove and repaired for the third time in 6 months and lock. On February 17, I was sitting at my desk and heard the gate swung open and close.  Somebody busted the gate open. The next day, I wired before the gate close. By Saturday, the gate was swinging open and closes again. My mother is their 24 hours a day. That Saturday, I ask my neighbor and mother, who entered the yard. They told me that Comcast was there three times that per week.I called Comcast about a repair and spoke to ** @ 9:4 am on the 1st of March.I called on the 4th and they said that will try to cancel our savings .  I called again on the 4th and they said that they will call in 48hrs. I called again on the 8th.  I called again on the 10th at 4:32pm and they gave the direct number to **, a claims representative. He never answers my calls.  On April 7, I spoke to ** but until now, I have not gotten a response about repairing my gate.One of the Comcast employees continues to enter my entrance gate to my backyard by force. My mother is home 24hrs."
"Susie of Belmont, CA",4/23/2010,,"Comcast is encrypting channels and lying about how/when/why. They claim the FCC mandate required that they encrypt (i.e. scramble) channels like A&E, Food Network, USA, Comedy, History, etc. They are claiming I need to purchase/rent their descrambler equipment to receive channels which I pay for and which I have received for years. I pay for the ""extended channel line up"" which includes the above channels, and I am not able to receive these channels. When I called to complain about the lack of service, I have heard every ridiculous excuse, from ""sun spots"" to ""satellite upgrade"" to digital-to-analog FCC mandate, etc. Their DTA (descrambler) box negates the use of my new digital TV features such as picture-in-picture and HD signal quality. Since my TVs are digital, I neither need nor want their digital-to-analog converter (DTA) boxes. The nationwide announcement about the analog-to-digital signal conversion, stated clearly that consumers would need the converter box only if they had an analog TV on an antenna. Comcast required the converter box for any analog TV. This is far beyond the nationwide announcement. Now Comcast is claiming that I need a converter box (which I now understand to be a descrambler) regardless of whether my TVs are analog or digital. Most of all, Comcast has been very dishonest about what they are doing, claiming all of their requirements are actually a part of the FCC mandate. Note that when I tried Comcast's converter (DTA, descrambler) box on my digital TV, it caused my TV to receive 1 analog channel and 0 digital channels. I currently get less than 1/2 of the channels that I pay for and I get nothing but ridiculous stories from Comcast about why. I would think that A&E and Food Network, etc, would be upset to know that their viewing community has been chopped to pieces by Comcast's dishonest/scrambled service program. Please help."
"Diana of Philadelphia, PA",4/24/2010,,"Comcast is the most terrible cable service provider out there. I encourage everyone to go with Clear, Verizon, or any other service available. First, I did not realize that every time a technician came out to fix a problem that I would automatically incur a service charge. Why did I not think I would incur a service charge? Because the problem was Comcast's fault from the beginning. When I first chose Comcast as my service provider (which may change in about 2 weeks), I had a technician come out to install a cable. Unbeknownst to me, the technician proved to be incompetent and did not wire my house properly. Time passed, and my internet connection worsened. Thinking it was my router, I happily accepted a Comcast router (that I paid a $10 shipping fee which they neglected to tell me about). The problem stopped for a time. After some bad rainstorms featuring high winds, the problems began again. Thinking I could call Comcast for help, I decided to do so. They sent a technician out. He was a great tech, and he fixed my problem by re-wiring the faulty wire. He told me that the initial tech sent out had not done the job properly and so the wire had become loose through wind, rain, snow, etc. (you can imagine Philadelphia winters). So, in the end, I am paying an additional fee (that I am not happy about) for something that was not my fault to begin with. Thank you, Comcast, for your spectacularly terrible customer service."
"Vincent of Colorado Springs, CO",4/24/2010,,"The salesperson stated there was no installation fee. Comcast then billed me a $99 installation fee. I communicated with 2 customer service agents who both said they would take care of it, but did not. The third agent (retention agent) stated they would not waive the fee. "
"Johnny of Westernport, MD",4/25/2010,,"My son lived with me after coming home from the navy and he didnâ€™t like my dial up internet connection. He offered to get high speed in his name and he would pay the bill, so he did. Now my son no longer lives here so I tried to get service in my name. Comcast says that I will have to pay his outstanding bill, which he has refused to pay because he says the company actually owes him a refund. Now I am being held responsible for his bill and cannot get service or my rebate for equipment purchased for $100.00 unless I pay his bill up to date. Is this even legal? Am I now an unpaid employee for Comcast as a debt collector? Can I now legally send Comcast a bill for services rendered? This is not the complete story. Iâ€™ve shortened it considerably. Iâ€™m just sick of the whole mess. This has been going on now for about 11 weeks. I just want it to end."
"Misty of Albuquerque, NM",4/25/2010,,"On three separate occasions, I waited for someone to come bury my cable. I had to be here because I have dogs in the backyard, which I explained to them. The first two times, the technician called me and tried to get me to come home from work because he didnâ€™t want to work that late in the afternoon. He didn't show up for his appointment and then lied to Comcast and canceled my appointment.Then Comcast made another ""appointment"", this time it was a window from 8 am to 7 pm on a Saturday. I waited all day. Did they show up? They did not. Each time I called to complain, I would talk or ""chat"" with a customer service rep who would read the same useless apology from the same useless script.  Their ""chat"" customer service was awful. They were clearly using a script and had no idea what time it was here."
"Anna of Huntsville, AL",4/26/2010,,"I subscribed to Comcast DVR service about 2 years ago. Since that time, I've had to have them replace my box 3 times due to its problems. The last box they issued me last week will not record the last 30 seconds to 1 minute of any program I attempt to record. Often this is the most important part of any program. I just called, and their answer was ""Yes, that happens sometimes."" This is unacceptable, as it happens on every program whether it's a pre-programmed recording or if I just press the record button to get a program in process. I have been a Comcast customer for about 10 years and also have a business account with them as I'm a professional web designer. They take about $200 of my money each money, and this is the best they can offer. In my opinion, the big wigs sit up in some home office, raking in the bucks and don't care what the customer is experiencing. They ought to be made to do better. I will probably discontinue my service, buy a TiVo box, and subscribe to this service."
"Hamilton of Fort Myers, FL",4/26/2010,,"I have been with Comcast for many years. I had a problem with a set-top box and tech support told me to swap it at their office. Not only was I given a non-functional device that I had to swap during a second visit, they told me my rate was going up more than $50 for the same services I have had for years. They told me that the rate I had been paying for years was incorrect and I would be required to pay at least $50 more per month. They have lied many times in the past and I think they are lying now. I continue to pay the old rate ($174.35) but I am afraid of retribution. Giants can be mean and vindictive. What can I do? Thank you. Although the services provided by Comcast are fine, their pricing is not competitive and I will be forced to reconfigure everything (at my expense) if they do not honor their earlier commitment."
"Susie of Belmont, CA",4/27/2010,,"Comcast has employed needless, stupid operating-system specific limitations on their Internet service. They support only three operating systems--two windows and one mac. Since there are over 150 computer operating systems in the world, including some very commonly used only like Unix and Linux, this makes no sense. Since network packets are operating system generic, there is no reason to impose limitations like this. I don't know of any other Internet vendor who does this."
"Teresa of Wernersville, PA",4/27/2010,,"I was told in January that I wouldn't get a bill for 5 months after the service was activated and installed. I have had to call Comcast cable out to fix the installation and the reps told me that I would not only get the total install credited but also credits for other problems with my account. There are many calls to Comcast made by me because the credits weren't applied to my bill like I was told. I was also told today that with new service, they do not interrupt services until 3 months had past with nonpayment. I was told this because I complained about the bill coming in January when it was told to me that it wouldn't come until 5 weeks after the install on Jan. 2. So that would make the first bill come in February. My service is now turned off and this isn't the end of April yet. I have been making payment and the credits that Comcast has applied are also payments. So my service should still be on. I have been trying to resolve this Comcast turn off situation and I believe Comcast is at fault and my service should be immediately restore. I talked with Jennifer, who is a supervisor, today and she said that my bill for 4 months of service should roughly be $887.00. I asked her to calculate with me the amount that I had paid with the credits that she said she saw and then subtract that from the $887 for the 4 months service. $126 was paid on Feburary 12, plus $306.70 paid on March 12th and the credits that Jennifer said she saw was about $165.00.If you calculate all of that, it equals $597.70, subtract that total from the $887.00 that Jennifer stated is the roughly totaled charges for my 4 months and that leaves $289.30, which would be due in May not April. Per the only suspension letter I have ever gotten, it stated that if I paid the $306.70 by March 17 and it was received by no later than March 21, my service wouldn't be interrupted. As you can see, that payment was made on March 12. Please restore my service ASAP."
"Roland of Bloomington, IN",4/29/2010,,"My cable modem which I purchased from Insight Communications, the company Comcast took over from, stopped working. I had no way of knowing it was the modem because it was indicating as if it was trying to connect to the internet. A technician came and said that it was probably the modem. After buying a new one, all worked fine.Apparently, we were supposed to pay about $2 more per month for their ""Wire Service Insurance"" which makes no sense. It wasn't my fault the equipment stopped working. All, the technician did was test their cable system. Comcast, also jacked prices up. For a long while Insight prices were $40/month. It was so for a while as Comcast took over. Then they increased the prices in October to $42.95 without any reason for it.Now, they are jacking up prices again to $59.99 + ($1.99 for insurance) to some $60/month. That's a 50% price increase in less than a year and it is totally unfair and unreasonable. My main concern is with their shady practices, and not informing a customer about the service charge for anything. That's something I haven't agreed to."
"Arif of Fremont, CA",4/29/2010,,"I signed up for the Comcast 3 bundled deal with a free netbook back in early August 2009, and till today I still have not received the free offer netbook Comcast promised. I called Comcast on 09/30/09 to follow up on the netbook, and they said have to wait for 3 months. I called again sometime in Nov 2009 and on 01/07/10. The rep still have no records regarding the netbook, and asked me to check on checkmyrebate which left me nowhere either, since the check rebate site always was showing ""no records"". So on 01/10/10, I called Comcast and the 800 numbers on checkmyrebate, and still none of the reps have a clue or have info regarding when I'll be getting the netbook. Today, it's almost May 2010. Yet, I still have not gotten the netbook and none of the Comcast personnel can help, nor have info, nor have a clue regarding this offer. This is really getting frustrating and annoying. I really feel I'm being cheated by the Comcast free netbook offer just to get people signed up with them with a 24-month contract that you cannot break. I really believe this is really not a good business practice for such a big company like Comcast, and I really do hope someone could help me solve this issue along with the rest of the people that are having the same or similar complaint about Comcast online. Thank you. "
"Sudeep of Jersey City, NJ",5/1/2010,,"I have been a Comcast customer since August 2008. I live in the 700 Grove condominium building which has a bulk subscription arrangement with Comcast. According to this arrangement, the maintenance fee that we pay subsidizes part of the total monthly subscription fee that residents of 700 Grove pay to Comcast on an individual basis. I was completely unaware of this until very recently. I spoke to a customer representative who was very helpful and mentioned that I had indeed overpaid from the time I started the subscription but she could only give credit ($ 357.48) for six months and informed me that that my monthly bill should be $32.90 instead of the $ 75.91 that I currently pay every month. I think this is very unfair as I have unwittingly been paying more than double of what I should have paid for the past 20 months. I should get full credit going back all the way since I started being a customer in August 2008 instead of the 6-month credit that I am being given. I am also quite disappointed because I think Comcast should have alerted me that I was overpaying as I was a resident of 700 Grove with which they have a special bulk arrangement. I would appreciate your prompt assistance and response in this regard. I have been over paying Comcast since August 2008 for the approximate amount of $903."
"Harry of Monterey, CA",5/4/2010,,"We started service (telephone/cable/internet) on 2/27/2010 with Comcast. For some unauthorized reason, Comcast opened two (2) accounts with two (2) account numbers under our name. I called them as soon as I discovered this error. We received two (2) bills in the mail on the same day. They told me they would forward the information to the accounting dept. and it would take 5-7 business days until one (1) of the accounts would be completely deleted from their system. They informed me which account number to use. I also told them that I had made a payment already over the phone with my credit card.They discovered the payment got credited to the account that was to be deleted. They told me since the account was to be deleted, I would be mailed a check for the payment I made to them. I told them to just transfer my payment from the deleted account to the other account. They told me they could not do that. I also wanted to order a router. I was now told, because my account is showing up as ""past due account,"" I would not be able to place that order until my account was brought to current. I already made a payment! It was not my fault they applied my payment to the wrong account. There was no option on the automated phone system to choose which account to make a payment to. I was told by the installation guys that worked for Comcast that I could get a router free through Comcast but just pay $9.95 for shipping.I was quoted over the phone a $15 charge for the router but when I mentioned the price the installation guys gave me, they hesitated but told me that was correct. I received the check in the mail for the full amount I paid over the phone ($174). I've made two (2) payments (a total of $401) to Comcast since I started service on 2/27/2010. My bill every month should be $160. I can see my first bill being slightly high due to installation and new service charges but they keep sending me a bill for the account that was suppose to be deleted in 5-7 business days. It had now been almost a month! I called again to inform them about the whole mess up and I was basically told there was nothing they could do about it and I owe another $401! I asked to speak with a supervisor because they were not understanding what was going on and I needed to speak with management about this problem. I was placed on hold for five (5) minutes. The same person got on the phone and told me there was nothing they could do for me. I have all the names and  dates and times I spoke with people at Comcast. And I've gotten notices ""Make payment before service is shut off."" I'm going to be out $400 + because Comcast is double billing me."
"Mehdi of Davie, FL",5/4/2010,,"I previously had a Comcast service for $25 per month. A few month ago, all of a sudden our service was interrupted. I contacted Comcast and they told me that I had to upgrade my system which I did and I greed to pay about $36 per month. This month all of a sudden I received a bill for $67 from Comcast. The salesperson of Comcast specifically explained to me over the phone that the charge would be only $35. When I complained, I was told that I agreed with $67 after a few months. This is an outright lie by Comcast. I never agreed to pay $67 either implied or expressed. Shame on Comcast. Their conduct is unethical. I guess they do this without any shame or fear of Federal Trade commission. "
"Jessica of Hummelstown , PA",5/5/2010,,"I recently had to view my bill online. I transferred my services from another physical property address last year. When I logged in to view my bill, I saw last yearâ€™s bill that showed the account paid in full. When I contact customer support, the employee should have taken care of switching my email address to the new account. Since they did not, I was reassigned another email which I have no knowledge of and do not have access to.Not to mention, that now not only do I have the inconvenience of not being able to access my email, I also cannot change my email address on other sites if I have forgotten the password because they will send it to the Comcast account that I can't access. I have stayed with this company due to the inconvenience of having to transfer my email address. Well, I might as well switch companies now that I have to set up all new account with every company I do business with online. It is extremely frustrating that I cannot access bills, accounts and emails. Lengthy amount of time trying to find and transfer email address when you no longer have access to the email account that you have used for years due to the fact that Comcast lost my address in cyberspace and cannot correct the issue. I think everyone should switch companies because Comcast personnel are not knowledgeable about their services or helpful to consumers."
"Aimee of Forked River, NJ",5/5/2010,,"I have had Comcast for internet and cable since September 2008. I have been on time with every payment. It started with the first bill. There were 2 lines in the house already when we moved in. One line had to be installed or hooked up. We have been charged an additional $8.95 a month since then for this additional line. When I called and asked why and for how long, I was told forever, because it was an additional installation. Then one of the HD DVRs broke. They came and switched it out with a new one, and we're charged $20. I called and asked why when we are renting their equipment that I have to pay. It is their equipment that was faulty. They apologized, and I'm issued a credit and told if I purchase a service warranty for $20 a month, anything will be covered. I balked at this amount, and it's dropped to $3.99 a month.Then the modem started acting up. This happened about once a week. I called and was told to disconnect the cable and power for 15 seconds to reset it. I continue to do this for another year. I called whenever it didn't come right back and got told there's an outage or some reason. Finally, on one of the calls, I was told on their end that they can tell the modem is fried and schedule a tech to come and replace it. Tech came. It's replaced and worked OK for about 2 weeks, then it happened again. I called again and finally got someone who knows what they're doing. I was told it was not the modem and that from what he could tell in all the notes, it was the line. So he scheduled another tech to come and fix the hookup (that I was being charged the extra $8.95 a month for, no less). Since then, there's no problem with the internet.Now an issue with the replaced HD DVR. Descriptions in the guide do not show up, and the On Demand menu does not appear. I called, and they scheduled someone to come with a replacement. I waited, and no one came; so I called. I was told the dispatch was canceled on their end, because my account is past due (by 10 days) but that I can take the box in person and switch it out at one of the offices. I have waited to pay this bill until services were fixed, because I am tired of all the problems and am waiting to see if there aren't too many trees so I can have DirecTV instead. I vented to the CSR and said I at least would have appreciated notice that it was canceled. She issued me a credit.I have had ongoing problems with Comcast since the start. They overcharge for everything, nickel and dime everything, and have awful customer service. I pray to be able to switch to satellite!"
"Rosemarie of Aurora, CO",5/6/2010,,"My neighbors called for cable service and Comcast showed up, dug 2 holes in my yard and when they finished they left a wire cable across my yard. I called and asked why they ruined my grass and left the cable across my lawn in the open. They said I would have to wait a week so they send someone to bury it. They could have run the cables across the house gutters like everyone elseâ€™s cable. It is a sloppy job and an eye sore in front of my home. My gardener will not be able to cut my grass because it is laid out across my yard! I am very upset at the disrespect to otherâ€™s property. They could have sent someone to bury the same day or rescheduled until they had someone to do the job right!"
"Judy of Monterey, CA",5/7/2010,,"I wanted to disconnect my cable service with Comcast and found Comcast made it difficult for you to do so. Comcast wanted customers to return the ""digital TV equipments"" before the service can be canceled. Your email and phone calls don't count. To begin with, the equipment (a TV box) was not requested by customers but forced onto customers by Comcast. Comcast warned the customers they had to use the box. Otherwise, there wouldn't be any TV signals. Now coming to the time you want to discontinue the service, Comcast wants you: (1) drop off the equipment at its service center which can be a long drive from your home, (2) mail the equipment in and you pay for the shipping cost and (3) Comcast picks up the equipment and charges you $10.99 for pick-up. After being over-charged by Comcast for months or years, you cannot escape from them unless you let them rip you off again. It doesn't make much business sense that the customer has to pay for something that he doesn't ask for in the first place. And the business has the final say if it will discontinue its service. We are not living under a Comcast dictatorship. We should have the freedom to decide when to stop doing business with it. It shows that Comcast is doing everything to rip off its customers."
"Angela of Toms river, nj",5/9/2010,,"First off, their attitude stinks when you call, they treat you like you're a moron.  Next, they send out idiots to fix the problem; nobody knows what they are doing.  They have music in their ears while working, or on cell phones making personal calls.  Then, they have cables that need upgrading and won't fix them, the TV has been scrambling, distorted sound, off and on pictures, broken up scenes, etc.  This has been going on for years, yet the price keeps going up.  Adelphia was better while this company is money hungry."
"Jonell of Indianapolis, in",5/11/2010,,"I did not receive notification that service was changing to digital in Indianapolis. I have not had any cable service for two weeks. I ordered the boxes and was told that they were easy to install. We spent an entire weekend trying to make these digital boxes work for our televisions. We had to visit the local store. We had to have a filter removed that Comcast had evidently placed on an outside line years ago. We made eight calls to Comcast on the telephone tree waiting endlessly and being transferred. One call was 86 minutes and 57 seconds on hold! We still do not have cable service.We were promised an 'emergency visit' yesterday and no one called or came to the house. We had to have someone waiting for that visit all day and no one even called to say that Comcast was not coming. Today, we had a scheduled visit at 3-5pm. It is now 4:45 and no one is here. I am so frustrated at this incredibly poor customer service. I feel like little David going up a giant, Comcast the corporate giant. Your recording keeps telling us that Rick from customer service wants us to have an exceptional customer service. That is so far from the truth. We have been loyal to Comcast for 25 years and spent over a thousand dollars each year for our service. I could not be more upset and disappointed with your company. Comcast has given us the worst customer service we have ever had in our lives! "
"Robert of Port Norris, NJ",5/11/2010,,"I went to sleep this morning around 1:00 am to my favorite TV channel, only to wake up at 5:00 am and that very channel was nothing but ""snow.""  Since 2007, I have watched as Comcast has been consistently taking away cable services that I am paying for.  They never inform the customer that they are going to be taking away our channels.  We just wake up one day and they are gone.  I used to have many channels to watch and now, my family and I are reduced to around 13 channels.The only notices I have ever received from Comcast regarding their changes is their change in rates.  They love to make us pay more and give us substantially less.  I feel that this is unfair to all customers (including myself) who have service from Comcast that cannot afford anything else for their family to entertain themselves with.  I won't be the least bit surprised if one day, I fall asleep watching TV and I wake up and not having one channel to view while still paying for their services!  I feel that this is unfair business practices."
"Paul of Brooklyn Park, MN",5/12/2010,,"We need to do something about Comcast. They just started pushing a scrolling marque across the top of the TV for anyone on basic cable who doesn't currently use one of their cable boxes. It stays there across the top of the screen and just repeats endlessly. The message says, ""If you can see this message, the TV you're watching isn't yet ready for Comcast's digital network enhancements. To order the necessary equipment, call 1-877-634-4434 or go to www.comcast.com/digitalnow to avoid service interruptions. Once you have digital equipment connected to your TV you will no longer see this message.""I obviously don't appreciate Comcast's heavy handed approach at forcing people to use their cable boxes. What I really don't appreciate, however, is Comcast's back door attempt at trying to get people to subscribe to their ""digital"" offerings so they can soak consumers for more money. This is extortion pure and simple. Consumers are being forced to pay for new ""features"" that they are not requesting."
"Joe of Napa, CA",5/13/2010,,"I made an appointment with Comcast to set up a bundle pack. I asked the operator if I needed a TV during installation and she said no. When the tech arrived, he said that I did and that he couldn't do it without one. I own a second house 15 minutes away and asked him to wait in his truck while I run and get it and he said no, then walked out! I called back to make a new appointment and they said to go get my TV and that a supervisor would contact me back in 30 minutes.After waiting an hour, I called back and they said I would get a call in 30 minutes. After waiting another hour I called again and they said that the original tech would call me in 15 minutes. I told them that I did not want this tech as he was very rude to me the first time and just left without offering me any help nor did he attempt to make a new appointment with me and they said that a new tech would contact me.After waiting almost two hours I called again to cancel the whole thing. I then switched to AT&T who gave me a great package deal as well as a $50 gift card to say that they were sorry because Comcast was such a let down."
"David of Nashua, NH",5/14/2010,,"I keep loosing signal on these Xfinity boxes I was told I had to get. When I called for help, I keep getting disconnected on the phone. This is a breach of contract on their part and I am tired of it."
"Jean of Aurora, CO",5/15/2010,,"Over past 1-2 months, internet connectivity is extremely slow in the evening, some times unable to have websites load completely. In the morning, it is not a problem. "
"Kimberly of Conshohocken, PA",5/17/2010,,"Well where to start, I have had many problems over the past couple years more recent the past year. I have continually had problems with my boxes working and with on demand. I eventually gave up for a while due to the fact that I could not tolerate being treated so poorly and not getting the service that I am expected to pay for. Most recently on Saturday May 15, 2010 I went to a Comcast office because my HD box was not working getting on demand and one of my other boxes just stopped working completely a few days prior. So I get to the Comcast office and there is a door to slide the boxes in (thick glass) and the 1st thing that happened was the lady yelled at me for putting them in the wrong way? I mean like I was a child, the customer next to me felt the need to get involved and said maybe you should have a sign on how to put them in if there is a certain way to do so.Then when I told her I only need to exchange them for not working, she proceeded to tell me that the number on my HD box did not match up. I told her that is the only one we had and about 7 months (or so) ago one of the cable guys tried to exchange it that was the only time it would have been switched to fix the problem. She said well he shouldnâ€™t have done that and that now I would have to pay an extra $9.95 per month for the extra box. I proceeded to tell her that it is not an extra box, we only had the one HD box and I did not want to pay $9.95 for a box that one of the employees made a mistake on. She said until that other one is turned in I would have to do exactly that. She refused to try and help in any way just belittling me. I told her to give me the box because we needed it and that I would call the 800 number. She said they wonâ€™t do anything ( as she was mumbling things about hating dealing with this) She finally gave me the box (charging me of course)and then asked me if I had the slip from 6-8 months ago from when he came out to my house .. I told her that I wouldnâ€™t have saved something from that long ago -- she proceeded to tell me she saves everything for 7 years, I told her she is a better person than me then! She said I didnâ€™t mean that then; she was just so nasty to me. So I left and called the 800 number and spoke to a gentleman who was very nice, he took care of the box and corrected the numbers on my account for me and then we found out that another problem with my account was as follows: When everything switched to digital we were sent a notice that said we needed a box for every TV. I called the 800 number and they told me that I could get 2 boxes at no charge for 1 year. Then normal charges would apply. Come to find out they have been charging me $8.90 per month for every box since July. I told him why I would go from paying nothing extra for the TVs which are in bedrooms to $8.90 per month each. He said it looks like they shipped out the wrong boxes; he could only go back and give me a credit for 2 months (about $36.00) but that is not fair to me. I am not an employee and how I am supposed to know they sent the wrong boxes. I mean they were mailed and I have to assume that they were correct. I have to be honest I never review the bill in detail because I donâ€™t really understand it. To make the matter worse when I got home and hooked up the boxes the HD box did not work and now I have to go again and return it. I work almost 60 hours a week and when I m home I have family obligations of taking kids to sporting events and other things. I was told by the lady in the Comcast office that it must not be that important of I canâ€™t arrange my schedule to have someone come out to the house? Many in todayâ€™s day and age she has the time, but I am never nor can I be home for 4 hours at a time to wait for the cable company to come out. She said what about Sundays --- I told her no not then either. I mean she is now questioning my schedule. Bottom line ~ I want my bill and cable fixed!"
"Peggy of Boalsburg, PA",5/19/2010,,"I have had difficulties with my internet for over a year. Comcast had laid new lines and since then, I've been constantly being dropped from the internet. I thought my problems were within my own home since my computer is old. Someone told me to call Comcast to see if the problems were external. I have been calling since March 2010 and have records of each call. They confirmed that the problem is outside and have repeatedly told me that they would have maintenance come out and boost the signal. To date, this still has not been resolved. I need help. I am constantly being disconnected. I am so frustrated with their poor service and promises of resolving this issue and not doing so. I am unemployed and have been for some time. My internet access is critical in my job search. I am not seeking employment outside of my area and this service is my only way of checking and applying for employment outside of my vicinity."
"Joseph of Newton, MA",5/20/2010,,"I am writing to complain about a general problem. It is 7am and half the channels available to me are ""paid programming!"" I am paying a basic cable rate of 63 dollars for Comcast to make profits by removing real programming and put on shill advertising, much of which the producers of usually get convicted of fraud and larceny (See Kevin **). Why are they allowed to do this? They are charging us to selling us programming they are in return paid to air.There either has to be a reduction in rates equal to the amount they take in in paid programming or this programming must stop. In the worst economic crisis in the last 30 years, Comcast's profits were up nearly a billion dollars in late 2009. I do not begrudge a company making a profit but isn't this supposed to be similar to a public utility company. That's why we let them wire up the cities. The old Mayor of my hometown warned of this type of rampant abuse of the public trust, when cable first came to the City."
"Gregory of Nashville, TN",5/21/2010,,"In mid March, I obtained service from Comcast for internet services only. The installer gave me the wrong information, about what kind of modem I needed to use DOCSIS3 speeds, and the modem models on their website, and with customer service also gave the wrong information. A ""clerical"" error kept me at the lower rate, so I wasn't losing too much in bandwidth. When my April/May bill came out, the floods came to Nashville. I called the auto information line, and it said there was an outage in our area. The only thing is all the other families in my building with Comcast had no outage for the 6 days I experienced one.Two techs were sent out, who fixed my DOCSIS3 modem issue, and made sure I was on the proper billing tier, took about 2 hours to fiddle with their box on the well to get my connection up to snuff, as best as they could. Because some flood issues further upstream, were causing minor radio noise on the lines. Okay, I can accept that it will be fixed, as things get back to normal. But these techs blew out 4 other families' cable connections in the building, while ""fixing"" mine. Now, it took me 6 days to get assistance.Somehow, these 4 families got a tech out the next day, to fix their cable/internet and degraded my line to the point that, by 1.5 days later, their internet analyst, Ana, did something on her end, and I lost all connection. Until then, just my download speeds were being affected, and not my upload. I did a back trace route, and reported the server that was between my house and modem, was not responding. There was nothing, just hours and hours of aggravation. I was told that it would be 3 days before a tech could come out. I understand, that in normal circumstances, their SLAS are 24 hours or less. They refused to respond.The tech did not show up on Tuesday or Wednesday, but I found a call tag on my door, after I just got home from dropping off their modem to a ""counter location"". The address in the phone books is some locked down secretary spot. She stated people always come here. I said it's the address in the phone book for all local Comcast listings. She gave me a ""map"", of how to get to a counter location. I paid these jokers $250 for a tech who didn't do the install correctly at $40. I was out for 10 days with no service. They ""refunded"" my first set of outage days. I'm awaiting my bill for the second. The headaches from using their ""internet"" service, and talking with an analyst, only to be ""hung up on"", after being told ""you need to call this"" and  ""I can't help you"". I got their ""advertised"" speeds on their network, try speedtest.comcast.net, but not on the internet, because of latency/resistance. Try just speedtest.net. This is how the ""claim"" of speeds is determined. So the first speed test is only on their network. The second is the true internet. They totally have a sweet monopoly in this town. No other cable companies are allowed. However, out of this metropolitan area, they have competition. I've lost time, and gotten half baked results. I was charged for things that I did not get service on. It was a total waste."
"Kennedy of Lake Forest, IL",5/22/2010,,"When paying my bill of $162.24 online, Comcast took $580 from my bank account. They will not refund the excess. I'll have possible Bank NSF's on bills and loan payments."
"Thomas of Bloomfield, NJ",5/22/2010,,Now any discounts we get will be in vain because I will have to take time off work and lose out on pay so I can meet a tech at the house to then be charged for a service call.
"Yolanda of Houston, TX",5/22/2010,,"After having to reschedule several times within two weeks because techs failed to show up and customer service hung up on me, I refused the free movies option that the supervisor recommended and asked for a free month of service. I was granted the free month of service but then they retaliated by slowing down my internet, phone and cable services. Not only was I late for interviews, but this delayed my job search while waiting for techs. More importantly, that same week, my computer contracted a vicious Trojan virus entered my computer and damaged it completely. I never had viruses on my computer before this. I always had it very well protected. Itâ€™s just too coincidental. Now all I get is a box saying ""Access Violation to Module (numbers)"" with another box saying something about ending Comcast AntiSpy something. I never had a problem with my computer until I dealt with Comcast. Now I have no computer to go job hunting. "
"Nayeem of Somerset, NJ",5/22/2010,,"I am a professional photographer. I usually have to download and upload photos for clients in a timely manner. For past 2 to 3 months, I have been having internet connection issue. My internet gets disconnected; therefore, my business phone gets disconnected since it is running over the internet (Vonage). The tech from Comcast came to my place and tried to troubleshoot this issue. Every time they came, they reset the router and it worked but the next day I had same issue. Last week, one more tech came and I said that I have issue with my wireless router so he suggested to me to get router from Comcast which I did. I still have issue with my internet connection. Yesterday and today, I called again but still it's the same issue. I am paying for this service but it never works as expected. This issue has impacted my business greatly. I am not able to deliver photos to my client on time which is having a bad impression on my clients. Moreover, I am not able to answer customer calls since my phone is not working along with my internet. Since my phone does not work, I have to use my personal cell phone which is costing me money every time I call them and be on the line for at least 15 to 20 minutes. "
"Randy of Atlanta, GA",5/24/2010,,"I have been dealing with Comcast for about 6 months now on getting charges removed from my bill. I cancelled their home phone service and showtime service in December. I continued to get billed for it. In addition to these charges, since I did not pay the bill, I got charged with late fees and reconnect fees. In one instance, they had credited back some money to me and in the same bill charged me these fees. I told the rep that it seemed like a slap in the face for them to admit wrong in the same statement that they charged the fees. She credited half. In another call, I spoke to someone about getting the last fees removed of $12 and it was a very pleasant call, one where she understood why the fees needed to be credited. I just received my last bill and apparently the bogus reactivation fees are on there still. I made another call and the operator advised me that the credit request was placed, but that my service was due to be interrupted again! Comcast service is included with my rent outside of a DVR and internet modem charge. I'm not sure how they get away with treating a member of such a large account this way but they do. Please contact them and tell them to stop taking advantage of consumers and to get their billing practices on the right track."
"Anita of San Mateo, CA",5/26/2010,,"I called Tech support to make sure their website was compatible with my Mac 10.3.9 & was told by Mellisa that indeed it was. So it was installed last Friday. 2 hrs. later, I could not get to their email site as I got error message that I needed 10.4 to continue. I cannot update my computer; so now, I can't send emails. They had to replace the modem as I was not getting any internet nor mail. Now they've threatened to charge me 2 visits. As a new customer, they quoted me $101.77 which after it was installed, I paid $171.26 & I was to get credit for the over charges. Well, today it yet went up again, to $129.76 & that it will now be $171.26 the following month?! They hung up on me."
"Shawn of Boca Raton, FL",5/26/2010,,"Now, I had 2 different technicians come out to fix my cable and internet. Both failed and left before the problem was resolved. I donâ€™t mind paying $120 a month for cable service but if they canâ€™t fix problems that they cause, itâ€™s not worth the money. Iâ€™m considering canceling and taking the business elsewhere."
"Tammy of Spring , TX",5/26/2010,,"I've been with Comcast since the switch a few years ago. I thought Time Warner was bad about things like accounting methods, repair services and CSRs who clearly have no idea what they are doing - whether you get them on the phone or have the misfortune to have them come to your home. A few weeks ago, contractors fixing my neighbor's fence sliced through the cable line, disconnecting all my services. I called the customer service line, told them the problem and the guy told me he was going to ""expedite"" the order because I had no services whatsoever at that time. Three days went by and no Comcast, so I called back and they told me they have no record of me calling at all. As to the reference number I was given, the operator told me there is always a six digit number and I only had four. The real kicker, when I asked for another reference number in case the same thing happens again, she gave me a five digit number!When I called her on it, she said that was the number coming up on her screen, so that was the one I should use if I had to call back. The next day, they finally made it to my house to fix the problem, which they did, only the tech didn't rebury the lines and told me I would have to call Comcast and have them send another tech guy to do this, that he wasn't responsible for doing this. I just don't understand how these people get away with running a company this way. If I ran my business this way, I wouldn't have one! Oh and I forgot, apparently according to their accounting methods, me being without my services for four days total was only worth twenty dollars and considering I pay $150.00 for the bundle package, I think their math leaves much to be desired!"
"Judy of Danville, NH",5/26/2010,,"Today, I lost my phone service and internet access for 12 hours. I live in the woods and my cell has no bars. I am 63 and need this service I pay for. Every time I get a bill, the price goes up and the service goes down. This has happened 3 times this month."
"Lynn of Elkhart, IN",5/28/2010,,"When I see online complaints about companies, I am sometimes suspicious the complaints have been posted by competitors. So for the record, I'd like to state that I am in no way connected with the ISP world. I'm just a frustrated internet user who is paying Comcast for the purported reliability of 24/7 ISP/phone service, but am plagued with extended service interruptions. We are located between **.During the last 2 weeks, our Comcast internet and telephone service has 6 times gone out for 1-3 hours, usually in the early morning, 4-7 am period. Our cable TV service is not interrupted. When this happens, we call Comcast and they verify that the modem is off line. They sent out a service technician who replaced our modem but that did not resolve the problem. Reportedly, Comcast has scheduled a line service check (to take place sometime in the next 10-14 days!). They have issued a whopping $6 refund, to compensate us for approximately 20 hours accumulated service outages. To appreciate our frustration you should be aware that this is not an isolated instance. A similar spate of service interruptions took place about 6 months ago and about 6 months before that and about 6 months before that.When this happened a year ago, Comcast reran the line from the pole to our house. When it happened 6 months ago, the line-check rep found a cable box at the pole on our neighbor's property, that had been improperly reassembled and was filled with water. When it happened 18 months ago, the line-check rep said lines in our area are old, run through water pockets and need to be rerun. That ""jives"" with our observation that most service interruptions take place when it's raining or morning dew is heavy. We rarely have an outage on a bright sunny day.Ours is not a large residential area. The number of people effected might be few, but maybe not. If you're experiencing Comcast ISP outages in the **, weigh in here, maybe if enough of us complain, Comcast will fix it."
"Judy of Danville, NH",5/28/2010,,"Two days in a row at the same time (10:30 am), my phone service went out and came back on 8 pm at night. The second time it happened I had to drive up the road to call on my cell phone. A technician came and said that my cable was loose. Funny it happened at the same time. Today I had the TV show scrambled for 15 minutes off and on. Just now I was watching a show and another showâ€™s voice was on. Sometimes the voice just does not come on or it freezes up. The consequence: stress."
"Mmk of Houston, tx",5/28/2010,,"I have attempted for three days now to contact Comcast regarding continual issues with accessing my email through their service. I keep getting a server issue error message. I have been unable to contact them via internet or telephone. The automated message keeps telling me they are experiencing ""higher than normal"" call volumes. Perhaps this means others are having the same problem. I am ready to drop the service as I have had ongoing unresolved issues with digital cable as well. I feel like I am throwing my money away!"
"Kent of Brunswick, GA",5/30/2010,,"Poor quality. Inability to provide service paid for. Difficult to communicate problems through voicemail ""Hell"" 800 numbers. They asked us to take off work to get service a week later. Unable to meet consumers basic needs for service paid for. Lost entertainment time paid for. Lost time and effort trying to get problems corrected. Lost competition for services due to monopoly standard."
"Lj of Farmington, NM",6/2/2010,,"Seriously? I've been a customer for 15+ years. I've been through so many DVRs (refurbished, my butt). Called, emailed, went to local office, they always have some problem, specifically not working. Yet they still charge me month after month. Discounts for crappy service? Nope. Going to DirectTV."
"Thomas of Anderson, IN",6/5/2010,,"Internet, cable and phone service has been intermittent or down since our original installation date in late December, 2009. We have placed several calls to customer service and they have reset the modem each time, checked signal strength, and did various forms of diagnostic tests which temporarily fix problems. On May 15, 2010, after not having phone or internet service for over a week, we finally were able to call customer service. They were to send a technician on May 16, 2010, or at latest, May 19, 2010. No one showed either day.Again, we called customer service and a technician was sent on 5/25/10. The technician walked in to the apartment stood 5 feet from the cable box and flashed his flashlight. He refused to listen to what issues were had, refused to call a manager, and he was asked to leave since he was let in the home to fix a problem and did nothing. We spoke to a manager on 5/26/10, who stated that he would send another technician to diagnose the problem and would call us back after the diagnosis to discuss crediting our account. On 6/2/10, that same technician came out (even though we were told he wouldn't be sent), but this time he replaced all the wiring and connections in the apartment. He told us that the building was known to have intermittent service, known because a fellow employee lives in the same building and advised him of such. All he said we could do was continue to call when our service is down since the connection and service problem is not on our end but on the provider's end. The manager has yet to call us to discuss crediting our account.On 6/5/10, out internet was down 4 times in 2 hours, the modem was reset again and we spent an hour on the phone without accomplishing anything, and even during that conversation the internet went down again. Our repeated requests to speak with a manager were denied / ignored, and we have yet another technician coming out on 6/9/10. We have been given reference number CR205503434 and CR207887591. We were offered a onetime $50 credit for 5 months of limited service, missed appointments (as ""promised"" on the Comcast commercials, they credit the account for missed appointments), and we will still have the same issues of limited or no service in the future. I do not believe that this is a fair compensation. There is no other cable or internet service provider in our area and we are forced to have their service or we would go elsewhere. We purchased cell phones since we did not have dependable home phone service. While this isn't a big deal, we would like to actually get the service we pay for."
"Gary of San jose, ca",6/5/2010,,"For the year, I had them, they gave me the run around about $99/month billing. My contract shows $90/month in two different places. Now that I am cancelled (can one ever get away from those people? ), as of Sept. 2009 (I went to Taiwan), they continue to bill me! (While in the lobby, I observed three different people there for no other business than to ask, ""Why, when I cancelled service, are you still charging me?"") I return in March 2010 and called to ask the same thing to which I was assured things would be taken care of. I came back June of this year to find my bill has gone to collections and they are threatening to go to the three credit reporting agencies! Did I mention, while I was gone I had some people from South Korea staying at my house and Comcast came by and managed to get $124 out of them? So, now I am back and I wish I could charge them for all the time I am spending on this most not American of dealings! I am given a confirmation number for a time that they will call (it has been ""escalated""), and I need to be by the phone from Wed. to Fri. in the morning hours. The time came and went to no avail!When I called back, they were all apologetic, but happy to set me up with another conformation number for a call back. No thank you! Oh, by the way, and this is a dozy, honest! My neighbor across the street, they had them for 1 and 1/2 months, deciding to cancel. It was easier pulling out your wisdom teeth with a pair of pliers without Novocaine! The bill reached above $700, so my neighbor made a deal. They said, ""split the cost, you walk away, and never bother us again!"" Comcast accepted this! And now my neighbors do not even want to enter into a class action law suit, should I be able to wrangle one! But, my neighbors stated, if Comcast comes around offering their services for 10 years, and for free, they still would not accept!They are, by far, the most maddening, irresponsible, inept, clingy, blind, deaf and dumb, ungracious, do nothing, clumsy, muddle headed, two faced, idiotic, right hand not knowing what its left hand is doing company, that has ever spawned a desire to succeed, on the face of the planet, that I have ever had the misfortune of doing business with! What makes them think that, once you enter into a contract with them, that they own you for life? I will report them and I will sue them for all of my time! I will do my best effort to make them blink! How dare they! They are without shame! PS. I do not think they have anybody in this area code any more. That is, now that I have quit them! $124.00 and the threats of it being reported to the credit card reporting agencies! Time and distraction."
"Robert of Northville, MI",6/6/2010,,"Comcast said they'd arrive between 2-5 on a Sunday. They didn't. I called at 5. I waited on hold for 25 minutes. They rep said a technician would be calling me in 15 minutes or less. They didn't. I called back at 6. I waited another 15 minutes. The rep said the same thing - which a tech would call soon. They didn't. It gets worse. I asked for an adjustment to my service. The first time I asked - I asked via the chat site. After many questions - the person told me they weren't ""authorized"" to make billing changes. (It would have been handy had something said that right up front.) When I asked the rep on the phone to make an adjustment, he told me he couldn't (after saying he could), because it might require adjusting one of my services (phone). This company is clearly run by morons."
"John of Houston, TX",6/8/2010,,"Comcast is taking channels away from their basic service then trying to get you to pay $7-$8 per month to get them back via cable set box rental. They claim they can change their channel line up at any time so you are stuck. They have taken away 8 high definition channels and three other channels for a total of 11 channels, you have no recourse except go to Rabbit ears to get your Hi-Def Local channels or go to satellite service. I think that our apartment building should receive the $7-$8 per month per unit back as they decreased our service in that amount. Maybe some attorney out there would like to file a class action against these deceptive business practices."
"Nelida of Detroit, MI",6/8/2010,,"I have been a Comcast customer for many years. Lately, I am very unhappy with their service. I happen to be one of the unfortunate people that don't have a credit card or a bank account. Comcast acts like it is a crime. My bill is due on the first of the month and I always pay it when I say that I am going to pay it, but Comcast is very uncooperative with there customers. They act like you are stupid. Because they tell you things like they cannot manually access your account. But as soon as they get there money the service is activated, how is that if they cannot access anything. I even had someone tell me once to hang up call back maybe I will have better luck with someone else. That is the kind of people Comcast has working for them. Maybe I should sue them for false advertising.On TV they talk big about how they can resolve any problem and that they are available to you 24/7 but that is a lie. When ever you call there is always a problem and all you get sometimes is a recording what ever happened to talking issues out with a real person. The reason I stay with Comcast is because they are the only company that offers triple play service in my area which is Detroit Mi. At and t is working on bringing there service to my area soon when they do it is going to be good by Comcast. Comcast needs to revise there service big time if they don't want to keep loosing customers. I work for the state and get paid the 2nd Thursday of every month which usually falls the week after my bill is due but I always get my service cut and then when I pay the bill I get charged all these turn on fees if they would work with me it would not happen. I think it is very unfair. Comcast your service in Detroit, MI is bad big time."
"Shelby of Powder Springs, GA",6/8/2010,,"When I signed up for Comcast, I was told the total first bill would be $79 and some change for TV, Internet, and installation charges (as well as fees and taxes). My first bill arrived, and it was $236.28. I immediately called Comcast and I ran through the list of charges on my bill. The CSR saw there were errors and informed me that she had removed them and that I would see another bill. I never received another bill, but I logged onto Comcast, and I saw that another erroneous charge still remained.I tried calling Comcast, and the call never connected (it would ring once, Comcast would answer, and then there was silence). I decided to hop on the Live Chat for answers. I waited 30 minutes. When someone finally came, they couldn't tell me anything. I was staring right at my screen showing what my bill is, and they were telling me it was something different. When I questioned the fee on my bill, they told me that was discounted $20, which it wasn't. The HSI Standard Install fee was $49.95; however, we didn't get HSI (High Speed Internet) so they deducted $20 and made it the $29.95 Internet install fee. I questioned what the fee in question was and I was told, ""It's for reconnecting your cable"".  I told them it was a brand new account! They told me, ""let me check,"" and then I was on hold (online!) for another 15 minutes. He informed me of a different amount than what shows on my bill was for installing service at my home (even though I was given a different amount. ) I still could not get through Comcast's customer service via the telephone. Moral of the story: don't believe Comcast when they tell you (exactly) how much an install will be. Always plan for the amount to be paid to be at least double. "
"Ken of Riverview, MI",6/8/2010,,"We returned our cable boxes back on May 5, 2010 and cancelled our service. We signed up with WOW. Comcast is still billing us and we have spent hours on the phone with their customer service, who promise that it will be corrected. It has not been corrected as of today 6/8/10--over a month. I can't stand this company and I am sick of talking to the slugnutty idiots in their customer service."
"Susie of Union City, CA",6/8/2010,,"On June 5, 2010, I was surprised with an increase of my bill from $66.00 bundle package to $104.94. Comcast did not notify me ahead of time for this increase. A month ago, when I went to pay for my bill at Comcast-Hayward, I asked a staff in that office for any promotions. The staff told me that he will give me 12 months of premium channel for $9.99 and continue the $66.00 bundle package for another 12 months. When I received my bill, I was surprised that my bill was for $164.99. When I called Comcast, I was subjected to talk to different representatives about it. Comcast refused to honor what this company originally offered me. After I hung up the phone, my internet service got disconnected and I had to make more calls to question my internet service. I spent my whole day trying to resolve the billing issues and technical difficulties that I continue to experience. Today, June 7, 2010, I turned on my television set and I found that Comcast also disconnected my cable service. I had to call again to find out about my cable service. A technician by the name of Karen, had told me that someone disconnected my service. She has to turn on my service. I was on the phone waiting for half an hour to get a cable service again. It appears that Comcast had been playing with my services by someone turning it on and off.I've missed my 11:00pm show because I had to spend half an hour to get a technician on the line. Only to tell me that she is sorry, she will turn the cable service on. How can you get Comcast to do fair business practices? How can I stop Comcast staff to play with my cable and internet services. "
"Michael of South San Francisco, CA",6/8/2010,,"Comcast sent a technician out turning off service to various homes in my neighborhood without notice. They said they were cleaning out the cable system or adjusting there frequencyâ€™s power. In order to turn back on my service, they had to send a technician out to check my home system which was working fine. The technician said I had a bad splitter and switched it out. Remember, everything was working fine in my end until they decided to unplug me from the system. Example: you go get your oil check, which you know is fine, and the mechanic switches the oil, 4 to 8 quarts and filter--charging full boat. I have just been taken without notice or warning. Comcast charged me $27.99 plus $1.54 for the surcharges and fees. I am going to switch to a different provider."
"Connie of Keithville, LA",6/8/2010,,"Although their customer service number states that they are open 24/7, it's not.  I also tried at 11:30 AM today at their 800 number, and was told customer service was unavailable, and to try again. I've sent 2 emails about my erroneous and ever changing bills (not one in the past 15 months has been the same), but have never received a response to the emails. Last year, I spent months speaking to 7-9 different people to correct this matter. I never received a logical or adequate response, they just kept adjusting the bill. When I finally received customer service using their local number, they couldn't explain my bills for the past year and a half. They had to research and call me back (in my experience it won't happen). Furthermore, I was told that ""bundling"" service does not really exist, as my cable, phone, and internet all expired at different times, although all of them  were installed on same date. I was told that after 12 months, my bundle discount for all three services would go from $89 to $110. Now, I am told that each service is expiring on different months (although installed on same date), and that the basic rate for bundle of all three was never $109.99, is not now, and never was. Literature I have from your company indicates that after 12 months, the bundle of all three goes to $109.99 per month plus taxes and any extra channels ordered. I was told I never had the bundled package. Now, they want to do the same thing this year as last, and charge more than I contracted, or was promised. The bills are not decipherable. Not one is the same, so I cannot figure out what I'm receiving, or what's charged.  I've been chared for HD service from day one, although I never received the correct box. The installer gave the wrong box, and I  was unable to connect to the internet.  The installer said  he'd return the next day (didn't, and I set up myself). I was supposed to get HBO on demand, but I don't.  The screen says I have to pay for it, but my bill says I have been paying for it. I am paying for services I haven't been receiving.  On top of that, this year, as well as last year, you are increasing my bill again, without adequate explanation, and refuse to abide by your agreement and contract.  Now, you are advertising that basic bundled service after 12 months increases to $109.99, which your rep has denied.  I have your ads, and you are bound by them.  Bait and switch is illegal.  I have seen countless complaints in the internet for the same things. I've been a paralegal for 30 years.  I do not need your attorney (he represents you, and does not represent my interests).  He can call me if he wants, but how he can get you out of your contract and advertisement's promises (in print and commercials), I would love to hear."
"Gretchen of Bloomington, MN",6/9/2010,,It's the past due Billing and collections. They keep telling I owe them $140. I opened an account. I found out my roommate already had one. She downgraded due to travel and I didn't need. They billed me; I called said my roommate who has an account closed this one. They never did. I called several times. They left it open and still harass me. I kept calling telling them to close it!
"Paula of Knoxville, TN",6/9/2010,,"I am upset about company harassing me about a non-issue from the past. I have used Comcast for many years and all of my families as well. One of your employees gave me my prepaid monthly fee back because I was in good standing when I changed to another company. This change was due to losing a job. I had to cut back. This was in 2008. Later today, I rebutted this old charge (again) because my prepaid month was returned to me. That alone establishes that I was in good standing and I owed nothing monetarily. I was told Comcast would pick up the box. I was not working during that period. I was laid off. How can your company state that because Comcast stated they would pick it up, it is my fault? No, I did not make your employees pick up your box within a week. It is not my fault. This has been two years. I paid my bills or I would not have been refunded. I have requested Comcast to not harass me anymore. I have requested data from Knology to document when I started using Knology. P.B. There were no other applicable fees or charges. Documents will be provided to dictate and prove Knology start date at my home and how they scheduled appointments and did not show. I will make sure my family and friends know how they will be treated when they use Comcast. "
"Jennifer of Rockford, IL",6/9/2010,,"The on demand say error every time we try to get it on the TV. When I tried to call Comcast, each phone call was dropped. The only person I could reach on line was Moses and he said he couldn't help me. I asked him for another phone # I could call. Even that one dropped my call. Help! It's pretty bad to pay what we do for the Triple Play and can't watch the stations we want and can't even call to find out what is wrong! "
"Matt of Rye, NH",6/11/2010,,"After having nothing but bad experiences with Comcast Cable, I decided to switch service for awhile and try something else. We had horrible DVR service with them and also had to jump through hoops when moving 8 miles! When calling up, the lady was initially somewhat nice. I informed her that I wanted to cancel my cable but I did want to stay a customer and keep my internet service. I knew the price would go up as I was under a discount which was fine.After realizing that I would not take any offers to keep their cable, the lady informed me that the price to just have internet would be $59.95, which was not what I had been told or what the website said either. When I told her that the retail price listed on the website was $44.95 and I had no issues paying that, she got very rude and informed me that the price I have to pay is the $59.95 and that's that and she's been there for 10 years and she knows. I then informed her that the terms of service on their site said nothing about a higher price nor this being a promotional price, there were only two prices listed that of a promotional for new customers and the retail price. I then asked to speak with her supervisor, which she fought and became very rude. I just kept asking to speak with her supervisor and saying â€œthank youâ€ until she finally went and got him.The supervisor was initially very nice and listened to my complaint. I told him that I just wanted to pay retail pricing and I'm not asking for any discounts. I just don't want to be charged a ""punishment fee"" for not keeping their cable. I was told that they can charge whatever they want because the terms of service state you should call Comcast for pricing and service listing. The answers from both the initial rep and the supervisor changed constantly, they were clearly grasping for anything to justify their price. I was told first that it was a regional price and I was on their countrywide site, when I informed them that I put in my zip code and even a few addresses to get pricing they said that the prices I see were promotional. This then changed when I said that ""no, promotional is also listed and this is listed as the regular retail price"", then I got the response that that is not the real retail price. They could not produce the price they were going to charge me on any documents, I was told it would be on my bill and that's the only way I could see it.I believe this is completely wrong and the worst customer care out there. Never have I been talked to and treated so horribly. All I wanted was to pay retail and instead was getting cheated and given some mysterious price. I hate to think of how many others are getting robbed by these prices that they choose and you have no way to fight. I was told there was nothing they could do and when I asked to speak with a manager, I was told he couldn't do anything either that their hands were tied. I informed them that I would look for another provider and cancel all my services as soon as I could. It was like I was being robbed over the phone and nobody cared. This is a horrible for a company who claims to be trying to increase customer service ratings."
"Zosima-Susie of Union City, CA",6/12/2010,,"Comcast deceived me with their promo product packages. This company do not honor what they offer. This is deception. Comcast just increased my bill with not warning or notices at all. When I called them up to complain about the promotion offered to me, Comcast told me that I cannot get into any promotion anymore, that I have to pay $164.99 as per my bill. I downgraded my service on June 5, 2010 because I refused to pay Comcast anymore money. Now when the downgrade happened in June 5, 2010, I've been having problem with my cable service and my internet service. At night like 11:00PM, when I would turn on my TV to watch the news, I would find no service.When I take my online classes, my internet service would get turned off. Do you see what happens if Comcast cannot suck anymore money from you? The staff would play with my cable/internet services. All what I can do is to devote my time to call a technician and they would relate to you their bible studies of reasons why I do not have cable/internet services. Comcast deceives you and makes fun of your services if they cannot suck any more money from you. Is there a law to prohibit from this kind of business practice? Please help. Thanks."
"Nellie of Silver Spring, MD",6/12/2010,,"After several months of having incorrect bills, as well as invalid charges, poor service and inability to have representatives reconcile account, I made my most recent attempt today, June 12, 2010 to correct bill and zero out account. I would cancel the service, but need it and there are few other comparable services to switch to and they cost fees to transfer, new installation, as well as have this balance remain. My account had been placed in a past due status and was suspended. But the only bill needing to be paid is my current bill due 6-6-10, that I am trying to rectify so I can make the payment (for the valid bill amount). Because of the suspension, I was repeatedly routed (after a several minute long automated answering service) to the payment department, which is not equipped to handle and reconcile accounts (they can only take payments, nor can they transfer to a department that can assist customers). Supervisors are not able to assist either. I was hung up on 3 times. I became more irate, as I had to go through this process, and have wasted 3 hours on my Saturday and still have not been able to resolve the issue. There are bogus ""trip fees"", misc. installation charges and additional fees applied to my account without my knowledge or consent. These charges comprise the ""outstanding balance"" on my account, and I refuse to make those payments as they are invalid. I am concerned that Comcast will continue to accrue charges, report to my credit and continue to harass me over this amount. I cannot continue to deal with them, they have horrible service, incompetent staff and continue to make bogus charges, alter bills, and even delete bills. Online account management shows differently than the paper bills. It is a complete mess. I am waging a formal complain, for all of these issues, I am a single parent who has to take several hours away from her children on the weekend, the only time she has to share with them, to discuss this bill over and over, without full resolution and become agitated and I am extremely disappointed with the company as a whole. I am appalled by the lack of service orientation and the inability to actually assist their customers. The amount of time I have had to call, web chat and email with Comcast is ridiculous. I should be reimbursed for all the time spent on this matter. I would never recommend this service to another customer. The waste of time just to get to a representative through the automated service is enough to complain about. Extreme emotional distress form myself, and affects my children by decreasing quality time on the weekend and the bad attitude I am in, as a result of dealing with this company."
"Maurice of Port Charlotte, FL",6/14/2010,,"A salesman offered me a great triple play deal. Installation was marred by requiring 3 visits with 3 no shows. There were hidden costs not revealed by sales person. Despite many calls to customer service, they would not give the Internet service that was promised. I have an extremely slow internet connection."
"Stephanie of North Port, FL",6/15/2010,,"After 3 years of loyalty and 7 months of trying to get special pricing to lower my bill I had decided to leave Comcast as I got a much better deal with a satellite TV company. I called Comcast to advise them I needed my service turned off. They advised me I would have a $29.95 fee to send a tech to put a filter on my line. I asked to speak to a manager, who informed me, the same. I asked where it is stated they will charge this if you cancel. I was advised that it is not in writing but is available on some channel on their cable station. I think this is terrible service. I will never use them again. I will be writing to the company- but also posting all over the social network sites. I am so appalled."
"Jennifer of Dallastown, PA",6/16/2010,,"I have never had such a horrible experience dealing with a company as I did dealing with Comcast! I spent over 4 days calling and emailing people with my complaints and in the end, I only ended up more frustrated than ever. I have had Comcast service for 5 years after moving back to the area. My boyfriend and I recently purchased a house, so I contacted Comcast to transfer my service from my old home to the new address. I went through all of the details and when I was about finished, I was told that there was a do not service flag on our new address. They wanted us to come into their office and provide all types of documents showing that we were in fact the new owners of the home. I explained that we both worked crazy hours and that this was next to impossible. I then asked for a supervisor and was told that one wasn't in the office yet (Monday morning at 9am). I was told I would receive a call back from someone within 2 hours according to operator 92Z since you can't get a person's name anymore. I finally received a call from Michael 3 hours after the promised time. Michael was rude and completely ignorant and kept stating that there was nothing he could do. At this point, I am extremely frustrated so I go on Comcast.net and write an email venting my frustration. 2 days later, I receive a call from Sandy (supposedly from Corporate Comcast). The conversation went from bad to worse when all she called to tell me was that there was nothing she could do for me (I wasn't asking for money) I was looking for compensation such as a new offer for my inconvenience.When I threatened to leave Comcast and go with Dish Network she didn't even care! So my final words to Sandy were so basically you wasted 5 minutes of my work day to call me and tell me you can do nothing for me and her response was ""Yes, I did!"" I got off the phone and immediately called my boyfriend to inform him I was done with Comcast for good! He decided to see if he could handle things by actually going in to the York, PA office. When he went in the agent was rude. She let it slip that the charges from the previous owners was for equipment and the address should have never been flagged! So in other words, she basically came out and said they were in error.When asked what she could do to make the situation right for our inconvenience and time, she said nothing! When he asked why he shouldn't switch to Dish Network, she had the audacity to say, ""He probably should!"" This got him going and when he got home he called Comcast and demanded to speak with someone who could do something for him. He eventually reached a Manager in the Lebanon, PA Office who actually listened to our story and was appalled at what had happened. In the end, this manager offered us such a deal that we ended up staying with Comcast. So, when you need something done do not call Customer Service or Sandy at Corporate because they obviously have no power to do anything to keep their customers happy, but I do recommend you keep complaining because they can do something for you! Comcast is not a company that believes that their customers are always right!"
"Jennifer of Salt Lake City, UT",6/17/2010,,"I was first charged inaccurately to lease my own modem as if it were Comcast's modem. I told them repeatedly over about three years time that it was my own modem they were charging me for. Finally, I took the modem in to show them and the customer service rep agreed that it indeed was not Comcast's property and promised that she would speak with her manager when the manager returned in the morning to credit my account. She said she had noted the whole situation and that my credit ($100 +) would show up on my next bill. It didn't and I spoke to many people over the next several months trying to get the issue resolved. Six to eight months later, after having to take my modem back in for verification, at which time I canceled my high Speed internet service through them, I was finally credited about a month later. I only kept my basic cable service until a few months ago, I started receiving calls to pay my bill in full. At which time, I requested my cable service to be disconnected and for them to ensure that all Comcast services be terminated. Shortly thereafter, I started receiving daily calls either in person or on my voice mail telling me that I still had their equipment, which I had none of, and that I would not only be charged for but fined for keeping. I told them consistently that I didn't have their equipment and that they needed to be responsible for their own record keeping. I also let them know that the situation had become more than annoying on my end and that they were not welcome to call me anymore. As of today, I am still receiving harassing phone calls from Comcast and their contracting company CRC with the same accusations."
"Douglas of Beaverton, OR",6/17/2010,,"Comcast offers a DVR service. This purports to allow you to record a show (or shows) whilst watching another channel, or when you are away from home. Fine, in theory. Sadly the USA seems behind much of the rest of the world in this area? Comcast habitually starts shows a minute or two late. This means that a recording for 6-7 will chop off the final minute or so if the show starts at 6.01? Okay, they say just set the recorder to end a minute or two late. Fine but that means the machine sees that as an 'overlap' on a following show, which will either not be recorded at all, or will in its tune be shortened (in this case 'beheaded!')Most other countries have a system where the program carries a code, and when that hits the DVR, the DVR records, so it does not matter if the program is a minute or two late as it records by actual start not 'TV Guide ' start! Simple huh? Elegant too! This also takes care of those situations where you as otherwise find that and extra 2 million years tacked onto a football or baseball game has 'bounced' your favorite episode of Dora The Explorer' so you have some sweaty jocks instead of cartoon goodness.. lol.The other major failing is 'series recordings' where one can select 'only new episodes.' Fine except that apparently episodes are 'new' for as many times as Comcast decides to call them so! I want to record 'Curious George Finds the Last Intelligent Person at Comcast'. I set it up for Monday 7pm - 8pm. It records (bar the end as mentioned before so he never finds this mythical intelligent Comcast person) I watch the show and then delete it. When I come to watch another show, I set to record (say 'Comcast - Great frauds of the 21st Century') I find it has not recorded at all? For why? Because Comcast's cretinous cable DVR box does not 'remember' that I have recorded and watched and deleted the 'new' episode of the Curious George series recording, so as it appears as a 'new' episode it has recorded it again and bounced my recording of the other show! So, when is a repeat not a repeat? It's when it is a 'new' episode being shown for the 4th time that week! Of course nothing is ever a repeat in cable-land, it's an 'Encore Presentation.' Hmm.So, Comcast's box can neither record my shows reliably if they start or end late (as they very often do) or make sense of series recordings. Their engineers seem not even to understand the issues, let alone a possible cure, and when I try and bring this to their attention (telling them I am recording them) they tell me 'I am not allowed to do that' and hang up on me.. despite their own announcement that 'this call may be recorded' as they do not understand the difference between 'might be' and 'may be' where the word may gives implicit consent as in 'you may leave the table'. What a total waste of space they are. Given that we pay a premium for a DVR box and it is not fit for purpose I smell a class action here? "
"N. of Alpharetta, GA",6/17/2010,,"I asked to have service installed in my new place. I was told that Thursday between 8 and 11 am, the tech would arrive to install my three boxes, internet, and phone. The tech arrived on Thursday close to 3 hours late, smelling as if he'd been working on a roof top that was exposed to the hottest sun all morning. Nothing but sweat funk followed him into my home. As he fumbled around my home, he kept telling me things he could not do, like fix a line in my office that would allow the modem to be placed where I needed it, place a DVR in my bedroom as I'd requested, and provide a cord to go from the wall port to the DVR unit in my family room. I thought these were the basic functions of a technician, but I was told otherwise.All of this would have just been a minor annoyance if the next issues would not have occurred. I had to be in my front room to conduct a business call, as he was in my bedroom setting up. He seemed to be having a technical issue and had to contact the main office for a lengthy call to remedy the problem. My daughter walked out of her room and stood before me with a puzzled look on her face. She asked ""Daddy, did you say it was OK for him to be lying on your bed?!"" Now, this was not just lying on my bed linen. As I said, I was moving, so he was lying directly on my mattress, transferring the aforementioned epic odor to the part of the bed where I normally lie my head and face, as I am known to sleep upon my stomach. So ingrained in my mattress is the smell of armpit, back, and rear end, as well as a bit of mud on the edge. Originally, they offered a new mattress. But the claim was then denied by the contract company's boss, who said to me ""That's a bit of ** overkill."" Never again! My wife, plagued with leukemia, cannot sleep in our bed; neither can I."
"Jean of Woodland, wa",6/18/2010,,"I was shut off on Sunday night. They said because of past due. I paid the $338 plus first months and deposit and still, I have no service. That was $475.00. After Cody took the payment, he suddenly noticed that the service address had $1800.00 in past due. I and my roommate had filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy on everything but the $338.00. He said he would cancel the $475.00 transaction and it would be back on my card that day, the 15th of June. It is the 18th and I'm still without TV and my card still has a zero balance. I can't even call DirecTV because Comcast has my money. That's a week's pay, nobody can afford it."
"John of Macomb, MI",6/18/2010,,"After years of having ""less than basic"" cable we decided to ""upgrade.â€ Big mistake! Leave well enough alone. After 3 trips out to our house where we have to wait around 4 hours for each visit, we still do not have a functioning ""upgraded"" cable. They've also managed to ** up the internet so we do not have internet service either. I would highly discourage anybody from signing up with Comcast. When I spoke to a supervisor about the first mistake, he simply offered, ""That was the technician's error.â€ He refused to credit my account or offer anything for the inconvenience. Boycott Comcast until they learn how to provide decent customer service!"
"Terry of Chicago, IL",6/21/2010,,"There are several cable wires that lead from my house to the pole. I have attempted, many times, to have these wires either removed or raised. During a recent storm, they were pulled from the house and are lying on the ground. There are small children and animals at this residence. I have waited the entire day for a technician to show up for what I was originally told would be a 2pm appointment. I called the company at 1pm and was informed that this they have until 8pm to show up. I have been in the house the entire day because I am needed to unlock the gate."
"James of Barnegat, NJ",6/22/2010,,"I moved to a new address on May 28, 2010.  Erroneously, Comcast billed me for my old and new address for $179 & amp, and $155 respectively.  After contacting them on or around June 15, 2010, I was informed that I would receive a refund for my old account for $113.  The charges due on my new service had a due date of June 30, 2010.  On June 22, 2010,  I receive a statement noting my unpaid balance (again not due until June 30th) of $155 and new charges of $146.28 due by July 15, 2010. Customer service advised me that Comcast bills a month in advance for new service.  This was not brought to my attention when I spoke to a customer representative on June 15, 2010.  I was also informed that my refund would take 4 to 6 weeks to process. So in the meantime, Comcast wants a grand total of $301.38 by July 15, 2010.  Granted, I was assigned a new account number but realistically it is a continuation of old service, and not a new service.  It also was a convenient way of wiping out my refund. I requested to speak with a supervisor and was placed on hold.  After several minutes, the customer service representative informed me that no one was available at the present time and asked if I would continue to hold.  It was at this point that I stated that I would try again later."
"Bernette of Blaine, MN",6/23/2010,,"My service was disconnected without notice on 6/23/10. I am the manager of this community and I am supposed to receive a discount of which I have never had after numerous requests. I made a payment for 2 months on June 4th. When I called today, an incompetent rep told me there was no payment made. When I called back, they then said the routing number they input was incorrect so it was not posted. No courtesy letter or phone call was made. I made a payment today 6/23/10 approx. 10:00am which cleared immediately by debit card. I still have no phone or digital cable service and it is 12:41 pm. This was totally uncalled for."
"Karen of Hephzibah, GA",6/23/2010,,"I was sent letters and even a modem since Comcast was upgrading its system.  The letters stated that I needed a new modem and could go online to see the approved list of modems or rent one from them.  When I looked at the list, the modem I currently own was on the list.  I chatted with someone online about this and they said I would not have any problems if my modem was on the list.  Then, I received a modem in the mail.  I called to ask why I received the modem when the modem I owned was on the list.  The lady stated that the modem was indeed on the list and they just needed to verify that I had not changed modems without telling them.  She also stated that since my modem was on the list, I should not have any problems. This morning (upgrade was to happen yesterday) my modem does not work.  I was told it was at the end of its life and needed to be replaced.  I could see needing to replace the modem if it was not on the approved list.  But why do I need to replace an approved modem with another approved modem?  Comcast must be really off on their budget or they could care less about their customers."
"Sirce of Boca Raton, FL",6/24/2010,,"Completely unreliable in terms of stated promises. I spent most of the month of June attempting to get the basic bundle. Each agent I called gave me different prices. Most of the agents really didn't care that their attitudes were less than friendly. One supervisor was downright rude and didn't care that I didn't sign up. I was attracted to the DSL speed so kept on trying but to no avail. One phone call to the installation agent changed the price by an additional $5 during the phone call I was on! Once I made that agreement to have them come out, they made my husband wait until 10 pm and then cancelled the order altogether. They had not successfully ported my present phone number but didn't tell him that. When he got angry (time is money in our case) they wrote the notes down that he was angry and they cancelled the call and the order. When I got back from vacation, I called again to try to find out what happened. They only read back the notes they wanted to. When I set up yet another installation agreement, I reviewed all the items I was signing up for and they omitted the rebate of $250 that I was promised by the other three previous agents.I spoke to this new agent's supervisor who said that there were no notes about the rebate and that I was not eligible for it. My contention with her at that point was not the actual promised dollar rebate but the unreliability of the promises made by Comcast prior to even having them as a service. If they were this bad in managing their agents, then I was compelled by logic to believe they would be horrendous when push came to shove and I really hired them and then had a problem. They lost my business due to shoddy business management. A large company that they have become has lost touch with its core and its tendrils. I recommend staying far away from them. "
"Tiffany of Huntsville, AL",6/25/2010,,"On Monday June 21st, my cable went out around 4:45pm. I paid the bill and was told my service would be back on within moments. By 10pm my service was still off so I called the office and was told with 24 hours my service would be back on since they couldn't send a signal to get it back up from the office. On Tuesday morning, I called to verify what time my service would be back on and was told between 8-11am. I even had a tech call me afterwards to advise the same thing. I called at 11am to see why the tech hadn't gotten to my home yet and was told it would be 12noon when he'd arrive. No one still showed.I called again at 1:15 and was told it would be Wednesday between 8 -11. By then I was very angry because my husband had sat at home all morning waiting on them to come and no one ever showed. When I told the rep this, she said that no one even needed to be home! I was livid at this point. I called back at 3p.m. and was told again it would be Wednesday before my service would be connected. Wednesday morning I called the office again at 9 to verify a tech would be here and was advised they would be here between 8-11. By 11, no one had shown up so I called and requested a manager. I spoke with a man named Chris who said he'd called dispatch and confirmed a tech would be here no later than 1:30pm. No one showed again. I called back for the 7th time!I asked why no one had come and was advised I had an all day appointment set so it could take up to 7pm to get my service back. I advised that wasn't acceptable but was told that was the timeframe so all they could do is give me a $20 credit on my next bill and credit my time for being out of service. I did not like the service I was getting at all so when I got off work at 3pm Wednesday, I decided to go to the office to complain in person. I was given a copy of the work order when I asked what guarantee I had that the tech would come by 7pm since I'd been told 3 previous appointment times and no one showed any of those times. She said well you'll get a $20 credit on your bill for a missed appointment.I told her that I was very dissatisfied and never in the 14 years that I'd been a Comcast customer had I incurred such poor service. Her response was that she was just getting in the middle of something that had already occurred and was only giving me the info she had. I thought that was VERY RUDE. I work in a customer service environment as well and never in a million years would I have told one of my customers that. Needless to say I finally got cable around 5:40pm Wednesday evening but I think something needs to be done about this. I wasted 3 days of my time on the phone and was told different info each time I called. I was with no service for 3 days and threatened to go to another cable provider but no one tried to escalate getting my service back on quicker. I am still seriously considering going to another cable provider. I work for the telephone company and they provide direct TV for a discounted rate that is a lot cheaper than Comcast, but I didn't go with them because I'd always been happy with the service. I definitely am not now!"
"Thomas of Powder Springs, GA",6/27/2010,,"The previous Comcast Cable quality problem request resulted in a the Comcast tech destroying my central cable junction box by breaking off the cable ends to trace the signal. Comcast refused to return calls. When Comcast converted from analog to digital I refused until I could no longer watch any reasonable program. When I had to go digital, we were scheduled to receive the equip by mail (without having to deal with another scumbag Comcast contractor). He showed up unannounced!. It is now 30 days later and the digital service sucks! When I use the remote, it takes at least 4 seconds to change channels!. When you hit the button the transmission freezes, then you receive a 2 second freeze frame of another channel and finally the transmission of the channel selected. After 3 service calls the Comcast response is ""there is a bad connection somewhere in the area and it is affecting about 30 customers, but we have not found the problem"". Comcast is very similar to the old AT&T with the attitude of ""sit down shut and pay the bill"". But I will soon do the same thing for Comcast with what I did for AT&T and BS (Bell South), I will fire them! I am just waiting for the wireless internet to drop in price and Comcast and all it trash employees go go look for a new job."
"Barb of Coatesville, PA",6/28/2010,,"Well, let's just say Comcast keeps reeling me back in and I never learn my lesson! In April 2010, I was solicited by a sales rep for Comcast regarding their service. We decided on a 7-room installment, internet and phone. He stated that my bill would be anywhere from $170.00-180.00/month. Since I was moving, he guaranteed me next-day installation at my new home.I was shocked to see the technician arrive at my home. He was there for 6 hours. He completed 4 of the rooms and only hooked up 2 phone jacks and the internet. He stated that he could not complete the installation, because he would have to drill holes on the outside of my house to get the cable installed in the remaining rooms. He then stated that he would return to finish the room. Well, if anyone has ever moved before, you know that cable is the last thing on your mind. We never received our first bill (so darn typical of Comcast). Then we were surprised to see a bill in May for over $400.00. So my husband decided to contact Comcast, and as usual, if you owe a balance, you can't get through. Finally in June, we were able to get through, thanks to a friend who works for Comcast. My husband spoke with a young man by the name of Stefan who guaranteed that we would receive some type of compensation for the inconvenience of only having 4 rooms installed and for the phone. Well, my husband was so happy for him being so understanding. He stated, ""Don't worry about the phone issue; we can live with only having phone usage in 2 rooms."" What a wrong thing to do! Stefan also guaranteed that a tech would be by that Saturday to finish the installation (which happened 2 months later!) and that we will receive a new bill with the credits. Although my husband had not wanted to pay a thing until it was corrected, he paid 1/2 of the bill. His philosophy: 1/2 the payment for 1/2 the work! So as promised, a technician was out to complete the job (and he didn't have to drill outside!). This was on 6/12/10. Well, needless to say, it is now 6/28; and we have no phone or cable. And God only knows when the internet will go down. So we contacted Comcast and spoke with Josie who stated that there was no record of the credits (Go figure!) and that she would need to email Stefan to find out what type of credit he was going to issue! (So we were to wait all over again!) So I decided not to wait. I immediately called back and spoke with Roz and asked for a supervisor or manager; she refused to patch me through. She said that she needed to get info from me. Needless to say, I never spoke with a supervisor. I explained my situation to her, and she stated, ""Well, on 4/19, we credited your account $79.50 for the installation."" There wasn't supposed to be a charge for the installation! And she said that the most she could do was credit the remaining $51.95 for the installation. Again, there wasn't supposed to be an installation fee! And that is not good enough! We have gone 2 1/2 months without the proper installation. She then stated that she couldn't do anything else because we were only charged for the package and the 2 HD boxes. But hold on, our package was for a 7-room installation! What in the world! So needless to say, after speaking with Roz, she transferred me to Jennifer in collections who started by saying that we were not getting another credit for anything else, even after I explained our situation. She said that we needed to make up our mind as to what we were going to do because our account was in the red and that we haven't made a payment since we started the services. What?! I was furious by this time and stated that my husband paid over $200.00 with Stephan via a debit card. She looked and saw the payment and said, ""Still you need to pay the $208.00 before your services will be turned back on and you need to decide what you are going to do!"" What kinda customer services does Comcast think they are providing?! Since they basically cornered the market in my area, we are pretty much stuck with them! Comcast needs to remember that it is customers like me who provide them the money to pay their bills, not the CEO. Without the customer, you would not have a job!"
"Edwardo of Houston, TX",6/28/2010,,"On Feb 25, 2010, my Jeep was stolen from my then address of ** from the parking lot. In my jeep was my wallet with my identity and all of my credit, bank, and yes, my social. I filed a police report immediately and waited. My jeep was recovered but not my identification nor were any of my cards or Soc. I figured things would smooth over, but my everything went crazy and am just now able to put things back together. Three weeks ago I applied for Comcast cable and found that there are already accounts open in my name which I didn't have any knowledge of. I reported it to the police and they instructed me to give my report number to the Fraud dept. They wouldn't take it. They told me all of these things I needed to send to them by fax. I did and still have not heard anything back. Can you help? I need my name cleared."
"Jytte of Miramar, FL",6/29/2010,,"We have been loyal Comcast customers for 10 years. We moved county and had to change account. This is when trouble started. We bought a new HD and 3D TV and consulted with Comcast to ensure we would get the services from them. Yes, 3D is available, I was told. 4 DVR/digital boxes and five technicians later and approximately 20 hours total phone calls during the 4 weeks, we still don't have 3D. Comcast agents have no clue when it is available here in Florida. Two weeks ago I was told June 29 and I received the right box to be able to receive it. Today is June 29 and after 3 hours (no kidding) on the phone since 7 am with Comcast, I was told by different agents: 1. you do no have the right box (incorrect); 2. you have the wrong TV (incorrect); 3. we need to send a technician to fix the problem (will be available in 3 days); 4. 3D is not available in your area yet; 5. and it's not a problem specific to you but several customers.All within 3 hours different agents made these statements and decided that there was nothing else they could do. I was trying to speak with a supervisor who could shed some light on the situation, but agents hung up on me instead. This is a typical example of my day on the phone with Comcast. I'm ready to switch to satellite. Unfortunately our home owner association has a contract with Comcast, which we opted in on when we moved here, anticipating they would be able to live up to their commitment. This has resulted to 20 hours of phone calls resulting in lost work/revenue on my side. Trying to get out of the home owners association's basic cable agreement with Comcast. We do not want to pay for services we no longer get after we switch to satellite."
"Rose of Newburyport, MA",6/29/2010,,"I decided to reduce my TV service to basic cable. Iâ€™m being charged $150.00 (plus the bill), saying there was ""an agreement"" for another year. Thought I was safer than paying over $115.00 a month for internet and TV, until they told me it has to be paid within thirty days or both services will be shut off. I called the ""billing"" number and Iâ€™m being charged $4.00 to speak with a rep (added to the bill), and now I am being charged late fees (pro rated) plus the bill and the fee to reduce my services. Comcast is a nightmare for people who are on fixed income and trying to meet their other bills, like rent and utilities and food. And in this area, there is no one else to go to. Iâ€™m trying struggle on a fixed income to pay other monthly bills and still can't watch a decent program on TV. Complaining doesn't get you anywhere. I contacted the FCC and tried to find out who makes these fees, and why, and I was told itâ€™s company policy. No other utility company does it. Thanks for letting me vent."
"Vincent of Vacaville , CA",6/29/2010,,"Comcast offers online specials, $84.99 for 6 months premium service. But they are unable to add it to my service. It took 3 hours to and two trips to local office, add it to my online account 2 times, and had it confirmed with online chat two times. I did not realize you have to fight with them to pay them $84.99 dollar a month and hook it up yourself. They acted like they don't want you as a customers. So, if that's what they want I am sure AT&T would love to have my $84.99 a month. This was the worst ever customer service. Lack of training. Customer service did not know any of the codes to enter, to get there advertised package. Overall "" False Advertising"". As I am a diabetic this was a emotional and stressful three hours and dropped blood sugars to dangerous low 43."
"Antoine of Detroit, MI",7/1/2010,,"Our Comcast service was turned off, so a representative left a notice on the door stating they needed to collect the boxes, my mother called the number on the notice and spoke with John. She informed him of the time that would be good to pick up the boxes, he stated he wouldnâ€™t be in the area at that time, but he would be doing another time and he would call her to see if she or myself maybe home doing that time. When he called my Mom informed him that no one was home and that we would take the boxes in to the service center, this must have been on a Thursday. On Sunday my 15 year old brother called my mom and told her the Comcast man had came and he had him gone from room to room with him and had taken the cable boxes. John should not have entered our home and went from room to room with 15 year old. I thought a person 18 or over had to be present and I didnâ€™t think they were allowed to enter my home and go room to room to get anything. I have complaint to Comcast and they said John supervisor would call, never heard from the supervisor. Last week another Comcast representative came to collect the boxes also, the boxes had been taken by John 2-3 week earlier. I called Comcast back again, and ask why was someone else at my home to collect boxes that had alright been collected, when she looked on their system it finally showed up the boxes where returned. The representative was very rude, I was told by her that a Comcast person can enter my home even if the isn't an adult and collect their equipment. I was very upset by their rudeness and lack of professionalism and lack of communication."
"Todd of Palm beach gardens, fl",7/2/2010,,"In May 2009, I entered into contract to upgrade my services with Comcast. I was told I would receive cable, phone service and the highest available speed internet service for the price of $114.99 all inclusive (taxes, modem, etc.). I confirmed the price and services with the Comcast representative at least six times to make sure there was no misunderstanding. I agreed to the offer as offered to me by the Comcast representative. I have since been overcharged twice, the first time was an ""error"" of approximately $30-35 (which was later resolved). My last bill was for $130.31, not the $114.99 I was repeatedly promised. Calls to Comcast (Ann/May?) to resolve the matter were absolutely useless (she claimed the extra charges were for modem rental and taxes, neither of which were stated as ""extra charges"" by the original representative when I accepted). I had been told each time I asked that the $114.99 cost included everything and a promise of a call from the supervisor from that representative never came. I went to the local Comcast office on Tuesday where not only was it not resolved, but I was informed I was not even getting the promised highest speed internet either. On 9/14, I called the Comcast escalation department and spoke to David. I was essentially told, 'I'm sorry, but these are our packages and prices and there's nothing we can do"". He suggested that I ""misunderstood"". I find it difficult to accept that I ""misunderstood"" an offer I confirmed 6 times with their very own representative. I am not being provided the agreed-upon contracted services and I am being overcharged even for the services I am receiving. The ""package"", as described to me since by Comcast's subsequent representatives (Ann/May/David), is one I would never have agreed to or accepted had it been offered to me at the time. Comcast and its representatives are practicing price gouging and fraud. I can't see why I should have to pay a bill that is in excess to what I was told six times and is not providing the promised, offered and agreed to contracted services. All attempts to resolve this with Comcast have proven absolutely fruitless. Update: I received a call from Richard **, Executive Support/Research Specialist, West Palm Beach Region Office of the Vice President ** approximately 2 weeks ago. After explaining my complaint with the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services against Comcast, he told me he would get back to me next week and they would try to work something out to my satisfaction. No offer was made and today, I received a letter from the DOA and CS claiming they had closed my case, following correspondence from Mr. ** which consisted of false and misleading information on his part. As of 9/2/2010, continued attempts to resolve this dispute with Comcast have met with absolute refusal on their part to honor their agreement."
"Joe of Vineland, nj",7/2/2010,,"I have problems after buying a Comcast internet modem, my wired of cable in the house worked just fine but the company could not get signals back from my modem after days of struggles on the phone. So, I cancelled the order and they said if you want to pay a technician we may be able to connect you. Now continuing to be a Comcast cable TV customer, I cannot get a signal on the new mandated dig converter boxes again. I spend days on the phone getting technician appointments etc. They cannot activate them and said I have to pay a technician to see what is wrong. Of course prior, my wires for Comcast cable to my TV were fine.Now the point is if you want adjustments to service which are the company's responsibility you have to pay us or you get nothing. Now I am being charged $59.00/ month for about $20.00/ month work of services. When the special trouble shooter set up a technician to visit my house, the technician never showed even though they confirmed on the phone and I waited. They just never showed this is the nature of the service you must pay for what you get if you don't like what you get you can kiss our butts."
"Mary of Mount Laurel, NJ",7/3/2010,,"From day one, Comcast has been a horrible experience with service. We initially signed up for the Triple Play in 2007. After sending 3 different techs on 3 different occasions, we finally got the service we ordered. The out cable line from the Comcast cable box to the house was exposed on the lawn for over a year. We made numerous phone calls before Comcast finally returned to bury the cable. This was a huge safety issue. In 2008, our phone was shut off. We contacted Comcast and were told that we could no longer keep the telephone number and a new number was assigned to us without our choice. In June of 2010 while reviewing my Comcast bill, I noticed that we were being charged twice for internet service. I contacted Comcast and was told there was an error on the bill going back to December of 2007. The Comcast Rep informed me that someone would be calling me back in two days to determine how the account would be credited. The estimated amount of what we were overcharged was approx. $1,400. No one ever called back so I contacted Comcast again. The Comcast Rep reiterated what the previous Rep had told us. Finally, someone called us and informed us that we were only double charged from January of 2009. I explained that this was incorrect and wanted copies of all my bills. I was told they would not provide me copies and the that they would credit my account for over $700. The bill makes no sense now as they have entered several credits in various amounts which are difficult to interpret. Since contacting Comcast in June of 2009, the phone and internet service keeps going out throughout the day. On the evening of July 2, 2010, I contacted Comcast regarding the outage. The Comcast Rep stated someone would be out on July 6th. I explained that this was unacceptable. After speaking with a Comcast supervisor, I was told a Comcast Tech would be sent out on July 3rd between 1 and 3 pm. At 10:30 am on July 3rd, I received an automated message to confirm that we still needed a Comcast Tech. I replied yes. At 3:20 pm, I called Comcast as no one had showed up. The Comcast Rep put me hold and later said the Tech was running behind and that I would receive a phone call in 15 to 20 minutes. At 4:30 pm, I contacted Comcast again as no one had called. The Comcast Rep stated that the Tech phoned us at 1:10 pm but no one answered. I explained that we have been home all day and no one called my cell phone nor did I have any messages. The Rep stated we would have to reschedule for later in the week. I stated that this was unacceptable. After being on hold for 30 minutes, the Rep stated that he was working with his supervisor to find an available Tech. The Rep stated that I would receive a call back. I am still waiting. No phone call. How does Comcast get away with billing customers improperly, never showing up for scheduled appointments and poor customer service."
"Anne of West Hartford, CT",7/4/2010,,They are persistently overcharging. They have had repeated failure over months to cancel an account in spite of confirming cancellation on the phone.
"Jan of Elkhart, IN",7/5/2010,,"We, the apartment dwellers at **, are extremely unhappy with the treatment we received from your ""customer service"" people during the cable outage in Buildings C, H, and K between Wednesday (6/23/10) night's storm and the time the cable was finally restored on Saturday (6/26/10) morning around 10AM. Several of us, your cable customers, called various customer service numbers and even drove out to the Comcast offices on Protecta, DR. We were told over and over that (a) there was no record of an outage at our address, (b) everyone would have to call in to make it so and that several calls from the same address would activate a ""red flag"", (c) just because I said there was an outage and at least 24 apartments were affected, ""Tony"" couldn't take my word for it and each cable customer would have to schedule a repair appointment, individually, to have his/her cable fixed and appointments were out to June 30th and July 1st and on, (d) that I didn't need to get angry since he was only telling me that there was no outage in our area according to his computer. When I asked for a supervisor, I was transferred to someone called ""Nate"" who had no more tact than Tony and once again, he told me there was no outage listed at ** and that there was nothing he could do. Earlier that day, Doris **'s (age 81) daughter had called Comcast Cable Customer Service and was told there was no outage. She responded that she had better things to do than call cable service just for the heck of it. The customer service person said there was nothing she could do, so Doris's son-in-law drove to Protecta, DR and was told they would send someone around 2PM. Mid-afternoon Friday, Bonnie ** called a customer service number (she was just at home from the hospital, recovering from foot surgery) and reached someone in Mexico, who told her there was no outage in our area.Someone did come out around 4PM or so and said ""yes, we had an outage"". That they had found that there was a short somewhere and he had called for more technicians. He said that he had sent an email and customer service should now be aware of the situation. Then by 4:40, he was gone. I called a customer service number and a very nice customer service person in Woodridge, IL told me that there was no outage listed for our area. If a lot of people really had called, something would send an alert. When I insisted that there was indeed an outage, Maria ** put me on hold for awhile and came back to report that she had called ""dispatch"", that there was an outage, they were working on it and would work late to get it repaired. Later that evening, when there were no cable trucks to be seen, Bobbie ** called and was told by a customer service person that no outage was listed for ** and that she could schedule a repair for July 1st.Your internal communications (among and between how many locations?) seem to be totally disconnected from each other. Obviously, several calls from ** did not raise a red flag. Steve ** also called, as did Diane **, and most I've mentioned are in my building. I don't know how many from the other buildings called. When customers call to report a cable outage, they do not appreciate being told basically that what we're telling them isn't true. Since your customer service people can do nothing, cannot contact someone to investigate, cannot seem to communicate with each other, it's apparent that you really do not care about your customers as your recordings say you do. Since it did not matter that your customers (at ** address) did indeed call in several times over 48+ hours, were consistently brushed off and were treated like second class citizens, we protest your raising rates every few months with no evident upgrade in service. We have no other cable options, thus, we have to ""take it"".When I offered up names of others who had called to Tony, he said he could not check into that. Why not? We are extremely dissatisfied and still angry with your response to us. We ask you for a response to this and we want to know how you are going to fix your customer service communications and behavior. Why did it not register that there were more than a dozen calls from this address? We look forward to hearing from you and we ask also for a monetary discount on our bills for the grief we were given. It should not be incumbent on each and every customer here at E Bristol, who was without cable from Wednesday night until Saturday morning, to call you individually (as your customer service has told us). Your customers deserve better."
"Melanie of Baytown, TX",7/5/2010,,"Let me first start by stating that I live in an area where the only high-speed cable access is provided by Comcast. I have continually had a problem with slow speed with Comcast's premium connection. I've called in the past, and every time I am directed through troubleshooting procedure which includes checking cables, unplugging modem, etc. This process works, but lately my speed diminishes on a daily basis. The way I approach the problem these days is to call the automated line and get a signal refresh. Like magic this method works every time.Given the current negotiations between the FCC and ISP providers and the latest attempt to charge according to data use, I believe Comcast limits my connection speed until I call them. There is no doubt in my mind that I am paying a premium price for a sub-par service. Anybody that tells you that you get what you pay for in this Country is full of it. It simply is not true. Until we get real consumer protections again, moreover regulatory laws with regard to ISP services, save yourself the hassle and call for a refresh signal."
"Mike of Tamarac, FL",7/7/2010,,"After over an hour on the phone attempting to talk to someone in authority, the connection was dropped for the fourth time. What is wrong with this company? Great! You credit me for 1 month of Internet service then have the audacity to charge me a Cut Ed fee? What the ** is that?"
"Frances of Marietta, GA",7/8/2010,,"In Feb. 2010, I disconnected my service with Comcast to change to another provider. I asked the billing department what the amount would be for my final bill. At this time, I was told that I had a zero balance. Next, I was transferred to the retention department and spoke with Naim who also told me I had a zero balance. On February 19, 2010, I called Comcast again as I received a bill of $82.09. Again, I was told by the billing department that I did not owe anything. Approximately, about six weeks later, around April 2010, I received a collection notice for this amount and called the Executive Office in Atlanta, GA. I spoke with Ms. **** who stated that this problem would be resolved and she had Archie ****  from the Executive Office in Atlanta to follow up with me. He assured me that he would â€˜take care of thisâ€™ and that it would be a zero balance on my account. Ms. **** called me back to follow up and I told her that Mr. **** had resolved the issue.Since that time, I have received three more collection notices, stating that I still owe $82.09 and that this was being put on my credit report. I called the Corporate Executive Office in Philadelphia trying to resolve this issue. Each time, I was told that someone in Atlanta would call me back and this would be resolved. I have unsuccessfully been able to get Comcast to honor what I was told by four of their representatives. The customer service has been terrible. I have left at least 15 messages asking for the Executive Office to call me and when I am able to finally talk to someone, they have insinuated that I was to blame for their mistake. Archie **** then informed me that I have two accounts which was the first time I heard this as most people only have one account with a cable company and that this was a valid amount owed. I have called several more times but with no response. A few message have been left for me, about 3 to 4, but when I return the call, no one answers the phone at the numbers I am given. They have not apologized for their mistake and stated that they will not take this off of my credit report. Now, no one will not answer my calls or return my messages. They also told me that â€˜nothing else will be doneâ€™ and that I could not speak with the President/CEO of Comcast as they have the final say in this matter. They, the Executive office, handles everything, and no letters, calls, etcetera will past their office.Comcast actions are deplorable, and I have never seen a company that was as unprofessional, rude, and hostile [their] organization has been. They never admitted that they made a mistake regarding telling me that I had a $0 balance, and even told me that I ""deliberately did not want to pay my bill"" (Archie Jackson told me this). No amount of reasoning on my part with Comcast could get this resolved, or to have it removed from my credit report. My issue has never been whether I owed this amount, as I initiated the call for the final balance, but the issue is I was told I didn't owe this amount on several occasions. Although I have now paid the bill, I feel that Comcast should be held accountable for their accounting error, and blatant disrespect regarding how they have treatment me. It is misleading to not tell a customer that they have two active accounts without their knowledge, when I was only aware of the one that I had at my current address. I personally do not want to ever be a Comcast customer again! Comcast has always had terrible customer service and I have complained to them several times over the years about this, but this time they have really gone too far. I am asking you to please investigate this matter. I can be reached, and I thank you for taking the time to read my letter. This has been put on my credit report affecting my credit rating."
"A of Hermitage, TN",7/9/2010,,"I have been a Comcast customer for many years. We do not have many choices for cable providers, so it is either Comcast or the Dish Network. After having a tree limb fall on our power lines, the electric service had to come and cut all the lines leading to our home, including the cable line. Within a couple of hours our electricity had been restored. I then called Comcast to tell them that I would need someone to come and repair our cable lines. I was told that it would be 48 hours to get someone to our home. I was not pleased with this response, but I agreed.Now 48 hours, 4 phone calls and one internet chat later, I still have no service. I was promised at 4:40 pm today that someone would definitely be out to restore our service only to find out their office closes at 5:00 pm. Now this leads me to believe that this supervisor (Ed) made a promise just to get me off of the phone. I am still sitting here, 3 hours later with no cable service. I pay over $220 a month for all the HD, internet, DVR and special perks of this cable company. This is horrible customer service and if people had other options they could boycott Comcast and put them out of business. I am over these big companies treating the hard working people of this country like this. Now just speaking to the call center, they again apologized for the confusion. So, this is not fair."
"Chelsea of Visalia, CA",7/11/2010,,"We moved into our place in Sept of 2009. On the first week of living here, we decided to get cable TV and internet through Comcast. Six months of making appointments and nobody was showing up to do the installation. One appointment every month for six months and nobody ever called or showed up. So, we went through with Dish Network for cable. However, we still needed internet. After one last call to Comcast to see about maybe their showing up this time. We called on 7-8-10 and they made yet another appointment for the next Sunday (today) 7-11-10 between 12 and 2pm. They actually showed up. Only this time the tech looked at our wall and said he needed to drill a hole. We said okay. He went outside and called his ""superior"" who then showed up and told us that even though every house around us had Comcast service that we cannot get the internet here through their company. They gave some excuse about some pole that exceeds a 250 ft limit; some garbage about aerial trespassing."
"Martha of Grass Valley, CA",7/11/2010,,"I requested my service to be transfer to my new address. At first, I was told that a technician was coming on July 6th and I was given a time frame between 8 am to 12 pm. This day, at 9 am, I called to make sure they were coming. At that time, the customer service representative advised me that they were not coming on this day but on July 9th. I explained that I was given that date and I didn't understand why they changed the date without previous notice. This lack of responsibility form Comcast caused me to lose 2 hours from work but they could care less about it and they just limit themselves to say, ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience.""Then, I was given a different date which I changed due to personal reasons. The new day for the technician to come to my new address was today, Sunday, July 10 between 8 am and 10 am. At 9:30 am, I went online and contacted a customer service representative via online chat. All this person did was apologize and tell me that they were going to be here. They didn't show up at 10 am. At 10:45 am, I contacted again via online chat. This new representative said sorry for the delay but never solved the problem. It is now 11 am and so far,I have not received a phone call from the technician, advising of the delay or anything else. I'm cancelling my services with this company for lack of professionalism. In addition, they have been charging me for a HD box when I got tired of telling them that I do not own a HD TV."
"Shelley of Nashua, NH",7/11/2010,,"My landline and internet connection has been down now for three days. This has been an ongoing problem since we signed on to Comcast's bundle a few years ago. We have been told it's a wiring problem which a tech had been sent out to fix. We've been told it's our other phone in another room (which we do not have). Now we've been told ""there's a service problem in your area, our technicians know about it and are working on correcting it.""After 3 days you'd think they'd have figured it out. No customer rep knows who the district manager is for my area so I can't call them to complain. No one knows who the CEO is so I can't call him/her to complain. I am so tired of dealing with customer service. They cannot resolve our phone issue, and it's not just my phone but neighbors as well. You call this service? Comcast should stick with cable and forget about their ""phone & internet"" services."
"Darren of Miami, FL",7/13/2010,,"Back in February 2010, I switched our telephone, high-speed internet, and cable TV services over to the Comcast Xfinity plan.  My previous provider on the phone lines was AT&T.  Everything seemed okay at first.  But in July, I accidentally set off my alarm system.  We did not receive the customary call from our alarm system service, so I called them.  They stated that it was probable that Comcast had not installed the line for the alarm properly and I should call them.  I called Comcast and arranged for a technician to come on a Saturday.  The young man arrived, looked around, messed with some wires, and then asked me to test.  It still did not work.  A woman from the alarm system company told us that it was still a problem with Comcast.  The young man said she didn't know what she was talking about etc. and that I should have a technician from the alarm company come out.  I did this, and the young man promptly took off. After a long rainstorm, I went into the backyard and found the phone line access box open with a mass of wires drooping down the side of the house, which I placed in the box as best as I could and closed the panel.  I then went to log onto the internet to attend my online college courses, only to find that I had no internet!  Then, when I picked up the phone, I found I had no phone access!  I called Comcast on my cell, only to be given attitude.  After some discussion, I was told it would be escalated to a supervisor who would call me within the hour.  24 hours later, since I had received no phone call, I called Comcast again and went through the whole explanation, only to be offered another visit from the technician in two days time.  The only times offered were working hours.  So, my wife is taking time off of work to meet the technician again.  This caused loss of class time, which will result in at least one letter grade in one class.  And this caused loss of leave time used to meet with technicians.  Also, this caused months of loss of security for a disabled alarm system."
"Greg of Jacksboro, TN",7/13/2010,,"It is this bouncing of internet speeds that limits the Internets usefulness. I start streaming a movie then because of speed issues, it either downgrades signal or stops playing. They know I have an issue b/c they can see my ping speeds are excessive it is the fixing I can't get taken care of."
"Christine of Riverdale, IL",7/14/2010,,"Last month, we signed up with Comcast for our internet & upgrade of our cable service. Nothing has worked properly since that time. My husband has been on the phone with technicians and representatives countless times. We don't get half of the channels we are suppose to be getting or if we do get them, they are scrambled. Since when does channels 2/5/7 & 9 not come in. Our internet service is pathetic. Lets put it this way, if we want to use our internet service, we have to wait until after 5:00 p.m. It never works before that. It always is saying Comcast is having a server problem or Comcast's server is slow today. The whole problem is Comcast's infrastructure. We live in a low-income area where most of the people can't even afford cable. Comcast ignores replacing old lines with new ones in those areas. They don't care! My husband is getting ready to call Comcast one more time this afternoon. If Comcast does not get on the stick and fix this problem, they lost a customer. I will cancel my phone, cable and internet and go elsewhere. I am not going to pay close to $200.00 per month for something that works not even half the time. Would you? In this economy, no one has money to throw away."
"Michelle of East Haven, CT",7/14/2010,,"I am moving out of my current residence in about two weeks. Cable service was set up about a month ago for my new residence. I had ordered the service in my name with no one else on the account. My roommate had to call Comcast last night about his wife's account with who he is separated from. Comcast ask him which account ""You have three."" One of the three accounts was my new address. They verfied that his name and social security number was on the account. He freaked out and had them cancel the install. Now I never gave them permission to put him on the account nor did he give them permission to put his name on the account. I was at work when he found this out. He called me up and left three nasty voice mails accusing me of identity theft and fraud and was going to have me prosecuted. I had called Comcast. The first person hung up on me and the second asked me ""What do you want me to do?"""
"Igor of Bloomfield, ct",7/14/2010,,"I had Comcast service in Charleston, SC. I moved to CT in December 2009. At that time, I was due a refund of $118. It is July 2010, and I still have not received my refund. I called customer service department at least 5 times and spoke to 5 different reps (Angelia, Michelle, Angela, Sarah, and Tony). They all promised to look into the issue and to call me back. None of them ever did call back.I'm starting to think that Comcast has an unofficial policy against issuing refunds; otherwise, I can't explain why in 7 months I have not been able to receive my money back. The refund of $118 has not been received."
"Ben of Avon, CT",7/15/2010,,"This is just the latest in a series of Comcast customer service nightmares. I am named on the account as is my wife. Since I pay the bill, I wanted to pay it online. Of course, there is no easy way to do this so I called Comcast. I talked to 4 different people and got 4 different answers. One said that both my wife and I would have to go to a service center and show ID photos to get my name as the one that pays the account. Finally, I asked to talk to a supervisor. I was told that the supervisor was not available. I said that I would wait. After insisting that I wasnâ€™t going anywhere, a supervisor got on and said that they would email me a form to fill out which I would then have to bring to a service center and there is a $10 fee.My wife was with me when I called. She could have gotten on and verified her SSN. All I wanted to do is pay them online. It is a benefit to them yet I have to pay them $10 to change that pays them? People thought Enron took people for a ride. With my last problem with Comcast, it was not resolved until I emailed the president of Comcast. They are a nightmare to deal with. If I had a viable alternative I would drop them in a minute."
"Margo of Oakland, CA",7/15/2010,,"I had a $10.02 balance, unknown to me, when I moved a year ago. Comcast never contacted me. Although, I opened a new account immediately. I never received a phone call or letter. The amount went into collection.I have been in contact with the collection agency, who told me to file a complaint with Comcast. I tried to do that but Comcast says they have no information on file, so they cannot help me. It seems unjustified to me that my bill went into collections without me even having a chance to deal with it. I do plan on paying this as soon as I receive the bill from the collection agency."
"Faraha of Fairfield, CA",7/16/2010,,"My cable bill was due and was going to be shut off. I received a call from a representative for Comcast who wanted to see if I could make a payment to prevent the cable from being shut off. I said I did not get paid till the 15th and will call and make a payment then. The representative said he wanted to save me from paying reconnect fees and stated I could make a payment arrangement through my checking account. Just to choose a date and Comcast would take it out then and if I needed an extension to call them two days prior to the date. I agreed and setup a payment for the 15th of July and he gave me a confirmation number and a guarantee. The next day I get a notice that my account is overdrawn. Comcast took out the payment the same day. I immediately called Comcast who states they won't do anything since itâ€™s not their policy to take post dated checks and the employee who told me so would be disciplined. They would not refund my checking account, the overdrafts fees or even send a letter to my bank but they would credit my Comcast account. My account is completely overdrawn and all the bills I had setup to go through have been returned with fees. These bills would have gone through had it not been for Comcast."
"Amy of Beaverton , OR",7/16/2010,,"Sales reps came to the door and I spent an hour with them understanding and making sure that I would have a better deal than with Verizon. They quoted me (in writing) $65 a month. Within three months, my bill was at almost 3 times as much, over my original Verizon bill. The also did not wire my house correct either, which was an irritation but after my bill went through the roof, it really made me mad. I have had Comcast in WA for over 10 years with no problems. Here, nothing but problems. They have over 150 complaints with the Attorney Generals office here for the same type of practice. They are crooks and I don't say that often. So, I have had to change again to reduce my bill. But in the meantime, I had these horribly high bills-- just what you need in this recession. I was trying to reduce my cost."
"Bart of St.. Helens, OR",7/18/2010,,"I downgraded from Digital Starter package, as it was way too expensive, and went back to Basic Cable service. I was still overcharged.  I called again and wanted to cancel my TV service, but they sent me to Customer Retentions, who promised me the service I was previously quoted for Digital Starter would be honored, so I was happy, and agreed.  At the same time, I was quoted a 1-year lock-in at $33 per month for my high-speed internet. 6 months later, Comcast jacked the price up to nearly double.I called again, and they argued with me, telling me that the deal they gave me was not possible. I again pulled the plug on my TV service. Again, I was directed to Retentions, and Anna, the rep, guaranteed me a fixed rate of $61.37 per month for the next 6 months for Digital Starter TV plus internet. The next bill arrived in the amount of $107!  I called again, furious at being constantly lied to, but this time they refused to honor their own agreement, so I canceled the TV service and had them prove I still get internet for $33/month with no modem rental. At this point, I will refuse to ever pay anything higher. They are way overpriced, and do not offer individual TV stations, only their ridiculous ""package deals"", where you get to buy stations you will never watch, at a very high price. They do not honor their promises to you. Their billing department is destroying them. I hope they sink, and fast! With FiOS becoming available, I will switch over in a heartbeat.Comcast can rot in their own created sewer. People, do not ever subscribe to Comcast's inferior products and services. You will be robbed and cheated! I have no other experienced consequences, other than the effect they have on my bank account. "
"Danilo of Chickasaw, AL",7/20/2010,,"We are new to Alabama. We were moved here by United Van Lines/King Relocator/Car Transport. Danilo requested service at this private property in Legg Park. During May, he requested wireless service and through many calls, was unable to connect the service. We have two computers, one Mac Apple and one Windows PC. We wanted service so we could use both computers. In June, after another failed attempt, Danilo asked what the additional cost would be for a second modem which we are guaranteed in the privacy of our home 8MG. On June 11th, an installation tech came to our home and installed a second modem. We discovered that we can only have 1MG with the second modem. We called Comcast whom we allowed to enter our private home to provide this service. We were told that this service will be $5 more a month. We called to talk to Comcast and were told we can not have more MG because we wanted 2 modem. We were told we could only have better connection if we had the wireless. When explained the failed connection, there was no resolution. We received a bill for double the amount or 60 a month for internet. We felt that this is fraud because we were told 8MG and only have 1MG. We were falsely led to believe that this would only be an additional $5 but were charged like two household instead of one.This seems to be non-disclosure. I spoke clearly, I said I do not like this, like they entered our home with the intent to defraud us of money, make us pay for their fraud, false advertisement, lack of disclosure in the privacy of our home. They never said they did not understand English, they never said they did not know what I said, but intended to use our sincere intents for fraud and money gains. When told there was a problem, they said there is no solution and no correction, but we must pay for lack of disclosure. They don't know what they are doing or where they are. They cannot hear and refused to listen to what is being said. I returned the modem after being told that they will not correct this and will charge us double for what we will not get. They walked in to the privacy of our home to commit fraud. They are using our home to make money and refuse to respect, communicate. They are actually insulting. They were offensive. After listening to verbal communication, they did not understand they would never be authorized to enter our home if they told the truth or were honest."
"Casey of Kentwood, MI",7/20/2010,,"I have been trying to reach Comcast all day via their toll-free phone numbers and have received an error message or busy signal each time.  On top of that, the past few days, my modem has been losing its IP address roughly six times a day."
"Edward of Grand Rapids, MI",7/20/2010,,"I had been losing my internet connection with increasing frequency over a seven week period. I finally contacted Comcast on 7/15/10. I went through their tedious menu options before reaching a person and one of the last questions asked was whether or not I would be interested in participating in a satisfaction survey at the end of my call. I responded affirmatively and immediately lost my connection and had to re-dial. The rep that I finally spoke with literally oozed indifference. I actually felt like I was imposing on her. I explained the problem and she said the soonest she could have a service person visit was 7/20/10 sometime between 9:30 and 12:30. I reluctantly agreed.After stewing for a bit I called again and spoke to another rep, who again, treated me like an annoyance. I explained that 5 days was a long time to be without service and she said that was the best Comcast could do, take it or leave it. When I described the problem I was having, she suggested I purchase a new modem and try that. I purchased a new modem and went through the byzantine registration process with Comcast only to find that I still didn't have an internet connection. I called back a final time and said that I would wait for the service rep, but expected a discount on my bill. I was given the standard $10.00 off my monthly bill.The service rep arrived shortly after noon on 7/20/10 and, hopefully, repaired the problem. So far, so good. Comcast shares a monopoly with AT&T and both companies stink. They seem to be under the impression that we are still living in 1990 when people didn't rely on their computers daily for everything from airline reservations to bill paying. Your problem is not their problem and the knuckle-dragging, mouth-breathers that they have answering phones remind you of that with every contact. I would love to see the government take over both companies, because they certainly couldn't do any worse."
"Casey of Kentwood, MI",7/20/2010,,"I have been trying to get a hold of Comcast via their phone numbers all day today and I have received a busy signal or a ""cannot complete this call"" error every time."
"Paul of Scituate, MA",7/21/2010,,"This is a copy of the email I sent to Comcast - using their email form.""Upon agreement between myself and the customer representative that there was something wrong with the recording/playback part of the, We set up an appointment for today (Wed - 21 July) to replace the cable box. The tech brought a cable box that was rather beat up and an older model than the one I already have and he suggested I would be better off going to the walk-in station in North Scituate and getting one myself. He didn't offer to come back tomorrow with at least a matching cable box or better than the one being replaced.When I called Comcast after the tech left to explain that I was not satisfied with the way this was being handled, I was told that my service call had been listed as 'Canceled. ' I then asked if I could at least call the walk-in facility in North Scituate to be sure they had a unit available, she said that she couldn't give out that number (and that even she couldn't call this Comcast facility - it was against the rules).Is this the kind of treatment a customer should expect for the $150+ I pay every month for the three services I subscribe to from Comcast.? """
"Jorge of West Jordan, UT",7/21/2010,,I keep calling this company all the time. I cut the service over two months ago because the tech the company send me to install the phone service cut my air antenna to used on the confection. I call and call Comcast to send somebody to repair the damage they do and never send me anyone. That is why I have to cut my phone service with this company. Customer service is poor. They never return my phone calls and now I still getting phone bills. They tell me I still have phone service. We have to do something about this company who robs people. 
"Kaka of Seattle, WA",7/23/2010,,"My boyfriend has Comcast and I live with him for many years. We agreed to disconnect it due to his extenuating circumstances and he does not to deal with it. I went to Comcast store and also called to disconnect. They ignored me simply because I was not on the account. They don't understand that I am member of household and pay the bills including Comcast. They were rude, inconsiderate and horrible customer service. Should I accept that from I company that I paid services for? I also reported that there is no cable services. It went out on me. They even didn't care to take a look at the problem and send a technician. I also returned the cable box to their store. They insisted that they will keep charging for the overpriced cable just because I am not on the account. Can they understand that is no thank you for bad customer service and Comcast disregard for the customer that pays for a service that I am not satisfied with?"
"Stephani of Owings Mills, MD",7/25/2010,,"On June 26, 2010 at 11:00 am, a Comcast Cable employee came to my residence.  It was for a scheduled appointment to pick up my two cable boxes, two remotes, wireless modem, and router due to me canceling my service secondary to moving out of state.  On July 24, 2010, I received a letter in the mail at my new address from Comcast informing me that I never returned my ""modem equipment"" and that I may owe ""$500"".  I called Comcast Cable to find out why this was happening and all they could tell me was to call collections.  I believe that I am being taken advantage of.  My mother was present and helping me move that day and was there at the time of pickup.  She is a witness that the Comcast employer indeed took all of the Comcast equipment.  I am a responsible Comcast customer who has always paid her bills on time and they have been unwilling to help me resolve this issue.  I have not stolen their property and I am hoping by going through this medium that someone can help me resolve this.  "
"Michelle of Randallstown, MD",7/26/2010,,"I have called Comcast for a week to take the cable out of my yard. I am not a customer and the cable is not connected to my home. It is attached to the neighbor's house. I have explained to them that we are trying to obtain a license for this property to move our family daycare. Each day I call, I hold on while they go somewhere. I wait and they come back to tell me they are coming out that day. Sometimes when I have held so long, I am disconnected. My granddaughter comes over and she cannot go and play in her backyard because of that cable."
"David of Westminster, MD",7/26/2010,,"We ordered Comcast Cable last month.  The install date was Saturday, July 24th.  Today is Monday, July 26th.  The tech arrived to our house at 9:00 am.  We had a 7 am to 10 am window of service.  The tech attempted to install the cable service and received error messages on all of the cable boxes.  He told us that he would have to leave and come back with his supervisor.  Prior to leaving, he disconnected our Direct TV service and disconnected all of our satellite boxes.  He left the three cable boxes in various conditions throughout the house - meaning wrappers and remotes and cables were hanging out everywhere.  We waited until 7:00 pm for his return.  He did not return nor did we receive a call from anyone at Comcast.  We started calling Comcast on Sunday and spoke with several call agents.  Each agent was saying, ""We show that you have service and your cable was installed.""  This could not be further from the truth.  As of today, Monday July 26th, we still do not have service and our satellite is disconnected.  However, we are still paying for our satellite.  I hope we will not be billed for cable that we do not have.  We made several calls today to various 800 numbers.  We could not get anyone to see us until Tuesday from 7 am to 10 am.  Now I have to take a vacation day to meet with a tech who may or may not be able to correct the problem."
"Patricia of Richmond, VA",7/27/2010,,"Me and my fiance placed an order with Comcast and 6 times, they did not show. Every time I call to see if they are in fact coming or if they are running late, they have assured me that they would be there. They have my cell number and job, also my fiance's number. I have lost time and pay from my job due to this situation. Well, I have no physical damage. However, I do have (I guess you can say) mental anguish. I am very disappointed and angry about the so-called service I was supposed to receive."
"Tiffani of Naperville, IL",7/28/2010,,"We recently became customers of Comcast. We scheduled installation (it took two weeks to get an appointment). We selected Comcast because we wanted cable, phone and internet. I liked that the plan allowed for caller ID on the TV. The first person came out and caller ID never worked. I called and was told to call back in 3 days. Great, now I have to wait 3 days. It still does not work and I am going through the long wait time to speak to a representative. I wait another week to have a representative come and install a ""new"" box with the proper features. Pardon me, but why did they not install the most up to date, new equipment the first time?Okay, now the ""new"" equipment is installed. The tech said to wait one hour. Well, I waited 3 and it is still not working. I call the call center and speak to Eurika, she runs me through all the checks. All seems to be in working order to them but I'm still not getting the paid service with caller ID. As I inspect the ""new"" equipment I see it is dented, scratched and obviously have been very well used. I call back and am told I should take the equipment to the local Comcast center to exchange it if I don't like it. Oh, and by the way, there will be an installation fee. They ""waived"" the second installation fee. As a reminder, I am a new customer. I have had the service less than 30 days. I would like this reported to the proper agency. I'm sure I'm not the only person they are taking advantage of."
"J of St Paul , MN",7/28/2010,,"The flipping digital box doesn't work. It won't program, and I am sick of the 22 other channels that they let me get. I tried 6 times to call and program the box and all it gives me is channel 1234 of one moment please."
"Jim of Placerville, CA",7/29/2010,,"I have repeated problems with cable TV hookups, equipment replacement and function and internet signal strength (routers). Different stories given by different technicians on-site. They fail to return phone calls. Overall, service is pathetic."
"Yesenia of San Jose , CA",7/29/2010,,"I have been having problems with my phone and cable service.  Iâ€™m not getting a signal.  I scheduled an appointment for 07/26/10 at 4:00 pm-6:00 pm.  The staff showed at 7:00 pm after I took time of my employment to be there at home.  The technical support staff reported, ""I donâ€™t have the cable I need.""  The staff was not prepared to work on my cable issues.  The staff only took less than 15 minutes then asked me to reschedule.  Due to my busy schedule, I cannot have anyone come to complete repairs until 07/31/10.  I am upset that I have been without cable for a week because your staff is not prepared.  I took time off my employment.  I have not had cable for a week."
"Becky of Moundsville, WV",7/30/2010,,"Simply put, there is no such thing as ""high speed"" with regards to Comcast internet service. It does not exist. You can follow any directions, be it from email or on your bill provided by Comcast and it will not increase the speed of your computer. They are nothing but a monopoly whose business and service we are, unfortunately, stuck with. God bless the business that finally comes forth and challenges them. They could offer the same services but charge reasonable prices and would earn a fortune!"
"Richard of Modesto, CA",7/31/2010,,"I ordered and the internet through Comcast with self set up kit. After several weeks it never came, I called customer service and got someone I could barely understand who put me on hold for 15 minutes before I was cut off. I just got a bill for almost $200 for a service I have not only ever used; I never even got the start up kit to install in the first place! I called customer service today and was on hold between 2 different operators for no less than 33 minutes according to my call timers before I spoke to a supervisor. As with the reps the supervisor had limited ability to understand English! This is the worst customer service department I have ever dealt with even the IRS! I canceled my service and went to direct TV which appears to have English speaking reps. My bill was adjusted after almost an hour with these people telling me I have a service I don't Have completely unreal! Very upset with all this out sourcing. Bring our companies back home!"
"Clayton of Atlanta, ga",3/5/2011,,I've tried to cancel my Comcast services and haven't been able to. They either put me on hold or hung up on me after an hour of waiting. They should be punished for their unethical practices regarding cancellation of their services.
"May of Warrenville, IL",3/10/2011,,"For the past 2 years we had been subscribing to Comcast's basic television service. About 4 months ago I decided to upgrade to a Comcast Digital Economy plan. In the plan description I was to get almost every channel, with the exception of HBO, Showtime, etc. About 1 month into service I randomly stopped receiving Nickelodeon, the History Channel, TLC & TBS to name a few. When I called to complain they just said they took away those channels with no real explanation given. I accepted this answer, as it wasn't too big of a deal since we still had On Demand service and my son could watch his Nick shows, etc. Well, just a few weeks ago I realized they have now taken away our On Demand service for these channels since we ""are not subscribers"". Never once was this told to me. I'm tired of them making us pay more and more for less and less services."
"Kathleen of West Berlin, NJ",3/11/2011,,"I had been a Comcast customer for over two years when I moved in December. I wanted to transfer the service to my new home, but was unable to be there for the new installation, so my nephew was there. I wanted the same service I had previously had. Instead, I became a new customer, was charged an activation fee, got a bundle package including a phone number which I cannot use as I have a MagicJack phone and a cell phone. I was told the installation fee at my new home was, I believe, approximately $60.00.The last bill from my previous residence was just under $77.00. The next bill (January) at my new address was over $500.00! I was outraged and didn't pay it as I tried to find out what all the charges were for from several customer service reps. The next bill rolled up to $610.00! Now I am getting messages on my new top-of-the-line TV sets that I need a digital converter! Something else to pay for?Yesterday I paid $550.00 due to a termination notice, even though I have no idea how the bill ever got to that size. I would have really disputed this bill except for the fact that I just had two leg surgeries and a wrist surgery last week. It's hard to fight when you're under the weather. My sister in Florida gets lots of TV channels using only rabbit ears and no cable. You can't do that in NJ because all you get is snow on the screen and I've heard the cable companies have blocked the signals so it's impossible to get free TV. This is a disgrace. I told Comcast I was going to complain about this. How is it nobody at Comcast can explain such a large bill to me? I would need a forensic accountant to be able to figure it out."
"Joe of Mt Prospect, IL",3/14/2011,,"Cable, phone and internet installed last August. The first 30 days are free if your service was not good and it was not. We had 4-5 service orders, not resolved. I cancelled service within the 30 days and continued to get billed for service and labor charges. I called 3-4 times to CS and asked them to remove all charges because we were within 30 days, nothing happened, I gave up. My account is now in collections and has affected my credit score. It's been 7 months and Comcast needs to zero my account and correct all three credit bureaus. Thank you."
"Pam of Maple Falls, WA",3/14/2011,,"I recently called Comcast to discuss downgrading my cable to Extended. I told them it would be temporary. I also informed them that I would like to start using my own modem and router instead of renting one from them. I was told to bring in all of my equipment including the modem that I wished to use instead of Comcast's to my local (**) office. When I did as ask, the service representative first told me that I was misinformed; that no modem worked except for the one Comcast was renting to us. She said it was due to getting my cable TV and DSL through the same modem. I showed her that I had a cable modem; one that I had been assured would suffice, and she again said no, and that I must rent one from Comcast.Then, she picks up my standard DVR off the counter and says that no one is allowed stnd. DVRs any longer and that she had to take it. I said, ""Wait. No, I want to keep it."" She said I had to either pay for an HD DVR or go to a reg. cable box for $8.99 (I pay $ 9.99 for my DVR). I said no way and she ignored me and whished it away to another room.I asked to speak to someone else, and finally, she called up someone who ended up telling her that I could keep my DVR, and he then gave her an authorization code which she entered into my account. But, when she went to retrieve my DVR, she came out with a new one, saying it took less time to enter the information she needed with a new one instead of my old one. I had over 30 hours of recording on it and it was all set up. She also ""lost"" my remote and gave me another one while acting p/o because the supervisor allowed me to keep my DVR.The last straw was when I asked for the one free cable box that comes with the extended basic. She told me that I didn't get a free cable box and that I had to pay for my DVR and also for the cable box. I asked her for the adapter, which Comcast states on their site is free, to allow TVs to get channels 25-75. She said there was no such a device and that my only option was to either pay for both boxes or simply watch only the analog channels on the TV in the living room.Do I have any recourse to force Comcast to provide a free cable box per their own advertising or is this the penalty I have to pay for having stood my ground regarding my DVR? If I am downgrading my cable so I can be a responsible customer and ensure I don't have services I can't pay for, then it follows that I can't afford to be paying for cable boxes and modems that either I already have or that Comcast promises to provide for free. What is up with that?"
"Rhoda-Ann of Miami, FL",3/15/2011,,"On February 17th, I was offered a bundle $39.99 per 12 months no contract plus $75 gift card for 12 meg. internet, free Norton antivirus, phone service with unlimited local and long distance, caller id, call waiting, voicemail, call forwarding and more and I would get to keep my phone number.  Comcast is refusing to honor this bundle that was offered to me and stated that at the time that bundle was not being offered.The results of several attempts to have this corrected have been partial.  I will receive the $39.99 per month for 12 months, no contract, but will not receive the $75 gift card.  It seems to me that Comcast is in the business of misrepresenting the truth to gain customers.  They do not honor their word and deceive consumers.  Something should be done about this. "
"David of Santa Rosa, CA",3/25/2011,,"On 3-15 I placed an order with Comcast to provide me with telephone, internet and TV. I was told the equipment for my order would be at my house by 3-22. On 3-24, I still had not received my equipment. I called Comcast and asked the status. The agent said he would have to talk to his manager. He came back on the line and told me that the person that originally took my order had not released the equipment to ship. He told me as a result of Comcast error, he would ship the equipment overnight and I would have it on 3-25. He gave me a confirmation number and told me that I could track the shipment at Comcast.net.On 3-25 I went online for 20 min. and could not find any way to track my order. I called Comcast and after lots of waiting got a rep who told me that there is no way to track an order on Comcast.net. He transferred me to another department. The rep from the new department told me that the order was not shipped overnight and I would get it in 3-5 business days.I asked to talk to his supervisor who was Monik employee# Semo0610. Monik told me that Comcast did not have any equipment to ship due to their vender delays and that all orders in March had been delayed due to this. I asked Monik why none of the half-dozen Comcast employees I had spoken to had told me this. Instead they all said you will get your components in x-days.Monik could not tell me when the order would be shipped but it would not be before April. She then told me that I would need to go through the order release process all over again because this needed to happen again because the order was delayed. I asked to speak to her superior and was told that there was no person I could talk to and that Comcast managers do not receive or return calls. So right now, I have been lied to a number of times and I have no idea when I will get my equipment. This is not a way to run a company and I will not accept this kind of extremely bad service. I do not know when or if I will have phone service or internet."
"Carol of Sonoma, CA",3/25/2011,,"On March 25, 2011, I was on the phone with them for the past hour and still no resolution has been made - still on hold. I contacted Comcast to complain about a promised rate reduction that was to have taken effect Nov 9, 2010. The promise was for a $40 a month reduction in my bill for a period of 6 months. To date this rate reduction has not taken effect. I've been bounced around on the phone to 3 people now and I'm waiting for a supervisor. I have the entire chat room conversation documenting the promised rate reduction and nothing is being done. To date, I am out $160 as the promised rate reduction has not taken effect."
"Christopher of Houston, TX",3/25/2011,,"I cancelled my account and was due a refund for the account. I gave my new address. I have called 6 times over the last three months, and every time, they tell me that they will cut a new check and give me a new date of two weeks. I still haven't received my money from them.I've spent over 650 minutes of my time and phone bill on them. I have yet to receive the money owed me."
"Michael of Chicago, IL",3/28/2011,,"I have absolutely had it with Comcast. Most recently I had an appointment to have them fixed an issue I reported earlier in the week. The operator I spoke with stated that there were no outages in my area and they had to send out a tech. So I stay home all day Saturday (cancelling plans) to wait. No one shows and when I called, they told me that there was an outage in the area and as such, they cancel their appointments when they fix an outage. Not to mention that they cancelled without a phone call. Also I have an issue with variable pricing. I live in a building with 220+ units and many people pay less or more for like services. Cannot seem to grasp that one!"
"Annette of Jacksonville, FL",3/28/2011,,"My service was previously interrupted and on Thursday 3/24, I paid the total amount and brought my account current. I called Comcast customer service and a representative advised me my cable service would be restored in about 45 minutes. Once I returned from work later that evening and discovered my service was still not connected I immediately called Comcast again and this time was told there must be a splitter in the house that was preventing connection. Explained to the technician nothing was touched in fact everything was as before. He in return set an appointment for Sunday 3/37 between 8am and 11am. I later found out after speaking with about six more representatives, the appointment was actually scheduled for Saturday 3/26 which I was out of town. Comcast representative said there was no need for me to be at home for the technician to restore my service. When I returned late Saturday night, my service was still disconnected.Called Comcast again about 10 pm and the technician kept me on the phone troubleshooting and nothing resolved my problem. What really upset me today was when I spoke to Hector a technical support representative only to find out that someone initiated another visit to my home set for 3/31 without notifying me about the appointment. After explaining to Hector my dilemma and requesting some type of compensation from my inconvenience, he refused and began to sound like a bill collector by telling me I won't receive any credit because the amount I paid was the total amount. Advised Hector this situation can be dealt with at another time so what can be done about getting my cable reconnected. Hector explained that a technician came out to my home for the set appointment and I explained to him this was the incorrect date.But he kept repeating it over and over again ignoring my main issues of how to get my cable back on. I was treated very poorly and disrespectfully. Hector showed no empathy towards my situation but was rude and basically called me a liar and for me this is not acceptable. Please help me get someone's attention because it's evident that Comcast has lost sight of the ""Big Picture."" I also feel the commercial about how the customers come first and even offer a guarantee is bogus because I have received poor customer service from several Comcast representative within the last few days. Please help!"
"Kenneth of Sterling, MI",3/30/2011,,"My name is Kenneth ** and I am the President of a fairly large electrical contracting company that currently resides in Worcester Massachusetts. The name of our company is New Horizons Technologies Inc. The current address of our company is in Worcester, but we have recently purchased a new place of business that is located at ** in Sterling Massachusetts. We closed on this new property on November 19th, 2010. Since purchasing this property, we have completely renovated it, bringing the office space up to date, improving the exterior of the buildings and upgrading all of the utilities, and systems at this location. We have basically taken an old historic former rail station, then Lumber yard and brought it back to life with a new found character and meaning to the town of Sterling and the neighbor hood it is located in. When done we will have spent over Four Hundred Thousand Dollars on this place to make it a modern, functional, thriving place of business.The Town of Sterling has been wonderful to deal with including the Building Departments, Inspectional Services, Fire Department, and local utilities. They have been very accommodating and a pleasure to work with. They understand the value of a company like us moving in and updating a property such as this and what it brings to the community. Us moving into a location like this adds value to all of the real estate around us because of how we increased the value of this property, it helps the other local businesses in the area with increased volume of business because of the 70 employees we bring to the area to do business in that area. We hope to continue to grow and provide opportunity for additional hires from this area to add to our work force.This Recession and current economy have been very hard on small businesses like ours as you very well aware. I have been doing this for over 23 years now and this is by far the worst period I have ever seen. To be honest, I am not even sure our business model even works now with the new set of rules that are out there to compete in this economy, but we are trying our best to survive and to make it to the end of this period. We actually had a decent 2010 so , we decided to invest in property and to stop renting and hopefully 2010 was an indicator of things to come. So we bought the property in Sterling and hoped to make this our new home to take us into the next decade and help with setting us up to be prosperous into the next decade.The purpose for this letter is to inform you, and also ask for your help in dealing with Comcast. We have electricity, we have gas, we have phone service, but we have no internet service. The only player in town is Comcast and our hands are tied. We can only deal with them. We first contacted them on February 28th, one month ago today. We are planning on moving into our new office this Friday April 1st at the close of business on that day and opening for business on Monday April 4th. They are now telling us we will not have internet service for approximately another 3 weeks. We have documented all phone calls and internet dealings with them. They have been totally slow, unresponsive, and non-caring about our situation. Basically treating us like a number and could care less about our situation. I have no idea if there are more complaints, many complaints or no complaints about Comcast and their service, but I feel I needed to write you and every other person in politics and the media who might listen. I have been totally shocked to find out that it takes 6 to 8 weeks to get internet service to a business line ours in the town of Sterling. We deal with municipalities all the time. Getting power, telephone and internet service for our clients. We know the routine, we know the pitfalls and the steps needed, but dealing with Comcast has been the worst. Just totally unresponsive to our needs and time frame.They need to run a cable 700 from where it is currently dead ended on the street. They say that is one of the reasons they cannot do it quickly because they need to schedule that part to get that wire strung on the poles. The other is they say they need a police detail. I tell them that we know what it takes to string a cable 700, and we know what it takes to get a police detail and both can happen very easily with a little bit of effort. They do this every day all day. They prefer to put up barriers instead of removing them. They prefer to stop business instead of helping it.Basically, I read all the time about how politicians talk about providing jobs, helping small business to succeed, to provide an atmosphere where businesses can prosper so they can hire new employees. Everyday I see on the news how it is so important to get America back on its feet, to get people back to work, to buy properties and help out neighbor hoods they are located in. To get the most important segment of our industry hiring again, which is small businesses. Well, here is a perfect situation. We have done everything with out no kick backs or buy outs from the governments, no tax credits and no assistance what so ever. I just need Comcast to give us internet service. They were given this monopoly by our government and now they stand in the way of business progressing. This is just not right. We are not a 100 billion dollar bank, insurance company, or car manufacturer, we are an 8 million dollar a year small business trying to survive.Technology is so very important to our business and every business out there. I keep hearing that the government wants the internet brought to every household in the country. Well, we use it and need it and cannot run with out it. The impact to our business is in the tens of thousands with out it. If the government is going to give these companies a monopoly in these towns, the government needs to apply pressure to these companies when they are not serving the good of the community.Hopefully there is something that can be done here. Business as usual with Comcast needs to stop. Maybe we cannot be helped, but others may be able to be in the future."
"Drew of Lakewood, CO",4/14/2011,,"My dad and I live together and have been subscribing to Comcast for roughly 2 years now. Originally, our service was just fine. No problems. Now, it is the exact opposite. I believe it started in January when the internet would cut out every morning at 2 am. It did this every single morning. I called Comcast to let them know of the trouble and that it was an issue for us, since we would use the internet at that time of the day. The customer support representative said that it was a very simple issue. She said Comcast was sending updates to the router and modem and for whatever reason, the updates weren't making it from the modem to the router. Her suggestion was to simply reset the modem and router every time the Internet cut out. That suggestion seemed a bit non-caring and ridiculous. I shouldn't have to power cycle my equipment every time I want to connect to the internet. Then the disconnections started happening more frequently, especially during the nighttime hours. Every time the Internet would disconnect, the phone service would shut off too. I called Comcast again and complained that we can't use services we are paying for. I told the customer service representative that I was calling from a payphone, since their phone service was too unreliable to carry on a conversation. And all calls would cut out after a minute or two.The representative confirmed that it wasn't a problem with our router, since the phone service doesn't even go through it. The representative also said they would send a technician out to check the modem and the cable line. Then the technician replaced all the line from the pole to the house, replaced some splitters, and replaced our modem. She also found a problem we didn't know we were having. When she connected her device up to our cable line, she said we weren't getting all the TV channels that we were supposed to be getting. We hadn't noticed this, since we don't watch that much TV. After she replaced the equipment, she did another test with her device saying she noticed a drastic improvement but admitted that the signal was still not in proper specs. Since the internet appeared to be working at that moment, she left saying to call Comcast if we had any further issues. Sure enough, the problem came back immediately. The next tech Comcast sent out checked everything, replaced some cable lines inside the house, and left. Nothing he did fixed the problem. Then one of our many TV boxes quit working altogether and wouldn't pick up any stations. Comcast sent a tech to replace that and to try to check on our internet problem. The technician replaced the TV box and got the TV signal working again but wasn't able to do anything for the internet.I called Comcast to complain again. At this point, they offered me 6 months of Showtime for free. That was meaningless to us, since we hardly watch TV and it in no way helps the internet problem. A discount on our bill would have been more appreciated. At this point, Comcast told me they would send out a field tech, since the regular techs couldn't solve the problem, and that he would definitely be able to solve it. The field tech came out and seemed to understand exactly what the problem was but not what was causing it. He decided to rewire the inside yet again. When doing so, he felt voltage running through the line. I felt the lines and sure enough, it was comparable to a strong 9V battery. He immediately said he was done there and that we were causing the problem ourselves. He said our house wasn't properly grounded and that we were feeding voltage back into the system thus causing our own problem. How he was so sure of this, I don't know, since he did not use any devices or equipment to confirm this. We were charged $40 for that tech to come out. After his visit, we had all the outlets properly grounded and tested the ground to make sure it was a good ground and worked properly. It did. Since our internet problems had been progressively getting worse, I called Comcast again. And again, they sent out a technician. This tech appeared to have the best understanding of the problem. After giving him a history of the problem and what had been done thus far, he watched the modem lights and confirmed we had a real and serious problem. He said he would go outside and test the line to see whether or not we ourselves were sending voltage and noise back into the system. That is a test that the field tech should have done but didn't.After he finished his test, he confirmed that our house was not causing any noise and there wasn't any voltage feeding back in the line. He then told us that the problem was being caused by one of our neighbors. He said that one of their houses was creating high voltage and feeding noise into the system. He apologized for the fact that he wouldn't be able to fix it right away and said to give him 2 or 3 days to isolate which house was causing the problem. He gave us a cell number and said to call him directly if we were still having problems after that. Two days later, the problem appeared to be fixed. A couple more days later, the problem came back fully. We called the number several times and left a message but never got any call backs. That was not surprising. I called Comcast, and they said they knew nothing of it and that according to their map, our neighborhood was just fine. This was in contradiction to what the representatives had told me in earlier phone calls. On more than one of my previous calls to them, the customer support representative had checked their area map and said ""yes"" that they can see that there are some service issues in the neighborhood area.So basically depending on who you talk to, they will either admit or deny a neighborhood-wide problem. Eventually the last representative I spoke to apologized and said there was nothing that Comcast could do at all. She did not offer any sort of compensation or any discount on our monthly bill, even though she admitted we weren't getting proper service. I explained that I was thinking of switching to Qwest for internet service, and the representative told me that that would not help. She told me that Qwest uses the same lines and poles and that even if I switched over to them, we would continue to have this same problem. At that point, I decided to wait just a little longer before cancelling services. As of now, we have cancelled our TV and phone service but still subscribe to internet. Our problem still exists. I don't know what to do. Also, in the past week, aside from the random disconnects, our speed has dropped significantly. We are paying for the 20 Mbps service, and as of a few weeks ago, we were getting that with an average of 23 Mbps. Now, the best we can get is 3 Mbps. The slowest speed Comcast offers on their website is 15 Mbps. So something is clearly wrong.I don't know what to do anymore, and I get the distinct impression that Comcast is taking advantage of us and doesn't care as long as we keep paying the bill. Is there no law that requires them to keep their end of the agreement? We can't afford to pay $40 every time we need a tech out here, which is always."
"Victor of Baltimore, MD",4/14/2011,,"I contacted Comcast /Xfinity, to get their triple play service on December 19, 2009. I talked to Alesia ** and she set up for a pre-post for Sunday January 3, 2010. The tech came out said he needed to get to the basement of the apartment building I was moving into. We set for someone to comeback on the following Thursday, the 7 of January. That tech said the basement was flooded. He said he would need to put in for a construction permit to dig a trench from the apartment to the end of the building. I found out they were subcontractors for Comcast, this was on January 21, they did not notify Comcast. I called Comcast that day and told them what their subcontractor told me. I then told them I needed my Internet by the 1st of February. They could not guaranty it, so I told them I'll vet phone and Internet from someone else until they could get me hooked up.Every month, I'd receive a call from Comcast saying they were sending someone out to book me up, no show. That continued for months. A costumer service rep. named Bob contacted me to set up for a tech to vet me hooked up. That was in July of 2010. In August, a tech came out and split service of the apartment from above me just temporary, supposedly, so I would have the triple play. The phone and TV worked well, but my high speed Internet was slow and would kick me off line within minutes to no more then an hour of being online. I called Comcast letting them know I was having problems with the Internet. I thought it was the Norton Security was doing it. I forgot my hook up was split from another apartment. Weak signal or weak stream coming into the apartment plus split 3 ways to go to 3 TVs. I called Comcast Sunday, the 3 of April 2011. They set up for a tech to come out Tuesday the 5th of April 2011.I showed him the so called temporary hook up and let him do his test on my computer and he checked the dream/signal from the split outside of the apartment and said they need to do the pre-post to get me the proper stream/signal to come into the apartment. I was told it won't be done overnight. He seen from prior paperwork that the prepost was originally scheduled in July of 2010. He then called Comcast and put in for the proper prepost again to be done. I had to call Comcast every time I got on my computer to try to see what could be done about my lack of Internet stability and why was I still being charged for a service. I've been billed for and not receiving. I was then told they would credit me for a month that I first said it was due to Comcast not having me hooked up properly. And that I had to wait for them to solve the problem before they could credit me. Ever since I called them, my Internet service is getting worse. I've done drugging they told me to do from deleting the cookies, cache, to resetting the box to doing Norton massive computer clean up of spy and adware scans, which showed there were no viruses. I was calling a lot since the 3 of April. They say it will be 2 weeks before a date for them to get come to do the digging of the trench for the prepost will be set and don't know how long it can take for that date to actually take place. I now have an even harder time to vet on line and stay than I did prior to me having complain and the tech come out to let them know what the problem was. This is the reason why I am putting in a complaint on Comcast/ Xfinity."
"Alisyn of Sacramento, ca",5/3/2011,,"My Internet stopped working.  My husband called customer ""no"" service to get some help, but the guy couldn't help.  So, my husband requested a tech come out to our house to take a look at it.  After much arguing, the tech finally scheduled the appointment for 5/3/11 between 8-10 am.  My husband requested the day off and we received automated calls and emails reminding us of the appointment.  We confirmed with the automated phone call that we did want to keep our scheduled appointment.  On 5/3/11, at 7:59 am, my cell phone rings.  My husband went outside to see if the tech was out front to let him know we were home, but no one was there.  I check my voicemail, it says, ""This is Comcast calling regarding your appointment, call to reschedule.""  What?I called right back and was on the phone with a rep.  I was told that I had to reschedule since I didn't pick up the phone.  It was 8:06 am.  Really?  Wow!  We were livid!  I asked to speak with a supervisor and was put on hold for 10 minutes.  And then the same rep came back on the phone.  She never got a supervisor and just repeated what she had said prior.  I asked to be transferred to a supervisor again and she blind transferred the call to another rep, not a supervisor.  I had to repeat everything I had already discussed with the previous rep.  So, after much arguing, I was finally transferred to a supervisor (it was after 9 am by this point, one hour into the phone call) who stated that my appointment wasn't cancelled and they would still be there by 10 am.  10:30 am hits, still no call, and no tech at my house.I called again and spoke with Surel who stated that the appointment had been cancelled.  What?  I was done!  I asked him to cancel my service.  I don't pay over $70 a month for Internet service just to be treated like this.  So he put me through to Bobby.  Bobby was very apologetic and friendly and even understanding.  He offered me an appointment for the same day from 2-4 pm and a $20 credit and $15 off my bill for the next 12 months.  I told him that was fine, but I was going to talk to my husband about still cancelling, and he understood.Well, so far, it is 3:58 pm and no call.  I guess we got cancelled again without us knowing.  My phone hasn't rang once, so they have two minutes to give me a call or they are going to get dropped.  I can pay $70 to someone who needs it and will value me as a customer.  Poor customer service.  Do not use them, they are awful!"
"Natalia of Deerfield Beach , FL",5/4/2011,,"I have spent countless months working to get a resolution to the issue at hand repeatedly explaining the situation and all I receive in return is apologies. Then, I'm given assurance that everything will be taken care of and resolved. It has been nearly 2 years and I have yet to hear back from anyone regarding my TV service being down for as far as I can remember.It is completely unsatisfactory for the way my account has been handled and no follow up has yet to be made on your part regarding corrections and getting the job done right in fixing a consistent TV issue that is apparently non-stop for the past 2 years. I have spoken with Sara ** at the presidential complaints department. After making the complaint, she stated someone is to call me by end of day. Please note that our conversation took place on 5/2/11 at 10:54 am. As of today 5/4/11 at 8:38am, I have yet to get a call regarding my complaint.There seems to be no accountability whatsoever and the kind of service I have been receiving speaks volumes on Comcast's disorganization and disrespect for their customers. The presiding issue and/or combination thereof, is aggravating, unsettling and infuriating. I expect that some action will be taken to overcome this disappointing experience and improve your practices to reflect more positively on a residential and small home business with such prominence as Comcast currently maintains."
"Kurt of Ft. Myers, FL",5/4/2011,,"Roaches! Do not accept a refurbished or used cable box. We lived in our new house for several months and had never seen a roach. Then, after installing a refurbished Comcast cable box, we saw a roach run across the screen. On the next day, one was found beneath the entertainment center! I disconnected the box and took it outside. I called and demanded a new and not refurbished box. When it arrived, I installed it and have not seen another roach for six months. Do not accept a used cable box that has been in someone's roach-infested house!"
"Susan of E. Palo alto, ca",5/6/2011,,"The installation technician was argumentative, and never completed any paperwork or installation other than hanging a cable outside a window for temporary service. Why can't our complaints register with any of these providers and make a difference? Why do we have to complain and complain and complain to someone who doesn't seem to make things change?"
"Iris of Washington, DC",5/8/2011,,"In November of 2010, I noticed that my TV was cutting on and off every Sunday morning between 8 am - 11 am, and only for the channels 290 (TBN) and 33 (ION). At the time of these incidences, a white Comcast van is seek skulking through our alleyway at about 5 mph. I am a minister and enjoy the religious broadcast channels. Comcast insisted that the TV was the problem, and I knew that it was not. A subject matter expert indicated that the TV was frozen in standby mode.Comcast sent over two incompetent ** who looked to be no more than 14 years old. They brought a replacement box but refused to install it. After many shouting matches with these ** and spending four hours at one time on a chat line with someone who can neither read or speak English, they sent over a very good technician who fixed the problem. Well, it was short lived, 3 weeks. The same white Comcast van that was skulking by my apartment, stopping and looking in my apartment, showed up and my TV was rendered inoperable.An error message appeared on my cable box: ""Remove TBN"" and the TV was shut down. What these ** did was to program the Xfinity remote control with codes from the old defunct Comcast remote control device. This proves to me I have an enemy at Comcast, and it is highly probable an ex-boyfriend is the caveat behind working with an employee to get back at me for termination of an abusive relationship. This man has been stalking me for 7 years. Comcast is an evil, ruthless empire. Since they refuse to fix the problem they created, I wanted to disconnect my cable service. What idiot would pay for services they cannot use? Therefore, I am filing a complaint with the FCC. I had dangerously high blood pressure. I was so upset that my left eye is permanently drooped down due to the high blood pressure."
"Tony of Sycamore, IL",5/10/2011,,"I subscribe to Comcast cable internet. I do not want to receive emails promoting their programing or packages. For the last year I have tried to get them to stop sending the unwanted emails. I call, email and opt out usually every other month when the emails start. My last complaint, they suggested that I set up an email filter to block their unwanted email. I was even given instructions.In the past, I told them I no longer wish to use their email, and asked them to lower my internet bill. They thought I was joking. My history with Comcast is not good. When I moved, it took almost 10 hrs on the phone to get my service right. They tried to charge me for my modem, they claimed it was theirs. I tried the digital cable. I had to take the digital box back because I was sent letters threatening to raise my rates if I didn't sign a paper that I assumed I'II had already signed when I got the box."
"Michael of Orlando, FL",5/14/2011,,"I am currently involved in a battle with Comcast over the restoration of my service. All of my services have been unavailable for over 36 hours at the time of this writing (from a neighbor's Bright House connection). I have made three separate calls to their customer service line, and each time the main customer service center is blaming this on the dispatch center. They continue to push notes to the dispatchers saying that this is urgent 24-hour-SLA service because I have no dial tone, but I've heard or seen nothing further. Yet I'm told I'm not allowed to know anything about the dispatchers, name, address, phone number. All I can do is complain to the service center management who ""promise"" to get on the issue with the managers of the dispatch center. I'm pretty much at the end of what I can do, short of cancelling my service, which is the next step.The real story here is that I came to Central Florida from Pennsylvania, the home of Comcast. Up there, they treat customers far better than they do down here. My concern is that this company is making inroads in the state of Florida (due to the Adelphia acquisition) yet abuses its customers here in many different ways, from Internet service data caps to not having enough service personnel contracted and available to resolve situations effectively. Even for routine service installations, they have been averaging 5-7 days from what I've dealt with down here, much longer than Bright House or other service providers, and way longer than the 1-2 days back in PA. I feel that Comcast should never have been allowed to operate in the state of Florida to begin with and should not be allowed to expand further without significant improvements to its systems and processes. Furthermore, HOAs and municipalities should be alerted to the issues that this company brings with it and the perils of negotiating with Comcast for service should be made known to them.I intend to bring this issue to representatives, both in Tallahassee and DC, in the hopes that if this company is to continue to be permitted to operate in this state, that it shape itself up to what it ought to be."
"Robert of Memphis, TN",5/20/2011,,"Three years ago (2008), an ice storm broke the TV cable support loose at each end between my house and the pole, allowing the cable to lie on the ground.  Signals were still good so I didn't report it.  A year or more later (2009), Comcast called trying to sell additional services.  I asked the salesperson to report the cable problem to the proper department.  She said she would be happy to do so.  Apparently, she didn't because no one ever came out to re-tie it.  On Sunday, May 15 (2011), all Comcast cable channels suddenly became so snowy looking that we could no longer view pictures.  On Monday, at 2:30 pm, May 16, 2011, I reported the problem to Comcast and received a repair ticket number and service restore time of 24 hours.  On Tuesday, at 3:00 pm, May 17, 2011, I called for status.   ""Charles"", the man who answered, had difficulty finding the account.  He wanted to know how long we had the account.  I replied 35 years at this address.  I advised him the repair number that was assigned and he found it closed out.  There was no report as to why.  He promised to have the problem checked by outside cable repairmen with an ETA of repair 3 to 5 working days.  No ticket number will be assigned, because that department will give the report to the first available technician and there is no way they can estimate when that would happen.  On Wednesday, at 2:00 pm, May 18, 2011, my wife called repair to advise that we were without service and to try to speed the repairs.  She was told the same thing, that it would be reported to the first available technician in a 3 to 5 day time period.  On Thursday, at 8 pm, May 19, 2011, there was no sign of repairmen.  Thereâ€™s still no TV picture.  On Friday, at 4:40 pm, May 20, 2011, there are no repairs yet and thereâ€™s still no picture.       "
"Iris of Washington, DC",5/24/2011,,"Once again, Comcast has tampered with my service by rendering the remote Xfinity device frozen so that the TV is inoperable.  I can't even turn it on manually.  I called the government office of Cable Television.  I got no help.  I have now sent a letter to the mayor, as I am desperate for help.  Their excuse for banishment is that they are in ""discussions"" about which TV shows they deem ""appropriate"" for me to watch, and if it is ""acceptable"" to ""allow me to watch TBN"".  And yet, they have the unmitigated gall to demand payment and threaten to terminate my phone service to the ability I can't call 911 in case of an emergency.  I need an attorney pro bono."
"Joseph of Memphis, tn",5/27/2011,,"Last summer I installed a Comcast internet and television system at my home. The first technician came out and strung wire and put in a modem box with a splitter for the TV. The system worked for about a week and then we started losing the signal. I called them back and the tech said we needed a power booster, so we did that, it worked for a while then trouble again and another technician ran new wires from pole to house, said I didn't need the power booster and fixed it for a while then same issue no service. Comcast has a communications system that's partially automated that will dump you if your number appears to have issues assigned to it or one minute you will be chatting with someone in Knoxville and the next in Mississippi they call it "" call sharing "" I call it caller dumping. I have spent more than 40 hours chatting with all kinds of customer service people and have been told conflicting information by all of them.Later in the year they brought me a new modem but failed to register it as I was talking with joy in Nashville she said the modem was not on file so we added it. Two days later I chatted with Melissa in Nashville and she said it was not on file so we put it on again. I wanted to speak to a supervisor on Thursday May 19th and I chatted with Ryan in Knoxville, he promised that a technical supervisor from Memphis would call me and Iâ€™m still waiting.On Monday May 23 after a good chat with Carla in Memphis she sent out a technician and the Germantown Collierville technical supervisor Carolyn ** who did a fine job trying to fix my issue. She even followed up the next day to try and fix the issue. The afternoon after she and the tech left I could not log on so the new box the 3rd one in a year would not let me on I talked with tech support which is in the Philippines three different times and finally got back on Tuesday May 24th.On Tuesday evening finally totally fed up with Comcast I ordered an ATT DSL internet system and it arrived the next day and I hooked it up and it has not faltered at all. On 5-26-11, I contacted the corporate office in Pennsylvania and chatted with a staffer who said someone from the local office would be calling me and that hasn't happened either. I have heard every false bit of misinformation one can hear from Comcast."
"Iris of Washington, DC",5/28/2011,,"The nightmare continues with Comcast as they are totally incompetent and insensitive with respect to my problem. They will not address the route of the problem which could be a line issue and a power surge which causes the TV to revert to standby mode or there is a virus in the remote. Two weeks ago, a very adept technician was able to fix this problem over the [hone in 8 minutes. Two weeks later, the TV is frozen again which is very much like a computer when it freezes when a sociopath introduces a virus into your computer. I asked for a technician to come to my home to re-program the remote device and he comes over while I am not at home, not honoring the time agreed upon, removes a brand new perfect cable box and replaces it with an old refurbished box that smells as if it has been immersed in a pan of fried pork chops. I would not be surprised if the thing wasn't a roach motel. It looks and smells like it was pulled from the garbage. I have been without a TV for 2 weeks and these people have the unmitigated gall to expect me to pay for services I can't use? If I will try to downgrade, they refuse and say that they are not skilled that area. Why answer the confounded phone if you are not skilled? And then, they switched the contact phone number on my account and start to call my cell phone every 0.2 microns of a second reminding me about my technical appointment. When I call them back and beg them not to call the cell phone because I have to be the one who pays for the call, they assure me that itâ€™s taken cared of and lo and behold, they call again. Then they would tell me that they have no record of an account for me and that I am someone else! I think that it would be pretty hard for me to become a man in 24 hours unless I have the ability to wave a wand and make it so! I honestly feel that with so many dissatisfied customers and the abusive way Comcast handles the populace, we need to band together, facilitate a petition and either replace the entire corporation with seasoned, competent professionals or have some venture capital association, buy Comcast out and run it like a professional organization or offer residents in America the extra options for cable choosing. I live in DC and Comcast is our only option. If enough people start petitioning and demanding change, maybe it would wake the corporation up and stop treating us like the baboons on the planet of the apes treated in Charleston Heston. I wonder how Comcast employees would feel if they were the recipients of such maltreatment."
"Debra of West Palm Beach, FL",5/29/2011,,"It was Superbowl weekend and suddenly at 3 p.m., Friday, I had only static. At first, I was not concerned as my account was up to date. At 5 p.m., I called some 800 number to see if there was a problem in the area. I was advised that it appeared that my area/building did have some problem but since I was the 1st call, a technician could not be called to investigate until 3 calls had been received. To try to shorten the saga, after two more calls, 9 p.m. and 12 a.m. by me, I was assured that a technician would have the problem repaired by 3 p.m. Saturday. The 3 p.m. came and went, still no cable. I did remember something odd on my door when I took my dog out Friday evening about some special Comcast was having with a name and number.When I called on Saturday afternoon, the representative was extremely rude telling me that my account was past due and my service had been shut off. I admit that when I paid my last bill, it may have been a few days after the due date but there was no service interruption or notice of any kind. I also had not yet received the next monthâ€™s bill as yet so I was up to date. Sunday a.m., I fished out that flyer that was on my door and called the guy. I left a message on his machine with the story of his flyer and suddenly, no service. Guess what? Monday a.m., this guy calls me at 8 p.m. that says he disconnected me by mistake and my service now was already working again. No apology from them. The rude customer service representative who by the way, said that the 1st appointment to get that service back would be Thursday. So letâ€™s see. I had no cable from Friday, 3 p.m. until Monday, 8 a.m. I missed superbowl and had I not remembered the flyer in the garbage, I would have had no internet/cable for about a week."
"Namita of Hayward, ca",6/1/2011,,"I had a business account with Comcast. I sold my business on March 28th and I called Comcast and terminated the service in January. I started receiving phone calls from Comcast in April that there is a balance owed on the account. The first call I received was the end of April. When the representative told me there was a balance owed, I got ready to give him my credit card info for the payment. In the middle of the transaction, he mentioned that he apologizes for the call and there is no payment owed on the account. He looked through the records and saw it in the notes that the balance to date has been paid. I was glad that they figured it out and end of conversation. I received another call the very next day from another representative and he said the same thing that there was a balance owed on the account. I told him at the time that I spoke with someone the day before and at the end of our conversation I was told that there isn't any balance owed. I asked the second representative to read through the notes before we go any further. At the end he told me the same thing. He apologized for the phone call and said there was no balance owed. I offered to do a payment anyway and if there is a reimbursement, I'd rather wait for that rather than get something reported on my credit report. The representative assured me that won't happen and clearly everything is documented on my account history. I also told him that I didn't appreciate the phone calls and he said I will receive one more phone call because of the automatic system they have and I could just ignore the call. I didn't receive any call after that. On May 31st, I received a message on my phone that I have a charge on my credit through a collection agency. I called the collection agency right away to find out what the charge was. It was a charge off from Comcast for the same issue. I know the collection agency could only take the payment and I had to resolve this matter with Comcast, so I gave my credit card information to ER Solutions and paid the settlement. The representative asked me to call 14 days later to receive a debt release letter. Today, June 1st, I called Comcast to talk to someone about the misinformation I was given. I was on the phone for 40 minutes and spoke with 2 representatives. The first representative (Stan) told me that even if I cancel my contract, it takes 60 days before the cancellation; so I still owe for the months I didn't have service. I told him that that was not the issue; the issue is the misinformation I was given and the fact that this will be reported to my credit. Stan transferred my call to another department and I then spoke with Larry. Larry told me that I have to talk to the collection agency regarding this matter. I insisted on speaking with the manager. The manager related the message through Larry that they clearly see there was an error. The business contract with Comcast was supposed to be terminated January 19th but the clerk entered the wrong date of April 18th. Therefore, they kept billing me and all the charges accrued on this closed account. At the end of our conversation Larry told me that this will be taken care of by the end of business date tomorrow and now I have to wait 30 days for a refund from the charge I paid to the collection agency.I work full time and I pay my bills on time. I work very hard to maintain good standing on my credit. I sold my business in March and I'm still dealing with Comcast on an account that was supposed to be closed in January when it's June now. They told me that this would not be reflected on my credit but because they have consistently misinformed me, I don't trust what they tell me anymore. They have harassed me with phone calls and had me on the phone repeating myself over and over explaining what had happened. Clearly Comcast does not care for their customers. The result out of this whole situation is that they made a bad reflection on my credit rating. I would ask Consumer Affairs to look into Comcastâ€™s complaint ratings and how efficient they are processing they're customers requests. They clearly need training to process the transactions efficiently and accurately. I spoke with over five representatives and they all assured to correct their mistakes but they haven't so far. I will be contacting them again to make sure they resolve this issue."
"Angela of Goose Creek, SC",6/2/2011,,"Comcast has switched all their channels to digital which is what the government said they had to do, no more analog. With Comcast you have packages that you can choose from. I have a $63.00 package to my home. They did not issue me credit when they moved channels to digital and now that they have finished their transition I do not have service to one of my TVs. Comcast now requires you to have a DTA box on your TV in order for you to receive the channels you already pay for. But they only allow you to have three free boxes; each additional box is $1.99 a month added to your bill. I pay for a service to my home not to each individual TV and I am not getting it on one of my TVs. When I call them they want to tell you about all the different channels that you are now getting with these boxes. And that they really can't give me the other box for free and I would have to pay for it. I didn't ask for more channels. I asked for the service that I am paying for and now not getting because they want to charge me for the additional box. At the moment, I pay for service to my home and I am not getting it. Their customer service and some supervisors will tell you that they do not have a code for issuing a fourth box for free, but that they could give it to me for free for 6 months and from another supervisor for 12 months. I am not getting the service that I am paying for because I do not have the fourth box. And I don't need to pay them $1.99 more a month for service that I am already paying for. I am paying for service that I am not getting because Comcast said I needed to pay them for an additional box. I pay for the service to my home not to each TV."
"Christine of Pittsburgh, PA",6/7/2011,,"I had cable internet reinstalled. I had my own new modem, a Motorola. Serial numbers: 06H7GVXDF355, 128103425705795102010000. HFC MAC ID: 0011AEC8D38A. Model number: SB5100. They installed their own modem without my knowledge and took my modem. I made at least a dozen phone calls regarding this matter and never got return phone calls except once which in turn they left a return phone number that was unreachable for incoming calls. They sent me via US Mail a modem that is a Motorola but not my original one. The one they sent was used and an older model. The modem that is missing is valued at $100 and I would like a check for $100 or a $100 credit to my bill."
"Cynthia of Silver Spring, MD",6/9/2011,,"Once I started my Comcast account, I was promised a 100 dollar rebate back if I would deposit a 100 dollars. I spoke to a Justin ** on 6/6/11. He told me I would get my 100 dollars back by the week's end. When I called the company today, I was told there was no rebate check for me and they treated me very rude. When I said I would reach out to someone else to get my rebate, they simply said go ahead. I hope that you all can help me get my 100 dollar rebate from them. I was unable to have my co-payment and therefore is unable to get my hospital appointment and treatment. My co-payment is $75.00. I was depending on my rebate check to cover my co-payment. Now, I don't have it."
"Tom of Orlando, FL",6/13/2011,,"On 6-4-2011 two Comcast service technicians came into my home without an adult present. My son, who turned 13, in Jan. 2011 and my daughter who is 10 were there alone. They said it will only take 5 minutes to complete work and they were there for 20 minutes according to my son. Technicians also went into rooms without TVs and left jewelry box open and scared my daughter who was in her room by herself. They had no reason to go into her room. Upon leaving they told my son to sign work completed form and left time out line blank. It clearly states that an adult must be present. My son was given no time at all to read paper and was just told to sign. This is a violation of my privacy rights and I fully intend to pursue this matter legally and want to go thru proper channels before I contact a civil attorney on Friday. I have related paperwork and have left a verbal complaint with a Comcast employee over the phone who's name is Ray and have no had any sort of call back or explanation to this matter."
"William of Woodbine, NJ",6/14/2011,,"Comcast prices are way too high. Their programing is filled with repeats. I don't think I should be paying so much money for this kind of service. I would like to see more cable companies, so I could have more to choose from. I also would like to be able to choose the program's I want."
"Jon-Paul of Middletown, NJ",6/21/2011,,"Comcast is upgrading their network to provide consumers a better experience. This upgrade will cost consumers an additional $7/month. While I am not sure of the details of the upgrade, I suspect that the upgrade will benefit Comcast by enabling compression or other bandwidth savings, or provide better management or some other angle that directly benefits Comcast. This is the second 'upgrade' they performed that wound up costing consumers more. The first one was when they changed the signaling inside consumerâ€™s homes. Before they did that, I was able to receive HDTV signals on any of my sets, and I didn't need a set-top box. After the upgrade, a set-top box is required (at a monthly cost). Which branch of government is responsible for allowing these large monopolies to continue to raise prices like this?"
"Gerry of Levittown, PA",6/21/2011,,"Account was cancelled. 4/13/11, modem was removed and additional line basic. 4/18/11, in person I cancelled my account and returned all equipment at office on Trenton Rd and I asked if I needed to do anything else and they replied no. I also have a receipt of returned equipment on this date. My bills have been paid on time, therefore leaving me with a credit of $66.35. I was told I would receive a check in 4 to 6 weeks. Instead on 5/21/11, all I received was their statement showing my credit balance with the same information as stated above. I called around 5/25 and told them I did not yet receive my refund, they said probably by the second week in June. Today is 6/20/11 and when I spoke to the representative, she said I have a zero balance, I stated no! I have a credit balance, she then explained she had to go to the ledger and this did show my credit balance and also stated refund is done 6 to 8 weeks after the repair disconnected me from pole. This repair man did not come to my home until over 1 1/2 weeks after I already had Verizon install service. They did disconnect because I had underground wiring to do. I still can not get an answer to when I will receive my refund. I am wondering what they would do if people did not pay them? Can anyone help me get this refund because as of my last conversation with Clara from Comcast on 6/20 at 7:16, all she could tell me is 6 to 8 weeks, but from what date this would take place she did not know. She did inform me that if I did not receive my refund by 6/30 to call back again and they will put in a request for payment. How many times do I have to call and what else can I do to get my overpayment back. No physical damage just plain old aggravation on getting money that is due me by Comcast."
"Richard of Miami, fl",6/23/2011,,"Comcast's Internet services has the worst customer service I have ever dealt with.  It all started 3 weeks ago when a contractor doing work at my neighbor's house (where the Comcast utility box is located) cut the DSL line which goes from the Comcast box to my house.  Since then, I have spoken to Comcast's customer service department over 15 times.  They have sent out 7 different technicians and I still have the same problem.  Their cable line has not been buried and has run over my fence and through my deck. The latest situation happened earlier this week.  We had an appointment for a ""line crew"" to come out and bury the line on Tuesday, 6/21.  O crew showed up on Monday, took a look at the problem and said that they would return on Tuesday, 6/21, to do the actual work.  I called Comcast on 6/21 at noon, 5:30pm and 8:00pm as nobody from Comcast showed up or called.I was told on all 3 calls that I had an open ticket and that a tech would be at my home by 9pm.  When nobody showed up, I called Comcast again at 9:30pm and was told my appointment was rescheduled for Wednesday, 6/22.  My wife took another day off from work on Wednesday.  We called Comcast at 12:30pm, 5:15pm and 7:30pm and we were told that a tech would be arriving by 9pm.  I called back at 9:30pm when nobody from Comcast showed up and was told that the tech called my cell phone at 7:00pm to reschedule for today, 6/23.Of course, this was totally false, a lie.  When I pointed out that I called after 7:00pm, was told I had an ""open ticket,"" and that a tech would be out by 9pm, the customer service rep apologized and did not have any further information for me except that they would be out today between 9am-9pm.  He also said his ""supervisor"" would call me (last night) with an explanation.  Of course, nobody called last night. Today, I spoke with a supervisor of the department, which is supposed to come out to my house for the job.  He had no explanation and said that it appears the job has been rescheduled for tomorrow, 6/24.  When I complained ""loud enough,"" he said he would have someone come out today.  They are supposed to call me prior to coming; however, I won't hold my breath.  Unfortunately, I don't have any other DSL options where I live or I would have switched providers a long time ago.  If you are considering ordering Comcast Internet services, do yourself a favor and don't do it!  They are horrible."
"Robert of Port norris, nj",6/23/2011,,"On multiple occasions, I have called Comcast, CSRs, and talked to technicians to request them to disconnect my television service because I no longer want their services.  I have been told multiple times by their CSRs via telephone that they apologize and will credit my account and have the service disconnected.  I have yet to see this.On March 26, 2011, after contacting Comcast (3 times) to repair my line, a technician finally came to my home on March 27, 2011.  After the tech completed his work, I asked him to notate on his paper work that I'd like my television disconnected.  He said ""no problem.""  On March 28, 2011, a Comcast truck came to my home and was doing something to the line to my home.  Since this date and prior conversations with Comcast, they are still billing me for TV services. I have also contacted Comcast for a mailing address so I can formally write them a letter regarding this issue and they refuse to supply me with an address.  I refuse to keep calling Comcast for this same issue.  I have a full time job and I cannot stop daily or multiple times a day to call Comcast about this issue just to hear how sorry they are and what they aren't going to do to resolve the issue."
"John of Antioch, CA",6/24/2011,,"In April of this year, we saw a Comcast ad on television for Internet 2Go for $19.99 a month for six months. So I went online to order it. I was told that we would have to pay $40 a month, that the $19.99 deal wasn't available to us, I reluctantly agreed, stating as long as it was only $40 a month, the service rep said it would be, and proceeded setting it up. There was no mention of any roaming charges that came with the deal. My bill, before I ordered this service, was around $145 a month for cable, internet and the un-returned equipment charges they have been doing for over 5 years. When the May bill arrived, it was $260 plus a $60 roaming charge. I payed it. My June bill is $334, $110 roaming charge. I terminated the service, today June 24.I have been paying the different amounts of the un-returned equipment charges for over five years if not longer. My wife is on SSI, and can't afford to pay these high prices for basic cable, digital converter and remote and internet."
"Geraldine of Levittown, PA",6/24/2011,,"I tried to get back my refund and finally, I did receive my refund exactly 68 days after cancelling my account, which is over 9 weeks. It was canceled on 4/18 as shown on my bill and I received the check on 6/24/11. I finally can consider the problem to be resolved."
"John of Bonita Springs, FL",6/29/2011,,"Our Home Owners Association was informed by Comcast that we must convert all of our TVs with ""digital adapters"" effective late June. Comcast provided ""conversion kits"" with ""DTA boxes"" and channel changers for each of three TVs. As an engineer and past owner/manager of a handyman business, I am reasonably technical but the Comcast TV Conversion Kits are nothing more than Comcast's best attempt to control, convert and force customers to upgrade their systems/services so that Comcast can make more money. The installation process is anything but simple and requires numerous ""program codes"" for each TV and TV channel changer. The old analog system was much simpler and more reliable. I guess we didn't learn our lesson from the auto industry, keep it simple, reliable and cost effective or customers will go elsewhere!"
"Stephen of Bonita Springs, FL",6/29/2011,,"Comcast has just gone all digital in my area and thus, forcing you to rent descrambling boxes for any channel above 15. Regardless of how much the rental for this is, this is by far the largest cash cow invented by Comcast. Once Comcast's initial cost of the devices is recovered, everything will be almost pure profit outside of replacing the old defective unit.  If that ain't a cash cow, I don't know what it is. I'm glad I switched to Satellite years ago. "
"Arnold of Chicago, IL",6/30/2011,,"Comcast called and offered to upgrade our existing internet at no extra cost. When the technician arrived, we were told that we were required to purchase Cable TV to obtain the upgrade or else the cost would be raised from $59.95 to $69.95. We refused, and the new Internet was installed, under protest, but we soon discovered it did not work. We phoned Comcast and pursued the problem for 6 hours until a new appointment was scheduled. The next technician arrived late and did not know how to fix the problem. He called another technician who removed the new equipment and attempted to install the older model. He ran out of time and so another appointment was scheduled. Comcast failed to keep that appointment. The internet still does not work and we are again calling Comcast to no avail. "
"Lynn of Sonora, CA",6/30/2011,,"Outside contractor for Comcast was redoing lines in Sonora, CA on Golden Street on June 24th. My neighbor saw them catch their basket on my phone line and they ripped it right out off of my house. They left no note or anything. What a surprise to come home on Friday from work and find my phone not working and then having to waste my Saturday waiting for AT&T to re-string my wire. No consideration for anyone. They were lucky I did not have to work the next day or they would be paying me for my time lost."
"Michael, of Oak Brook, IL",6/30/2011,,"I am being charged for a service call that I believe should be a Comcast expense. Upon adding a TV and additional DVR receiver to an upstairs bedroom, I was not able to receive reception on most channels both cable and other. A service technician was sent to my home and diagnosed the problem as insufficient cable power coming in to my home. He worked on the cable line outside my home and I was told that he added a temporary power cable to the outside box. He did not make any adjustments in the house. When I discovered the charge to my account for this service call, I contacted Comcast and was told that I have to pay for it. The customer service person then told me that the service technician had also told them that I should not be charged for this call but they were billing me anyhow. This complaint does not even address the three trips I had to make to a service center to get the correct equipment for the TV to start with. This is extremely poor customer relations to a long-standing customer. "
"Lawrence of Raleigh, NC",6/30/2011,,"We recently moved out of Maryland to a new state. When we turned in our cable boxes/converters/remotes, we discovered that one digital convert had inadvertently been packed by the movers with our household goods. To make matters worse, the converter was on a small television in our finished basement, and since we are renting for six months while we sell our house in MD and buy a new home, that piece of equipment is located in one of about 200 boxes in long-term storage. We explained the situation to the Comcast rep who told us that we had 60 days to return it or we would be billed $50. Sign, another unforeseen moving expenditure. We asked the rep whether we should pay right then or wait for the bill and she said Comcast would send a bill.Less than 30 days later, Comcast did indeed send us a bill for $50 to cover the (still) missing digital converter. The bill was dated June 7th and had a due date of June 28th. It was forwarded from our home address but we received it on June 13th. My wife wrote a check and sent the payment into Comcast. Yesterday (June 29th) we received a letter from a collection agency for the $50 payment even though our bank shows that Comcast cashed our check on June 23rd. My wife called Comcast this morning and asked to speak with a manager. Comcast received the $50 payment on 6/23/2011. The bill from Comcast wasn't due until 6/28/2011. The letter from the collection agency was dated 6/23/2011. After being on the phone with Comcast for over 1/2 hour asking for a manager, she was transferred to Tracy (team lead), who claimed she was the person in charge. After explaining about the collection letter, Tracy said to my wife that Comcast ""sends the bill to the customer and notifies the collection agency the same day"".  Even though the Comcast bill to the customer has a due date of three weeks later. Excuse me? Comcast notifies a collection agency ""the same day"" that the bill is sent to the consumer? This constitutes consumer credit fraud by (falsely) claiming non-payment on a bill the consumer has not even received yet. "
"Michael of League City, TX",7/2/2011,,"We were transferring our service to our new home.  A three-hour window was given for Friday, 7/1/11, between 11-2.  No call, no show.  So we called them and were told they were so sorry and they would send our concern to dispatch.  Dispatch called at 3 and they said they were so sorry, their serviceman was just leaving a job that had held him up and he would be here soon.  They called at 5 pm and said they were so sorry but their serviceman was still at the other job but would be here between 5 and 6.  No call, no show.  Called back and they said they were so sorry, they will check and that they didn't know what happened and they'd send this over to dispatch.  Dispatch called and you guessed it, they said ""so sorry"" but he will be there by 7 pm.  No call, no show.  We called again, and they said, ""So sorry but he has not been put in a cancel notice so he 'must' be coming. No, we didn't know when, I understand you were upset and I would be, too.  Yes, I can have a supervisor call you back.""The time, oh it will be one to two hours!  For the third time, they will credit my bill whole $20.  Wow.  Serviceman finally got here at 7:30 pm, saying, ""So sorry.  Yes, I had your number but no, dispatch was supposed to call.""  Did I hear from a supervisor?  You guessed it, ""NO"".    "
"Maritza of Lancaster, PA",7/2/2011,,"I upgraded my Comcast Internet package to Extreme 50 on 5/22/11.  Since then, I have had one week of the advertised speed.  I have been on the phone every day with a representative whose answer is to send out another technician. I have had a total of five techs and the tech supervisor came out to my home. I have told them over and over that the problem is the outside line but they insisted on coming in to check my equipment inside.  Everything is new.  To this day, Comcast has done nothing to rectify the issue. "
"Sungwon of Pittsburgh, PA",7/3/2011,,"Comcast arbitrarily changed the schedules twice without any prior notice or consultation.  They pretended that the rescheduling never happened and that I confused the dates.On June 21, I did a live chat with a Comcast assistant and disconnection of the Internet service was scheduled for June 28.  However, no one showed up on June 28!  After waiting for Comcast's technicians the whole day, I called Comcast and was told that my appointment was ORIGINALLY scheduled for July 2, not June 28.  They should be ashamed of themselves for telling such a lie. Had I been told that all of the Comcast technicians would be so busy during the high season for moving and could not help rescheduling my appointment, I would have understood the situation. However, they lied to me about the appointment. I still keep the record of the live chat stating that the appointment was originally planned for June 28, not July 2.  I think that after Comcast rescheduled my appointments, the company removed the record of the original schedule to pretend that the rescheduling never happened.Anyway, on July 2, I waited for Comcast's technicians the whole day again, but no one showed up again! When I called Comcast, I heard that this time, my appointment was ORIGINALLY scheduled for July 20!  Do I have to pay one more month because of the company's reschedule and lie?  I am moving out next week!  They messed up my moving schedule!  I was so upset so the assistant let me talk to his supervisor, who advanced the appointment from July 20 to July 5. This time, I hope to meet real human beings sent by Comcast."
"Marie of Pembroke, MA",7/3/2011,,"I am a loyal Comcast customer abused by rude representative (operator BZB) while paying bill at Marshfield, MA office.On July 1, 2011, I had an upsetting experience here while paying my bill.  There was an error on my balance (recently downsized services and had credit, which wasn't reflected on balance due).  The male service representative (operator BZB) approached me at the counter.  Barely a moment after I inquired about the error, he rudely replied, ""I'm not going to spend an hour with you!"" He went on to say, ""last time I spent 55 minutes with you and later you complained about me.""I stood there stunned as he insulted me with a coworker and customers present.  Refusing me service, he made me get in the other representative's line.  Evidently, he held a grudge against me (the consumer) for wasting his time the prior month!  Yes, I spent time reviewing options, figuring out which services to change, etc. I turned in cable boxes for free adapters to save dollars.  Once home, the CC technical department couldn't activate them (operator BZB failed to enter needed codes), causing us a loss of cable for two days! Who should be mad over wasted time and mistreatment?"
"Shannon of La Porte, TX",7/4/2011,,"I was told by Comcast when the Digital conversion was made that their customers did not need to worry because ""..,they had us covered."". Now I am being told that I need to buy converters to wartch their service. This is not only on the analog Tv's I have, but also the new TV I bought my son in Febuary is not getting the channels he did before, this is a brand new RCA HD TV. Can they legally make me buy these devices when they told us before ""that we didn't need to do anything."" ?"
"Laura of Hattiesburg, MS",7/6/2011,,"Billing jumped in 1 month from $96 to $136 to $145 and now we are being told $150.  Explanation totally unclear, and the billing is so confusing even a CPA couldn't figure it out.  Credits, debits, 30 days, 34 days, package, etc. and the service stinks.  Hardly a day without some interruption."
"Mark of Buffalo Grove, IL",7/6/2011,,"Years ago I bought a TiVo HD unit.  I was told by Comcast that I could buy the cards for a one-time charge. For one year or so, I had no charge after the initial charge.  I bought four more units and when I received the new cards, they changed the deal.  But due to the confusion, they charged me a reduced fee for six cards and nothing for the rest.  This went on for many years until about five months ago when a service call was made and they had to reset my cards.  Since then my bill went up over 100 dollars.  They openly admit that they do not know how to put my account back to where it should be. I have spoken with so many people but nobody has gotten back to me except one supervisor who won't return my calls. I am stuck with Comcast due to the 5000 dollars I have invested in my TiVos. I need help. My email is **. My cell is ** and my home is **.  Thank you. Mark."
"Lien of Snellville, GA",7/7/2011,,"I disconnected Comcast May 2nd 2011.  I was told by a Comcast rep to return the equipments to the nearest Comcast office within the week.  So that was exactly what I did on May 3rd & got a receipt of returned equipments.  The receipt also showed the account had 2 cents credit.  I even verified with the rep at that office that I didn't owe anything.   Then later on, I received phone calls from Comcast asking for their equipments. I told them that I have proof that their equipments were returned.  They basically said not to worry.  Then I received a bill in early June charging me for unreturned equipments.  I called & spoke to yet another Comcast rep.  I was so upset.  The lady looked up my account & I was on hold a long time while she researched.  She came back at the end & told me not to worry b/c the system showed that I don't owe anything.  I asked for a confirmation email, but she said there wasn't a way for her to do that.  Then today July 7th, I got another bill same as in June!  I call Comcast again. I asked for a supervisor.  After being on hold 15 minutes the rep came back on to tell me he can't find a supervisor.  Then he connected me to Nadia.  Again I explained my situation.  She said I still owe Comcast for the modem.  I explained that I  didn't have modem owned by Comcast;  I had an old modem that was offered for free six years ago via Comcast promotion w/ Bestbuy.  When that modem died, I purchased another modem.  All with my own money.  At first rep Nadia didn't want to hear, but eventually listened.  So finally she said she would have the matter researched & removed the charge for now.  Comcast have lost me for life, & I will spread the word. "

I have now been on hold for now exaggeration. One hour and 22 minutes and still waiting. I am filling this out on the computer that still works, so far.

"Richard of Groveland, MA",7/11/2011,,"I have ""basic cable."" I used to get the Red Sox baseball games and the local news on basic cable. Xfinity changed that so all I get with ""basic cable"" is a bunch of Spanish channels, two Boston channels and a bunch of PBS stations. I can no longer get Red Sox baseball or the New England Patriots football. Both of these sports programs are available off-the-air in the Boston area and according to my interpretation of the FCC rules, therefore are supposed to be duplicated on the cable.Therefore, Comcast violates FCC rules. Any attempt to fix this, either through the FCC or through Comcast fails. Comcast claims that any lawsuit will fail because their lawyers are paid for by their stockholders while my lawyers are paid out of my pocket so I should, ""see the consequences of any such action."" This was their response when I threatened to sue them."
"Diane of Manassas, VA",7/12/2011,,"Comcast has confirmed that the wiring to my house, a main line, is in need of repair and requires permits. In the mean time, I have four cable boxes; and on a daily basis, we have patchy screens or blue screens. The internet is out frequently too. They refuse to credit me anything on my bill until this is resolved. This is going on for years; and I am not the only one in our townhouse cluster."
"Ellyn of San Mateo, CA",7/13/2011,,"I couldn't get online in the internet although my internet phone worked. My internet phone is Vonage, not Comcast. When I called Comcast, Beatrice told me I would have to pay $39.99 for wireless help. This never happened before. It's a revenue drive, in my opinion."
"Merna of Salida, CO",7/13/2011,,"I cancelled my service with Comcast because I moved to an area they do not service.  I returned the equipment and when I received the final statement dated 6/3/2011 I went online and entered a payment for the balance on 6/27/2011.I told them this was an incorrect amount that I had just had a conversation with them on 7/10 and was waiting for the correction.  I was told by the collection company that I needed to contact Comcast.   I hug up, called and was told by the computer my balance due was 23.67, then I got a person(Jim) and was told my balance was past due more then 90 days and was 25.41.    I said this was not true, I was not past due and if I was where were the late fees and notices?? He looked said there were not late fees and when I mentioned that their computer message stated my balance was 23.67 and he is now saying 25.41 what do I really owe, he took my credit card information to pay the balance due of 23.67 and stated he would have the collection information corrected and inform them that the account is paid in full.   I am wondering why this company is allowed to do this and use the process.  If I was a dead beat and had a history of not paying my bills I would not be upset but this process is insulting."
"Wilfredo of Concord, CA",7/14/2011,,"I start my service with Comcast 7 months ago. When I spoke with the sales rep in the concord brunch, he offered me a complete package plus the Latino channels and internet for about 115 dollars a month for the first 6 months, after that it would be 135 dollars per month. When the 6th month happened i receive a bill for 135 dollars; however the seven month my came for the amount of 165 dollars. When i call them to complain about it, they said that it was a mistake from the salesman but the only way to get my plan cheaper would be downgrading it."

"Laura of Denver, CO",7/14/2011,,"I received a letter saying the extra two boxes I received with my digital preferred package would no longer get all the stations I paid for.  These boxes were provided as part of the package when I purchased it.  I called and they told me that for a promotional price of $9.99 per month for 12 months, I could continue to get the channels on the additional two boxes.  I feel this is a way Comcast goes around the system to implement a price increase without getting approval like they normally have to.  Can something be done?"
"John of Seattle, WA",7/16/2011,,"I have limited cable from Comcast.  It is basically channels 2-13 with no extras. I received a flyer in the mail to upgrade my service.  The flyer advertised their digital starter cable package and internet for 39.99 a month for 12 months,  with a 2 year commitment.  I called the number on the flyer and a rep informed me that he didn't know how to upgrade my account and to call a different 1800 number.  So I called that number,  and the rep told me that the package did not exist and I needed to take my flyer into a comcast service center in person.  So I went to the nearest service center with my flyer in hand.  The rep at the store told me that they have never heard of the package and that they would look into it and to call back in several days.  I left the store extremely dissatisfied because they offered no resolution.  I couldn't believe that Comcast didn't at least say, ""We can't offer you this package,  but here is a different one...""  which I probably wouldn't have taken,  but it would have been good customer service to try to resolve the problem.  Instead I was simply sent away.  I called them back later that evening to make a complaint to a manager and was told that they could sign me up no problem.  We will see when I get my first bill if I am in fact under the plan that I wanted because according to most of their reps that plan didn't exist.  This isn't the first time I have heard of Comcast commited advertising fraud.  In 2010 my girlfriend signed up for their service and was given the bait and switch on her plan.  It took 60 days and a complaint to better business to get it sorted out in their computer.  "
"Jay of Marlton, NJ",7/19/2011,,"I called Comcast because we were getting intermittent internet service. They sent a technician that indicated my modem was bad, and was replaced. The problem continued. I was still getting service only if I disconnected the cable from the back of the modem and replaced it. I called again, and a different technician came and diagnosed the problem being from outside and not the modem. The first technician has taken my modem as I did not  need it anymore. They sent a Comcast truck with a technician from Comcast. He indicated that there were several problems, and he replaced several items in the box outside. I called Comcast to get a credit for not having to use the service. They indicated they can only give credit for one month because there was intermittent service and there will be no credit for the modem. They are still charging me for the modem even though they have my personal modem.Basically, we did not use the service for over 4 months as what was indicated by the service person. Mr. Ron indicated they can see how much usage of the internet we had, but he will not provide me with that information. He further indicated that he will call other technicians and find out what has happened. He also indicated that they do not give credit for intermittent service even though it was the first technician that failed to diagnose the problem correctly, and gave me a modem that I did not need and charged me $7 per month for the modem.   "
"Gale of Richmond, VA",7/20/2011,,"I had been a satisfied customer with Adelphia and later Comcast for well over 32 years. After their decision to outsource technical services and establish a complaint deterrent automated system, the level of incompetence and total disregard for customers has been a nightmare for over five years. I am a retired divorcee who survives on a restricted income and I faithfully pay Comcast $143.20 each month before the due date. In December 2010, I purchased a bundled service package with Comcast that included cable, internet, and telephone services. The contractual installer who installed the Internet and telephone equipment admitted that he was a novice which was quite evident by the length of time it took him to affix an inferior and primitive cable wiring display throughout hallway walls and floor. In retrospect, I also have ADT security services and whenever the telephone is disabled, my security services are also disabled. Since June 17, 2011, I intermittently had no telephone and Internet services for extended periods which ranged from 2 to 24 hours. Initially, I felt these problems were related to some strange power surge and was reluctant to complain. However, after experiencing 2 to 24 hour disruptions between July 11, 2011 and July 18, 2011, I requested a service call. After being placed on hold for 20 minutes, they finally dispatched a technician who arrived at 2:10PM and adjusted the wire outside and replaced the Comcast modem. He was unable to ascertain the source of the problem and left at 5:45PM. At 6:10PM, the internet and phone were off again. I have placed nine service calls, spoken with numerous supervisors, written to the CEO and the issues have not been resolved as of July 19, 2011. Thus, I am seeking restitution of fees paid for services that were not rendered. After reviewing the numerous complaints from almost every state, it is obvious that this company needs closer scrutiny and oversight. 97% of the 132 complaints received between October 16, 2010 and July 14, 2011 were related to billing practices and disruptions which are not regarding unpaid accounts.

"Victor of Atlanta, GA",7/21/2011,,"I hate Comcast!  I have had service problems with my cable TV ever since I got a new DTS box.  I have spent weeks on the phone with customer service representatives trying to troubleshoot the problem.  They would send a signal across and the TV would finally work again but go out the very next day.  This happened over six times.  I have had four service calls scheduled and nobody ever showed up.  I took an off at work four times and I have lost vacation time and wages that have cost me over $1,000 so far. Did I say I hate Comcast!  I am sick because of all the stress that they have caused me!  I hate Comcast!  You are full of bunch of lies, cheats, thieves, lies and more lies.  I hate Comcast!  And I really hate lies!  One day Comcast will be out of business because they just don't care!Victor **"
"Patrick of Hammonton, NJ",7/22/2011,,"After buying a new house, we called to transfer service. Comcast came out and set up our TV, phone, and Internet connection. A week later, we received a letter stating, ""As discussed, we will require a deposit from you prior to providing you with service."" The letter continued, ""In evaluating your request, Equifax provided us with information that influenced our decision to require a deposit"". We were shocked by this, since we have had Comcast for 12 years, and have never been asked to give a deposit! Moreover, we just bought a house. My wife and I both have credit scores above 770. I called to complain about this and actually got the ""information from Equifax"", but Janekia 9NV told me that it was a mistake. The technician should have checked another box! When I asked for more information, none was provided. This was outrageous on principal. I quickly cancelled all the services from Comcast and will never use them again. It seems they have to find more money because they bought NBC!"
"Gewargis of Modesto, CA",7/23/2011,,"This company applies excessive fees and taxes; they do back charging for unwarranted repairs, tripling the equipment rental and provide fake and false promotions."
"Antonio of Miami, FL",7/23/2011,,"Comcast is the worse service anyone can ever experience. I am unable to connect to the Internet; I get to connect for 15 minutes, then the server is not found. I reported the problem when the technicians went to my house. They said they donâ€™t see anything wrong; especially when the Internet happened to work at that time. I am paying for service, but it does not really matter to them. Comcast is like the government. You don't have too many choices. They do whatever they want, and you can do nothing about it if you want cable service. I have no choice. They are very unprofessional. I am going to AT&T. It has caused a lot of aggravation on my part, but they expect me to pay my bill, regardless the poor service they provide. We should all go for class action against Comcast. I hope someone will take the initiative.  I am also a victim of their business department. They made me wait for three weeks for the Internet service to be installed. I had to call them first, and they told me that they needed to do construction work to be able to provide the Internet service. They assigned a sales representative to call, Patrick **, who never cared to give me a call and tell me what was going on.  They are the rudest people I ever deal with."
"Randall of Eustis, FL",7/24/2011,,"My internet has been out for three days with intermittent service.  When I called in, I got the same script each time.  I scheduled a service visit five days out. That's the soonest available.  However, I asked for a technician to check the outside of my house sooner, maybe they could drive by to see if there is a problem outside. Yesterday when I called Comcast, they told me there was on outage in my area.  They can only come and check out the inside first. They don't check the outside first. The lame person on the phone said they couldn't send someone out to look on the outside and that I would need to keep my appointment if I wanted service.  Comcast is a horrible company with horrible customer service!"
"Marilyn of Tupelo, MS",7/25/2011,,"I have had cable service with comcast for several years and always had trouble with my service.  The cable goes in and out all the time and I am seldom able to watch anything.  Over the years, they have tried several things to fix the problem such as new wiring and new cable box.  They have given me a discount a couple of times.  But over the last few months, I think they have decided not to do anything else.  They hang up on me, they are rude, they say they will call me back and don't, they don't keep appointments and don't call.  I am really so frustrated.  I don't know wht else to do.  Thanks for your help"
"Eleanor of Chicago, IL",7/26/2011,,"Comcast Internet high-speed is not high-speed at all.  It is slow and getting slower. I am paying for high-speed Internet, and not getting this service."
"Jeffrey of Spring, TX",7/26/2011,,"Ordered new service on 7/21/2011 and for some reason they wanted me to come into a service center to see my license.  I've had service with them for years at my prior address, and my credit is perfect.  She gave me an option to call a toll-free number so they could verify information over the phone.  I called; the gentleman took my driver's license number, and told me everything was complete.  I asked if I still need to go to a service center and he said, no.  On 7/25/2011, I received a confirmation call for the installation on 7/26/2011 between 12 - 2 PM.  That time passed; so, I called and they told me they would contact the installation team and call me.  Well, at 5:30 no call; so I called again.  This time the person tells me that I need to go to a service center so they can verify my driver's license.  Needless to say, I'm more than furious!  I've wasted the entire day waiting for someone to arrive.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and she tells me she has to leave them a message to call me back.  We'll see if that ever happens."
"Ricardo of Elk Grove, CA",7/26/2011,,"After reading over my first bill I have found I am being charged with undisclosed activation/installation fees that exceeded the $35 they told me I was to expect. After asking the sales representative various times before initiating a contract with them if there are going to be any other fees besides the $35 for installation/activation, I was told, no."
"Wayne of Brockton, MA",7/27/2011,,"Late last summer my 46 inch TV stopped wprking. I called Comcast as I wanted to see if it was my TV or the cable box. The repairman came out just use some electrical testing equipment and said the box was good, but the TV was no good. I asked him if he could hook up another box to my set and be sure. He said he didn't have room in his truck for another box. (These are quite small). I told him I had another box on a TV upstairs, could he use that one. He said I don't have time, it's your set! That day I bought a new 47 inch LG set from Best Buy. It was delivered 3 weeks later as in Massacusetts they had a sales tax weekend and it created quite a backlog of orders.It was the box all along. I called Comcast and they sent another man along who brought in a new box, which did work, but for their cheaper program. I told him I wanted the one I was supposed to get and he told me they were all out, but he knew where he could get one in a few days. Later that day I called Comcast and they did have the correct boxes in stock and a new one was installed.I called Comcast about the initial repair persons error, but was told I should have gotten a second opinion."
"Mark of Richmond, IN",7/28/2011,,"I subscribe to Comcast Internet service. Lately, I have been losing signal occasionally and also my Internet service.  I have made repeated calls about the outages with no resolution.  Today, I was told that my modem is bad. After checking with people knowledgeable about cable modems; I was convinced that it's working fine. What a bunch of losers Comcast is.   They're greedy and dishonest.  If you can get service elsewhere, I advise you to do so.  I already changed my TV to satellite service; more channels, less expensive, and more reliable service-- believe it or not."
"Lynda of Kittery, ME",7/28/2011,,"A year or two ago, when the government made their changes to the TV airwaves to the whole country, we were assured that as long as you have cable TV, you would  be okay, and would not be affected. Comcast told its customers the same, ""you'll be okay"", and â€œwouldn't need to do anything.â€ About one year later, ooops, Comcast tells us they are changing, and you'll have to get the new type of service and boxes (for each TV). If you don't, you go down to the lowest level, and will barely get any channels at all. Of course the new service was much higher, but we went with it. NOW, almost a year later to the day, got another notice, saying THAT service will no longer be available, and we will have to get the NEW service and MORE NEW boxes (at a cost), or basically we will have nothing, and they gave me about two weeks to decide. First thought to come to my mind? ""You people S**K, and should be ashamed! Comcast is the only reason I complain at only being given two weeks to decide. I'm trying to decide whether to switch to Dish Network or DirecTV, and there's a lot of research I need to do to decide.This is what happens when one company is allowed to have a monopoly. In this day and age, why is this still allowed?"
"Dot of Houston, TX",7/29/2011,,Comcast -- so Cocky now they don't even fear FCC nor U.S. Senators! Intermittent service year after year -- every month -- every week and sometimes daily! for approximately 4years -- it's no longer trivial.I even resorted to telling Comcast that Houstonians should petition and complain to FCC and Texas senators. Comcast basically laughed and said go ahead --they would help me with information! (very cocky). Comcast knows they wield endless power now & are completely untouchable and unafraid to even the FCC!
"Mark of Arvada, CO",7/30/2011,,"My high speed internet and telephone service stopped working. When I reported the trouble, a service call was scheduled. I was then told there was an ""area outage"" and Comcast canceled my service appointment. Two days later, Comcast called to say the problem was resolved. When I reset my modem, I still had no service. I called and was told I needed to schedule a service call. The soonest it would be was three days away. I was offered the option to take my modem to their office and exchange it. When I went to their office, I received what I thought was another modem. Wrong! All they did was replace the battery. My modem was still bad. I returned this modem a second time and received another modem. The people on the activation line at Comcast could not get the new modem to work. I then called the Comcast High Speed Internet tech support number. After spending about two hours on my cell phone with the tech, my modem was finally working. I spent 4 hours of my time exchanging modems and working with techs along with using my cell phone minutes due to Comcast not being able to get my modem to work. Now a week later, I am having problems with the speed of my internet connection. I am getting 20 to 22 mbps download and 4 mbps upload. I was told I needed to have a service appointment which is scheduled for tomorrow. My internet was only working 1/2 the time. The Comcast employees are totally incompetent!"
"Jim of Lancaster, PA",7/30/2011,,"When Comcast required the use of boxes to get their cable feed since last summer, we have been playing TV roulette. We never know if we are going to have reception or not. I am a big Philly sports fan, so Comcast is the only way to view some of the Phillies, Flyers and Sixer games or else, I would bail from their service. Often times I canâ€™t watch games or view blocked images and lose every 3rd word of a telecast. We have had service people out a number of times. They tinker with the line and leave with the problem unresolved. Service people are polite but they just don't resolve the issue."
"Donald of Enfield, CT",7/30/2011,,"Comcast is an incompetent and dishonest company. They claim that I owe them $414 for residential service at three addresses in Springfield, MA in 2010. They have sent it to collections as I refuse to pay.  I have lived in Enfield, CT for the last 20+ years. I have never lived in Springfield, own no property there and have no friends or family there either.When I spoke to an agent on the phone, she claimed that it was impossible that they had made a mistake and that it was my responsibility to pay because my SSN was on that account. In the unlikely event that someone actually used my SSN, I filed a police report with the Springfield Police Department and gave the report number to Comcast on July 21st. Since then, I have heard nothing from Comcast. However, today I got another demanding letter from the collection agency in Texas."
"Thomas of Key Largo, FL",3/1/2012,,"Phone, internet, TV break up, totally unreliable - For 2 years, we have called Comcast to complain about the service. They send service people out, they all tell us the problem is not enough power coming from the street. The power needs to be boosted, but they refused. The service people told us Comcast will not spend the money to correct it."
"Gwyneth of Eugene, OR",3/2/2012,,"A sales person compared my total phone bill from competitor, then said Comcast could reduce cost if I added phone service to my Comcast Internet. He failed to point out the hidden costs that made it higher. I called twice to confirm my monthly bill, and Customer Service confirmed what I was told by the salesperson, but they also didn't mention the additional costs.When my bills came in higher, I disputed my bill, only to find out about the hidden costs 3 months later, outside the 30-day cancellation period. The link to billing details in my online account was broken. The online statement is not clear, which goes against their guarantee: ""We will offer easy-to-understand packages and provide you with a clear bill. Our packages are designed to be straightforward. A call or visit to our website makes it easy to find a package that's right for you. We aim for the same clarity with our bills. You can view your monthly statement and service details anytime by visiting Comcast Customer Central.""Outcome so far: Third call to customer service revealed hidden costs and the rep offered $10 reduction on my current bill. I am writing to corporate's ""Escalation Department"" to ask for refund of modem installation and difference between the quoted monthly billing and actual."
"Patricia of Romeoville, IL",3/2/2012,,"We have internet and basic cable through Comcast. We have our payments set up for automatic withdrawal every month. The first problem is that the withdrawal amount is not the same each month. We have not ordered pay per view or other on demand services that have a fee so our service should be the same every month. They were unable to explain this and we do not get a statement each month that would help.My next compliant has to do with our current bill. I have it set up for automatic withdrawal every month and this past month, though our bank account shows that they with drew the funds for payment, they are claiming we did not pay. So now not only are they charging the fee for service again but they have added late fees, turned off the service, and now want another fee for reinstating our service. I specifically set up the automatic payment so this would not happen.My husband made a phone call to Comcast customer service and they were unwilling to resolve the issue over the phone. They said they would ""investigate.â€ They wanted us to pay the so called ""past due amount"" before they would turn our service on again. My husband has taken our bank statement to the local Comcast office to show the proof of payment. Our desire is that they will acknowledge the payment that was made (now twice), remove all the erroneous fees and restore our service. We would leave Comcast if we had another option."
"william of Johnson City, TN",3/3/2012,,"Comcast TV, internet, home phone - I switched service from Century Link on 8/4/2011 to Comcast. I am continuing to be billed by Century Link.

I am paying Comcast for their service. I need help in resolving this problem."
"Michaela  of Fort Myers, FL",3/3/2012,,"We set up an appointment to have an HD/DVR box on Thursday, March 1st between 5PM-7PM. A technician came out who could barely speak English. After an hour of being on hold with dispatch, he attempted to install a box that did not work. He then attempted to install two other boxes that he had in his truck, but neither of them worked or could not be installed to my TV apparently because it was not HDMI-ready. I put the order in a week ago and informed Comcast of what cable box was needed and necessary for installation. After another hour of trying to communicate with dispatch, the technician informed me that he would be out the next evening to install a temporary box until the correct HD/DVR box became available. I also spoke to a supervisor on the phone who assured me that I would have a cable box the following night regardless.The following evening, we waited three hours for a technician to arrive, never received a call until the last hour from someone stating that there was no cable boxes available and he would not be able to make the appointment and then hung up. I called and spoke to seven different people and was on hold for two straight hours, most of them could not speak fluent English, to try to come to terms as to what the story was. All seven people could not assist me and basically told me that there was nothing they could do. I continued to call the following day to try to determine, after 20 years of service, why I was not getting any answers or assistance. I am a real estate agent and work with a lot of people. I have recommended Comcast for all my clients and renters. This will not be the case any longer. I am appalled at the level of bad service this company has shown during my particular situation and many, many other situations with my clients in the past. How difficult is it for a company as large as Comcast to communicate with their customers in a proper and more respectful way? Your assistance in this matter will be greatly appreciated!"
"Denzil of Nashville, TN",3/5/2012,,"First Bill from Comcast for Internet: I signed up for a 6-month special on Comcast. First, it would not let me choose to install myself, so I thought okay $25.00 and let them do it. I got my bill today and it has the $20.00 install fee plus a $30.00 in-home service visit fee, plus a $25.00 Internet adjustment fee (that nobody can tell me what it is). I told them I was reading the confirmation email that stated a one-time $25.00 installation fee. After calling 3 times and getting disconnected twice, I was told they were going to do me a favor and credit my account $25.00 next month. I was told the $30 in-home service fee is for them coming out, not for installing, even though it was never mentioned. So I said, â€œThen shouldn't you advertise it as $55.00 install fee?â€ I got no reply."
"Amy of Silver Spring, MD",3/5/2012,,"Comcast came to my door at about 6pm tonight, March 5, 2012. He did not knock, he banged. Before I could get up to answer the door, he banged louder. I opened and he began his solicitation and I politely said, ""Oh we already have cable. We're good, thanks.â€ He said, ""But do you have Comcast?"" I said, ""No, we're good with our cable, thanks but no thanks."" He pushed again, asking who our cable company was. I had to close the door while he was still gesturing and talking. I tried to be polite.This was not an okay solicitation. Do not send another Comcast employee to my house or I will call the police and report the individual and you as a company. Leave us alone. Thank you."
"Courtney of Atlanta, GA",3/5/2012,,Comcast has messed up on my bill two months in a row. I want to cancel and they are stubborn and rude about waiving my early termination fee. They put you on hold for 40 minutes at a time and the service reps are extremely rude and not helpful.
"Janina of Des Plaines, IL",3/6/2012,,"I called Comcast and I tried to find out how much I owe them until the end of March so we can have time to switch the service and we both can use the Internet until the last day when I am here.  When I talked to the customer service woman, she told me that I have to pay them another $25 because last month, there was an automatic payment attempted which was later reversed by my bank.  That additional charge was $25.I reviewed my checking account for Comcast's past payments for the last two to three years.  There was no record for any ""paid and later reversed payments"" made to Comcast in the bank's online records.  I even called the bank and when I told them what happened, they told me that they have other records aside from the ones that I see on the bank's website.I called Comcast again and they told me that I should ask the bank to verify that the ""reversed payment was not made.""  Then, I told Comcast that they should verify to me that payments were attempted.  They should have documents regarding all the changes posted to the customers' accounts, including documents regarding additional fees.Then, the Comcast employee told me that those ""proofs"" are part of the ""Comcast general accounting ledger"" and that they cannot share that information with me.  That was too much.  I told them that my bank payment verification is also part of my ""personal general accounting ledger"" and that I also cannot share that information with them.  At the end, I just could not keep that service one more day and let them use my money.  I told them to discontinue the service tomorrow.  That is a description of how my 7-year old relationship with Comcast has ended on March 6, 2012."
"Lontine  of Dublin, OH",3/6/2012,,"I moved to another state so I called Comcast in advance on 02/23/12 to disconnect service on 02/28/12 and turned in equipment on 02/29/12. I woke up to find that my cable was still on. I called Comcast and asked why was my cable still on and was told that my disconnect would be on 03/08/12. I then was like, ""This is not fare I will be charged for days that are not being used and I am in another state. I would like those days taken off."" I was informed there is nothing that can be done. I was like, ""Even if it is $.50, it is not right."" I was told when I called and took the equipment in, that on that day I would have the disconnect. Thank you."
"Hoangthu of Antioch, TN",3/7/2012,,"We ordered the triple Pack last week, Tuesday, self-installation. They said it'll arrive in 2 to 3 days. We waited and waited until Monday of this week, it still didn't arrive so we called customer service. They said it didn't send out for some reason, so we called cooperate office. They sent people out Tuesday, got everything installed, however, I was at work, didn't know which products they put in. So I came home, they installed a beat up wireless router, a cable box that's almost as big as my TV, dch3200. The router internet speed so slow, I have to pay a monthly fee for that beat up thing. So I called customer service and asked why they install used products, they said that's what they do, they install used products. They said if we want another cable box, we have to go to their office. But man, the question I have for them is do they do that to all their clients? Well, I don't think so but that's just terrible. Well, if you're reading this post, think twice before you sign up with Comcast."
"Ron of Hattiesburg , MS",3/7/2012,,"We started Comcast services with (I believe they call them digital) boxes--three regular and one with the HD / DVR support. Last year, we had problems with two of our Comcast boxes on two different occasions. We called for repair. When the tech came on site, he concluded on each occasion that the boxes were faulty and needed replacing. We paid for the service protection plan.When the techs replaced the boxes, they replaced them with upgraded-type boxes. We had no idea that these were upgraded boxes. We don't know how to distinguish between the equipment. I did notice a difference in the boxes (One was smaller than the original.), but I assumed that these particular boxes were what was needed to repair the problem we had. All we wanted was the problem fixed, for we were happy with the original boxes.All of a sudden, we started noticing a price increase. We weren't sure what the problem was. We called to have services and had plans changed, subscriptions dropped, anything we thought was causing the price increase. We called on several occasions to have HBO dropped, but Comcast never dropped HBO.After calling today, we find out that we have been paying for upgraded boxes. We told the tech that we didn't request any upgraded boxes, but the service techs brought the boxes and installed them to resolve a problem and never told us that we would be paying for upgrades. The tech we talked to today stated that nothing can be done about it and that if we wanted the boxes changed, we would have to bring them to Comcast ourselves. Furthermore, Comcast has been charging us for having 6 boxes instead of 4. What kind of customer support and service is this? We always pay our bills on time and give your company no problems. We feel that we shouldn't be paying for this and the burden shouldn't be placed on us to have it fixed.I see the options. I can care less whether an attorney contacts me or not. All I want is fair service, not to be taken advantage of our knowledge (or lack of) of the equipment, and this problem being resolved without costing us. I would like to discuss it with senior Comcast personnel and not a phone/help desk tech. I would like an answer ASAP."
"Tim of Manteca, CA",3/8/2012,,"On 2-22-12, I requested disconnection from Comcast cable service. I returned all of my equipment to the Manteca Comcast service center on 2-24-12. At the time of returning my equipment, I was told that I was missing a modem. I told them that I returned the modem about 6 months ago because I had purchased a new modem so that I would no longer have to pay the lease. The person at the counter tried to look it up on the computer and told me that the record did not show up and that I need to ""go back home and look for the modem.""When I went home, I did not find a modem; but I found a bill showing credit for the modem being returned on 10-27-2011. A week later, I got a bill for $450 for unreturned equipment, including the modem and all the equipment I returned to the store on 2-22-12. I called and emailed Comcast customer support. They told me I needed to drive over to the local service center during business hours and talk to them there. On 2-28-12, I used my hard-earned vacation time off work to take off an hour to drive over to Comcast. I was told they had no record of a return, and I was told again to ""go home and look for the equipment."" I'm now being billed from Comcast for $450 for working equipment that they have."
"Sue of Pleasant hill, mo",3/9/2012,,"Charge way too much money - I live in a little town. The only way I can get TV is to get Comcast. Dish TV needs a credit card which I do not own one. I pay $150.00 each month just to get nothing. And there is not a ** thing I can do. Iâ€™m on SSI disability income. So they know if I can go get something new, they got you where they want you at."
"V of Newbury, MA",3/9/2012,,"I am 67. In all my years. I have never, ever dealt with a worse company in terms of product. Your support people are lovely and they trying to be helpful. But let me tell you what we have suffered with Comcast cable TV and Comcast Tivo: Awful, awful service. We have been able to use our TV about 2 months out of the last 12. We have had your service people here at least 15 times in the last year or so. We simply never can watch TV. Our service is always not working. I asked for a supervisor to call me back. None did. If I say that I will take your follow-up survey, the phone rings but there is no one there. I feel as if I am in the third world of a third world country. You truly can't represent yourselves as a service. You are a disgrace. We are switching service: Our computer, our TV, our phone and will never, ever use a Comcast service again. Further, I will be contacting our reps in congress to point out that you do not merit your licensing."
"Beth of Vancouver, WA",3/10/2012,,"I called in this morning and got a recorded message that there was an outage in the area. I didn't have internet access all day. That night, I called in and although they got my modem online, all of a sudden, my router doesn't work. The rep said, she'd tell me how to connect my computer directly to the modem (sigh). I don't know how to do that! When I asked what caused the outage, she said that the ""trouble ticket"" had been closed and so, there was no way to find out what the issue was.I asked if I went to the local office if they could tell me. She assured me there was no way to find out what and why the outage occurred. My router is not ""end of life"" since it's only a year old. I want to know what the outage was and if there is any recourse to fixing my issue."
"William of Colorado Springs, CO",3/10/2012,,"They ignored first amendment rights and ignored dispute letter for over-charging and making false charges for services not provided. Internet is for $29.99 or $10; cable, for $65.54 or $75.  However, Comcast wants $300 a month for services that were not given or started. This is fraud on the account."
"Ondria of Apt. c6, CT",3/10/2012,,"I purchased a new TV in December 2010. I contacted Comcast of New Haven to set up new box for TV. I had several technicians out, outsourced help and five non-working boxes. I finally got fed up and put in a complaint to PURA (Public Utility Control Agency) online. A person called me and I explained my problem that I'd been having for almost three solid months. I was granted a credit for my problem but still have to wait for an adjusted bill. Once this is settled, I'll feel better, but I'm considering switching services. My sister changed company and I'm waiting to see how she likes it. Only a few more weeks and I may switch. If you have a utility problem, call Public Utility Control in your area. That's their job and they may be able to help after you've tried to resolve it yourself. Good luck!"
"Mark  of Houston, TX",3/10/2012,,"In September, Comcast switched to digital ""upgrade"" and required everyone to get either boxes or adapter. The adapters are free. The boxes you get charged for even if your TV is cable ready â€“ no box needed. At the end of January, Comcast started sending me a bill for their service. My service is paid thru my HOA dues. I did not upgrade to a box. I only use the adapters. After several phone calls, they said they would remove all charges and fees. They did not, but only removed half the bill. The next month I received another bill. Once again after several phone calls, they said it would be removed. They removed it and cut the cable, even though itâ€™s paid thru the HOA. Here it is a month after and I have no cable and thereâ€™s another bill! I have spent the last hour and 40 minutes speaking with 6 different people to resolve this problem. I kept getting transferred and dropped or put on indefinite hold. This is harassment and bullying. I am fed up with Comcast. Everyone I speak to has the same problem. I want a class action lawsuit against Comcast for harassment, double billing, fraudulent advertising and over all scamming its customers. Prior to the switch, I had one remote for my TV and a couple of HD channels. After the switch I have no HD channels, a crappy picture and now I have to use 2 remotes to operate my TV."
"Janette  of Bristow, VA",3/10/2012,,"In January 2012, I received a bill for $132.42 around the expected amount for services we ordered. We paid $133.00. In February 2012, our bill was only $15.71. We paid $20.00. Then March bill came in, and it shows we owe $403.20 in total new charges. How in the world did our bill go from $135 to $400 in a two-month period? Even if we had an average bill in February, we would still only owe approximately $270. We do not rent movies from OnDemand, because we have Netflix and OD is too expensive to watch. We have our own modem, and on the bill for March, we received a $20 credit because a service tech had to come out and replace the DVR box for the fifth time. Our internet is so slow that my computer times out on me. The ""newest"" DVR does not record correctly--everything is so digitized it cannot be seen or heard. And now I get a bill for $270 more than what we normally pay. And our house is brand-new and custom-built, so we know it is not aged wiring. Comcast has already had to rewire from the street box to the house once. So after sitting on hold for nearly an hour waiting for Customer (non)Service to pick up, I am seeking ways to file a legal complaint against Comcast. Maybe this will force them to fix the problem and not think charging a customer for services they are not getting will go unnoticed."
"Mary of Hudson, ma",3/12/2012,,"I was charged for a tech to come out and fix my cable due to defective equipment. Unbelievable! Iâ€™m on hold for 30 minutes just to speak with a manager and thereâ€™s no help. Theyâ€™re saying too bad, not their fault. Not only that, they blew my TV one year earlier for not grounding the wires in the basement when they first installed cable at my house."
"Vicki of Woodbridge, NJ",3/13/2012,,"I've had Comcast at my current address for the last 16 yrs. Comcast is charging me for movies that were never ordered. This has been going on for the last 3 months. Comcast had their research dept look into this issue and have credited me for the last 2 months, but are refusing to credit me the $400+ in recently charged films. The movies in question are adult films (porn) which was not ordered by me or anyone else. I've changed the modem and cable boxes twice. I also have a block on every TV along with a required pin code in order to get anything on demand. I have no children and there is no way anyone can be ordering this from inside my house. I'm a breast cancer survivor, fighting to regain my health and my life. I'm a good person and I do for others. How could this be happening to me? Please help."
"Patricia of Ruckersville Va 22968, VA",3/13/2012,,"I received a flyer in the mail about Xfinity and I called to get some information on prices. I spoke with a salesperson, who gave me some good information and all the prices, which add in as the $139.99 package deal. She took my phone number and social security number trying see how long it would take to get the phone number to report over to Comcast from Century Link. She stated that she had to do something with her computer and would call me back. She never called back, so I called Comcast back and received a different person. All the information that the first salesperson has told me was incorrect. I was told by the first lady that there are no charge for installation and would have three movie channels and double the internet speed. When calling back, I would have to get a lower package with less program, which allows paying for an extra TV, installation and no movie channel. I'm not a customer yet and this was how I was treated. Don't go to Comcast."
"Elizabeth of bldg 3 Apt 23, MA",3/13/2012,,"I had Comcast installed on October 14, 2011. I was told that if I kept my account in good standing, I would receive a $100 gift card within 6-8 weeks after my first 90 days. On March 5, 2011, I called to see when my gift card should be arriving. I spoke with the customer rep and she told me that it is in the mail and I should receive it by the end of the week. If not, call them back on the 12th. So I called back on the 12th and spoke to another rep who said it was in my records that I called but no info about my card. I was then sent to the rebate department. I was told there that Comcast never sent over the information and no card was even in the process of being sent. I had to call back and asked to speak to a supervisor. I was told it would take another 6-8 weeks for my card and she was not sure why I was told it was in the mail. I asked what they are going to do about this. She told me that she would send a note to the supervisor of the rep who told me it was in the mail and I would get a call back today 3-12-12. Well, thereâ€™s no call back. I told the supervisor that I was not the type of person to write things down. I would never have gotten my gift card and Comcast would not have mailed it out to me and I would be out the $100. Can you imagine all the people out there that have forgotten about this gift card? I am more angry that I was lied to and no one even cared enough to call me back and try to explain what happened. My contract ends on October 14, 2013 and I will not renew my contract with Comcast. I want and need answers to what happened. I pay over $150 a month to this company and they could care less about there customers. Itâ€™s not a very good way to get new or keep old customers. Thank you."
"Ernest  of Jacksonville, FL",3/13/2012,,"I noticed an increase in my bill, called to inquire and was told that an increase was due for that month and beyond. I stated that I wanted to reduce my service and avoid any higher monthly cost. I was placed on hold, transferred from to another representative, placed on hold again.After about thirty minutes, I called again, was placed on hold (ignored) again. Two of the representatives' names were Chris and Yalonda. After more than an hour and twenty minutes on the phone (holding), I never received any satisfaction. Comcast has earned a notorious reputation for disrespect and disregard for their customers."
"THOMAS of Purvis, ms",3/14/2012,,"I placed an order for two telephone lines, internet service and TV. When the tech came, he only installed the phone lines and internet. I proceeded to tell him we also ordered TV. He said it was not on the work order. I then showed him the contract, which stated that I had also ordered TV services, of which he replied, ""It doesn't matter. I can't do anything if itâ€™s not on my work order."" I called the rep, who initially signed me up for service, and he said it was on the work order all the time. The tech refused to show me what his work order said, so I was told they would return and finish the install. At 5 pm, I called again and they told me that someone had called me and that I had said ""tomorrow would be fine"". I never received a call from Comcast and I was by the telephone the whole time. They simply lied! I still do not have TV service and I am not going to pay for something I do not have! The integrity of Comcast is very questionable. If you have had similar problems, we should get together and do our part as consumers to hold this major company to a higher standard of conducting business!"
"Duffy  of Chicago, IL",3/14/2012,,"I live in a building that has Comcast service already set up for basic cable. I called into Comcast on 03/08/12 to set up service and get all the equipment. I was told that I would be charged $120.00 to have someone come install the service and only $5.00 to have the equipment shipped out to me in 3 to 5 days. I was moving a number from RCN to Comcast and had to do third party verification to allow the transfer of the number. I did this at the end of my 30 min call to set up service.After a couple of days I realized that I had not received any emails from Comcast, so I called back in. They told me that the 3rd party verification did not go through and I would have to do it again. I did it then on-line and also did it over the phone again. One more time, I received another call that the verification did not go through, so I attempted again.Today, I called in to see if everything is okay and they have cancelled my order because the verification did not go through. Day 6, no equipment and now no order. I called in and was transferred 4 times. I was told I had three options after setting this account up again. I could wait 5 days for the equipment to arrive. I could go to a center and pickup the equipment; however, they may not have the right equipment so I may have to call back and get the equipment mailed or I could have a service appointment set up. If I have someone bring the equipment out, I would have to pay $70.00 to have this done. No one would help me. I have already received a $5.00 bill and now had to wait on hold so they could call over to billing to have it removed. It is costing me about $25.00 in cab fare to get this equipment. Also, I may get to this facility and they could be out of stock and may have to wait! Unreal!I work for the condo association and I will do everything in my power to get this cancelled out with Comcast. In the meantime, I have to set up service with you as I need internet and phone more than anything for work. It is amazing to me that I was offered nothing for spending 3 hours, 6 days and money to get around to do a job that the cable company should be doing. Unfortunately, since you have the contract with the building I have to have your services which are outdated DVRs and poor customer service. I was basically told that RCN and the verification were the problem and there is nothing that you can do. I will tell this story to anyone that listens as your company is on my top 5 worst to deal with!"
"Ricky of Normal, IL",3/15/2012,,"We had Comcast back in 2008 and part of 2009. It started out as an okay service. The internet was slow and we were told we had the best they had. For about eight months, the bill was what it was to be then we got a bill for over $600. We called them. They put us on hold for a good 30 minutes then came back and said it was a mistake and it would be fixed. The next month came and the bill was over $600 again. I called and was told there was nothing they could do, that we had to pay it or we would be cut off. We did not pay it. Now, our landlord pays for the cable (Comcast) and they're doing the same crap to him and we still get bills from Comcast for stuff the landlord pays. It's ** and now my mom has no phone or net and they're telling her that they can't get anyone out there until Friday. They were rude to her on the phone and there was no manager to talk to her. There was no way to file a complaint. My grandmother lives with her and my aunt and she has that Life Alert so if something happens, they won't be able to call for help. The customer rep told her, ""I can't help you. There is nothing we can do."" We all need to get together and get this company shut down. They are scammers."
"Rebecca of Tamarac, FL",3/16/2012,,"Lawn contractors are angry with TV cable being over the ground for over a year. They cannot maintain the lawn in that area due to a large sign posted by a good Samaritan stating, ""Danger: Over the ground cable.â€ The lawn contractors saw me outside and asked me to personally bury the cable. I told them that I couldn't, but would call for repair. I've spent a total of at least two hours combined repeating the same information to Comcast where each appointment is closed for unknown reasons. I attempted again today where I probed as to why the problem has not been fixed. I was told that I must be home and answer the phone on the day of attempted repair and if I do not, the case is closed. First, I have ""privacy director"" on my phone and if the repair person doesn't follow the instructions by identifying him self, I cannot get the call. I can tell you that I believe that a repair person will not extend himself to identify and wait for an answer, as well as I keep repeating that the cable is in a common area. I don't even know if it affect my home's TV service and that I am just trying to solve a problem that has fallen in my lap. The lawn service does not seem to understand that I am an innocent person in this scenario, but in fact think I am a horrible person and I am kind of scared to be home when they are maintaining the area. Comcast, now Xfinity, has a web page that claims to have simple easy solutions to problem solving and has thousands of words written on a huge page. But after reading the entire page, I have two choices: online help, which they told me I need to call; and then calling, which I have done repeatedly."
"Steven of Harrisonburg, VA",3/16/2012,,"Since we have gotten the adapters that we must use with our cable service, our picture has been distorted. These boxes negate the service that we should be getting from Xfinity/Comcast as well as the capabilities of our sets. We are told that we will now need an additional digital box at $9.99 per month in order to get the quality of service that we previously had. I think this should be illegal and, at the very least, unethical. This, combined with the overall service of Xfinity, needs to be addressed."
"Darryl of Unit-15, IL",3/16/2012,,Picture is pixelating throughout HD channels. Screen freezing has been going on for eight months. I'm on the 12th service call for technician to come out. My neighbor is having same issue. I also have to deal with rude associates when calling in about on going problem.
"tanysha of Sacramento, CA",3/17/2012,,Comcast released my bill and info to my landlord. A copy of my bill was faxed without my permission. I called Comcast to complain to a supervisor. I was basically told that I don't have any say and that my landlord has a right to get any info on my bill without my permission. I do not think this is fair at all and I feel like my privacy has been violated.
"Angie of 188 Lewis St, NM",3/18/2012,,"Iâ€™m a daughter and I am complaining about Comcast. One thing is that my parents enjoy Comcast and all the features but every time they get the bill, itâ€™s over $600 when it is not even supposed to be that much, near that much. But also, it hurts me because when my mom has it on speaker and my mom says, â€œCan I pay buy Thursday,â€ when itâ€™s Monday. Then the reply goes, â€œNope, we canâ€™t help you,â€ and hangs up. That gets me mad so we're canceling Comcast and getting a not so expensive internet and TV because that is ** and is getting way to out of control. So we need lots of people to complain about Comcast to shut the internet and cable down!"
"Bobbie of Arlington, VA",3/19/2012,,"Friday, March 16, 2012, I spoke to 4 people regarding the slow speed regarding my internet. I am unable to retrieve my emails, including accessing the internet. I requested to speak to a supervisor. One of the 4 people was supervisor Joe. He put me in touch with technician Robert who scheduled a technician come out to my home Monday, March 16 between the hours of 3 pm and 6 pm. The day before, Sunday, March 18th, I received an automated confirmation phone call. Leaving work early, I arrived home at 1 pm and waited at home for the rest of the day. The technician never phoned nor showed up! My records will show that I am an excellent customer who has been with Comcast for more than 6 years. I live in a condominium building of 295 units. Half of my building has left Comcast and have transferred their service to Verizon. I am appalled by the poor service I received from Comcast."
"Wanita of Bellingham, WA",3/19/2012,,"In January 2011, I added Internet To Go to my services through Comcast Cable for use while traveling in our Motorhome. I already had a TV and Wired High Speed Internet service through them. When I signed up, I had to purchase their portable modem, but I signed a year service contract to avoid an activation fee.In January or February of this year, that is approximately 2 months ago, my service contract was up and we were not traveling. I called Comcast to inquire about the service going forward. I explained that we were not traveling right now, so were not using the Internet To Go service at that time. I asked if I could discontinue the service and reactivate it when we were again traveling and if I would need to sign another 1 year agreement. The sales representative said that I needed to call back because my contract hadn't expired yet but that yes I could re-activate it when we needed it again and that it would be month to month. So I called back on the date they told me and deactivated it and again made sure I could re-activate it month to month.Yesterday, March 28, I called to re-activate it, that is less than 2 months later, and I was told the service is no longer available to anyone who wasn't currently paying for it because they had signed a new service agreement with Verizon to supply Internet To Go. Quite frankly I was not happy. I would never had discontinued the service if I had been told I could not sign up again. Now I have a useless portable modem and no way to connect to the Internet while traveling. I have spoken to someone from another wireless company who said they always inform their customers who are making changes to their service if that service will not be available to them should they want it again and if the price will increase.Comcast is treating their Internet To Go customers very badly. Comcast has supplied my family with cable TV service for over 20 years and high speed Internet for as long as I can remember having Internet service. But now, I will be looking elsewhere for the services."
"Marcia of Humble, TX",3/19/2012,,"We were told we would have to have boxes in order for our TV to work even though they are new flat screens. When you hook them up to regular cable, it is snow, so then they tried the adapters and they would not work. It is funny, the only thing that seemed to work are the boxes that are $9.99 a month. I called to see what I can do about getting them cheaper and they said not a thing. So now I am waiting on a supervisor to call and on top of that, they gave us a new account number since the main account holder passed away and we did not have phone service for over a week. It took them forever to fix it since the phone number was in space, they said. They also asked if we could bring the guy who passed away down and we said OK, we will bring the ashes. What idiot person would ask that? Comcast is a bunch of crap."
"Bonnie of Mount Joy, PA",3/19/2012,,"I recently tried to rent a 5 dollar movie for my niece, nephew, and daughter when they were having a sleep over. Well, I was 11 days late on my bill. Comcast, bills a month ahead of time so they added next month's bill on top of that, even though I haven't even entered the time frame for that billing service. So when I called I was told I am thirty days late on my bill and cannot order the movie. I hadn't even received my new bill in the mail yet, but because they charged my account, they said I am considered to be 30 days late on my payment. I was not even late enough for them to charge me a late fee but I am late enough for them to charge me for services I have yet to use and refuse to allow me to rent a 5 dollar movie. When I called they said there is nothing they could do that it is all automated. I have had service with Comcast for a number of years and never had an issue with them before. I wish I had another choice for service in my area but I do not. I think it is ** that they can charge me for something I haven't even used, but I can spend another 5 dollars for a movie. They should not be able to charge me for services I have not used and someone needs to do something about it."
"Elma of Potomac, MD",3/20/2012,,"I moved house last February 15, 2012. Prior to the move, I called to terminate my cable/Phone/Internet with Comcast. I was advised to return the following items: 2 receivers and the modem. My husband paid all the unpaid bills so that we can transfer the service to the other home. I then went to Comcast Gude Drive office to return all the equipment they asked, 2 receivers and 1 modem box, and in fact, I also returned 2 remote controls. I made sure to go and return these items myself to make sure that they were really returned. After one month, I get a bill from Comcast for $299.95. I called to question this bill, but no one seemed to know which department can help me. I was passed around into different departments, and the last person I spoke with, hanged up on me when I said I could barely hear her because her voice seemed so far away. So today, 3/19/2012, I drove to Comcast again, lined up like the rests of the people and waited patiently for my turn. The gentleman who helped ( thank god he was very nice), told me the items were not returned so he gave me a breakdown of the bill ($164.00 for the receivers, $80.00, and $55.65 for an additional charge for keeping the service on the other house).My husband said the bill from the other house was already fully paid and he has a receipt for it. He said he can take out the $164.00 charges for receivers that were not returned, but not the $80.00 for the modem. I told him my story, but he said he cannot do anything about it. He needs the receipt to show I returned them. But won't their system show the transaction? He said there was an activity, but he won't tell me exactly what they were. Why would he give me a credit for the receivers and not the modem if his computer says I did not return anything? Why would the system show that I was there that day if I did not return anything? I wouldn't simply waste my time lining up, waiting for a period of time, if I did not have a purpose! Because I did return all 3 items and now they're telling me and charging me for the items that were not returned, it's all a lie!This is all unfair! I think it is money making gimmick! How in the world did this happen, when I, personally brought those items and saw the man logged it in his computer, said everything is done and gave me the receipt. I can't find my receipt at this point, I am not sure if I kept it or maybe misplaced it during the move. But in all honesty, they have the items and I am being charged for it! I feel cheated and treated unfairly! I do not owe Comcast anything, please somebody help me! I told the Comcast representative that it is not a million dollars to pay, but the principle of it all, that I went and returned the items and now I am being told I did not! How can they employ people like these to handle these transactions and leave their costumers in so much grief!"
"Richard  of Miami , FL",3/20/2012,,"Comcast no show up for appointments - I'm very angry I have no phone and cable at my house. I'm a value triple play customer. I took the day off last Friday waiting for the technician on a set appointment and they cancelled the appointment without going to my house. They said they cancelled because they called and nobody answered the call. Again, my Comcast phone is not working! I had no phone for the last two weeks! I called on Friday and they apologized and gave me a $20 credit and reschedule another appointment for today between 11am and 1pm and again, they made the same mistake! Thank you, Comcast, another day wasted! I'm very angry! I wish there was an attorney out there who can help me on all this."
"William of West Chicago, IL",3/21/2012,,Bad reception - Digital is not what was to be expected. Many shows missed due to no reception.
"Erin of St Paul, MN",3/23/2012,,"In December of 2011, I made the decision to move up to broadband from dial up. The Comcast install rep installed things and once up, he commented on how slow my computer was, suggesting that I disable certain functions on my computer to improve speed. I did not do this, as I didn't have enough knowledge of what each function did to mess around with that.After using the new service for a bit, I went to Comcast's website and noticed they had a download available, which said ""optimize your computer for Comcast"" or something to that effect. I'm very cautious about downloading anything, so I called Comcast twice to verify that the site was indeed theirs and asked if it was safe to download. Both reps said yes, with the second one verifying the web address I provided was Comcast's.Later that night, I was no longer able to connect to the internet. I noticed certain programs were missing. Slowly, everything on my computer was wiped out. Fortunately, I had backed up my files, but now my computer is useless. I tried reinstalling after a long search to find the product key, but none of the drivers work, except for the CD. Modems aren't recognized. All the programs I had are gone. As stated, I was very cautious about downloading things. I had only had my computer crash once before and that was when I first got it and started using the internet. The first day I got broadband from Comcast, I got a virus from the download on their site and my computer crashed.I called Comcast and requested to speak to a local supervisor. I spoke with Patti and she herself stated that it was definitely the link on their site that caused my computer to crash. She said she was going to look into some things. I called her again and she said it was being processed as a damage claim and that I should call her back by about mid January 2012 if I didn't hear from her. I didn't hear from her and called her back, only to get her voice mail. I called a few more times, getting her voice mail every time, and let her know I would be suing the company if I didn't receive compensation for my computer. I have not been able to pursue this due to lack of enough money to file a case in civil court.Up until today, March 23rd, my mother had not received her monthly bills. We assumed this was how Comcast was reimbursing me for my computer. We found out differently. There came a bill in the amount of $400. My mother called the regular Comcast line and explained the situation. She asked if they could allow her to pay the bill in increments until she could get caught up. They refused and said if she didn't pay they were going to cancel service. Someone from Comcast kept calling about the bill. I called and told the rep I spoke to, not to call anymore or we would sue for harassment, explaining that this was already discussed with another rep. She continued to argue with me, even when I told her about the do not call law.I called Patti, the supervisor I had spoken with, and told her again that I would take Comcast to court for the damage to my computer and told her (again, via voice mail) about the situation with the billing issues. I explained that my mother had been a customer for 30 years and how despicable it was, that both she and I had to deal with this. I'm not holding my breath waiting for her to call, much less resolve this. I have these conversations recorded and explained to Patti when I spoke with her in December, that I was recording any conversations I had with the company. "
"Mary of Indianapolis, IN",3/23/2012,,"I was a Comcast customer for several years. I was pleased until this last year. I was promised a low rate, but it was not honored. When I called to talk about it, I was told they didn't get that email. I was told I had to pay the larger amount. I told them if they billed me at the much higher rate one more month, I would no longer be a customer. They billed me at the higher rate, so I am no longer a customer. I have been trying to take back their equipment. I took back the DVR and modem. I was told I had another DVR and modem. I went home and found another DVR and modem and went to return it. The lady at the counter was the rudest woman I have ever dealt with in my life. She scanned the DVR and said it wasn't in my name. I said I don't understand why it wouldn't have been in my name. She refused to even discuss this with me and wouldn't give me a receipt. I kept telling her ""you need to give me a receipt"". She finally threw it at me. When I got to my car, I noticed the receipt didn't have my name on it. She also didn't list the modem I returned. I then called Comcast and after being on hold several times, the lady simply said ""I will let them know your concerns"" then started off with ""you owe us this money"". I will never, ever have Comcast again. No one seems to know what anyone else is doing and I have never been treated as rudely as I was today. I don't understand why the DVR wasn't in my name. I do remember having one stop working correctly and traded it for a new one. I am guessing there must have been a mess up there. There needs to be new laws. More companies should be allowed to offer cable and internet, then maybe they won't be so horrible to their customers."
"Lisa of Nolensville, TN",3/24/2012,,"I have been a Comcast customer for several years. In February, I placed an order to move my service to my new house. The new service was activated on Saturday, March 3. I had several issues with my cable, but they have now been resolved. I continue to have issues with internet, more specifically, my Comcast email. When the new service was activated, the Comcast installer did not bring a router. We could not get wireless to work with the Comcast router that I brought with me from my previous residence. I was instructed to call Comcast to order a router, which I did. It arrived about 4 days later and I activated it according to the directions. Everything was fine for a couple of days. Then my email no longer worked. It did not work at my home, it did not work on my Blackberry and it did not work when I took my laptop with me to Starbucks, etc. I called Comcast only to discover that they had shut my email addresses down. Apparently, the move order did not include (although I made a point of requesting) the transfer of my email addresses and they had been cancelled. During this call, I was assured they could turn my emails back on and that it would take about 48 hours. True to their word, I had email again in approximately 48 hours. But about 24 hours later, problems started. This was on or about Thursday, March 15. I could log in to my Comcast email account, but when I attempted to open any of my emails, I got an error message stating that the webpage could not be displayed. I tried my second laptop and the same thing happened. I called Comcast and was informed that I had problems with my laptop and was instructed to follow directions to reset my browser and other things specific to my laptop. It did not help on either of my laptops. My first call about this problem ended with no resolution. I decided the next day to take my laptop to Starbucks. I was able to log in and open all of my emails at Starbucks, so I called Comcast when I returned home. Now on March 17, to explain that the problem probably was not my laptop since I did not have the problem except at my residence, it was then suggested that I needed a new (another new router since the ones I was using was only a few days old) router/modem. It was shipped via expedited shipping and it arrived on Wednesday, March 21. Once again, I installed and activated the new modem/router and even with the new router, I continued to have the same problem. I called Comcast and was eventually told that a ticket had been issued to bump up my case to national (?), another level of customer service, and that I would get a call within 24 hours. I did not get the call and so tonight, Friday, March 23, I called Comcast again. I was told, after being instructed to reset my browser, which I opted not to do because I do not trust Comcast to fix anything and do not feel good about following any instructions that mess with my equipment, that the case follow-up phone call did not have a deadline until Saturday, March 24. I opted to end my call to Comcast at that time and waited for the call on Saturday, March 24. I am beyond frustrated over the problem and Comcast's inability to fix my problem. When you look at the entire process of the activation of my service since March 3, it has been an absolute disaster."
"Larry of Memphis, TN",3/24/2012,,"My phone, TV and internet service is so weak that it continually loses it's signal, is totally interrupted and disconnects service. I have called Comcast and have been promised 4 different appointments this week. No one has shown up for any of the scheduled appointments. This is the worst service ever, FCC should decommission them."
"Misty of Gig Harbor, WA",3/24/2012,,"I am a customer of 6 months with Comcast and signed up for a 2 year agreement. I was supposed to get a prepaid visa card of $250.00 for being a new customer and signing a 2 year agreement. I have the triple play package. I have paid $2,300.00 in 6 months. My agreement was suppose to come to $229.00 per month. There is always extra charges my whole home DVR freezes up and the phone is so static I canâ€™t talk on it.I call and complain and they want to charge me to come and fix their broken equipment. They came 1 time to fix problems and the tech said it was hooked up wrong from the 1st tech that came out. He fixed some problems then different issues came up. I called and they basically tell me, so what! And they wonâ€™t send me my prepaid visa. I am on hold for long amounts of time. I cannot stand this company and I am stuck in this contract. Their motto is customer guarantee and they do not stand by that. I get so upset every time I talk to them because I pay so much money and the attitude is they donâ€™t care and itâ€™s my problem to take my broken equipment in. "
"Kenneth of Mount Dora, FL",3/24/2012,,I recently purchased 2 TiVo receivers for my Comcast service and I have expanded my service level with Comcast. The first TiVo was finally activated after trying to do it myself and three service calls. The second TiVo has yet to get activated after 3 tech visits. The last tech advised that he could not help and he would have a manager (or similar) contact me. Comcast has a serious problem that they are pushing aside while I cannot complete my transition from satellite TV - double the cost and it is costing me unnecessary expense.
"RICHARD of Boca raton, fl",3/25/2012,,"Several months ago, unfortunately, I upgraded my Comcast service agreement to include telephone service. Doing so required a different modem and rather than renting the modem from Comcast, I opted to buy a modem. This modem required a Comcast technician to install and the installation was completed. Shortly thereafter, within 30 days, I began to experience internet problems - getting knocked off and/or not being able to log on. Once again, a technician came to my home, tested the entire system and concluded my purchased modem was at fault. A Comcast modem was installed and I returned the purchased modem for a replacement. When that modem arrived, another Comcast technician was called to install.For a short time, everything functioned properly. Then my phone service stopped working on March 19, 2012. I immediately called and reported the problem and was transferred to tech support, who determined that the modem phone function was not working and needed to be replaced. I shared with the technician that I also had no internet service. I was transferred back to customer care. I was told the earliest appointment available was for March 23 between 3:00 and 5:00. I screamed and yelled to no avail. Since I could not receive or make phone calls using Comcast, I provided customer service my cellular number for purposes of confirming the appointment.At 5:30 on March 23, I again contacted Comcast and was told the service technician called and there being no answer, cancelled the appointment. Of course, the call was made to my home phone number, not the cellular number. Again, Comcast was apologetic but could not provide a technician until March 27 between 11:00 and 1:00. But I was assured that someone would call me in an attempt to expedite service. No call was received, so the next day, I re-contacted Comcast and reminded them that my cellular number, not my home phone number, should be used to confirm the appointment. Now I wait to experience another disappointment. Something must be done. A strong message must be delivered to Comcast."
"Leann of Plymouth, MA",3/26/2012,,"I manage my husband's solo pediatric practice. Reliable phone and internet service are critical for our patients. Comcast is responsible for our phones and internet and it is very unreliable! On a busy Monday morning, like this morning, the phones go down for 30 minutes and Comcast can't tell us why. Worse, they do nothing to keep it from happening again. I pay for service that I don't get. I want Comcast to fix the problems so that phone and internet are reliable. "
"Urania of None, FL",3/26/2012,,"For being a loyal customer for over 3 years, Comcast treated me really bad. I tried to add more services through Comcast, and by doing that, I end up without services and a huge bill in less than 3 weeks. And I'm still waiting on them to correct my bill and cancel my services. When I called, they hung up on me. I don't want your services anymore ever!"
"Sue of Missouri City, TX",3/26/2012,,"A Comcast rep called me one night offering a bundle of internet and cable. She said if I decided not to keep the plan, I could revert back to my current plan within 30 days. I explained I had an old AOL plan that was $30 something dollars a month. She told me it would go back to exactly the plan I already have. The conversation was recorded by the way.I called Comcast today and said I wanted to cancel the new service and go back to my original plan. They said I could not go back to the old plan. They now want to charge me double for what I already have. "
"elaine of Key Colony Beach, FL",3/26/2012,,"In January 2012, I was advised by Comcast to pick up small boxes so our cable would work. I stood in line at the Marathon, FL office for three hours. I lost over half our channels after attaching the boxes. I upgraded the service from basic (2-25) to (2-70) digital economy by adding an additional box. I found out later that only the one TV with the new box would have the upper channels. I've never heard of paying for cable TV on one TV and not the others in the home. Subsequently, I cancelled the upgrade. I was told for an additional $10 per TV/per month, we could have the upper channels. This is so bizarre to me since I have another home in Ohio and when we get cable TV for our home, it works on all TVs in the home. I think Comcast is gouging customers and feel this is extremely unfair."
"David of Fort Lauderdale, FL",3/27/2012,,Outages happen but Comcast's dismal failure to quickly update a call to inquire why service is out magnifies the problem. A quick message at 1-800-Comcast acknowledging a problem ensures customers that they are working on it. It took Comcast 34 minutes to answer my call. And Comcast owns NBC. I think Comcast owes customers prompt service. We understand outages happen but not sloppy customer service.
"Rebecca of Seattle, WA",3/28/2012,,"When I switched to Comcast last August, I was supposed to receive a $250.00 Visa gift card. It would take 4-6 weeks for processing. It has been almost eight months and I still haven't received anything but the run around and several credits for poor customer service. There was a problem with the billing every month and every month I would ask about the Visa gift card, only to be told the coding wasn't done correctly or wasnâ€™t on the account at all. After being told month after month that the Visa gift card coding on the account hadn't been done correctly, a supervisor gave out someoneâ€™s home phone number when I requested a contact number for Visa. Elisa at Comcast assured me the end of December the Visa gift card was on its way. Then I received confirmation emails from Agatha **, but I still don't have a gift card. I called Elisa beginning of March and left messages for two weeks with no return call. I followed it up with an email and now no one seems to remember my account information. I've received several emails from the executive customer care team for Comcast's Washington market that sound like a blow off. This is fraud and false advertising. I don't care how many unasked for credits they apply to my accountâ€”I would like the $250 Visa gift card that was part of the original package."
"Cathy of Washington, DC",3/28/2012,,"Many months ago, I signed up for Comcast Extreme 50 internet service and am billed at $100 per month. When the internet is working (which it often doesn't), I have never got the speeds they promised me. Best speeds are (via ethernet cable i.e. wired) 9-13Mbs download and 4Mbs upload. Service is often so slow, it times out. Repeated visits by technicians who tested it and said it was not their area of expertise and someone else would come to fix the issue. At their recommendation, I have purchased a new modem and upgraded both my router and adapter. Repeated appointments made with Comcast and technicians failed to arrive. One technician determined that cables from the Comcast box in building to my unit need replacing, as do the cables within my unit. Repeated complaints to Comcast technicians and still, the issue is not fixed. When I threatened to go public via social media, they sent someone out to replace the cables from the box to my unit, but the guy said he couldn't replace the other cables as he ""didn't have white cable only black"". He told me someone would contact me within 48 hours to come and replace the rest of the cabling. A week later, and nothing. Comcast refuses to lower my bill while I am not getting the correct speeds, and insists I continue to pay full price for a service which I am not getting. Unfortunately, Comcast has a lock on the downtown DC area, including this building, and no other provider is able to service this building to provide internet services. Still, that does not give them the authority to charge for a service that they are unable to provide. "
"Traci of Missouri City , TX",3/28/2012,,"Negligence/Mishandling of Personal Data in Identity Theft Claim - In December of 2011, it was brought to my attention that a Comcast cable account was opened in Houston, Texas under my previous name and Social Security number. It is a fraudulent account; therefore, I immediately began processing the necessary paperwork required by Comcast, each credit bureau and the collections agency holding the now delinquent account. The collections agency provided me with a number for Comcast's Fraud Department (866-225-2677), which is a recording that instructs you on how to process a fraud claim. On March 7, 2012, I sent a police report, FTC reference number, a copy of my driver's license and two utility bills for proof of identity to fax number **. Additionally, I've left multiple messages with no returned calls. After expressing my concerns via Comcast's customer service line, I was told to endure yet another fraudulent claims process. I verbally provided the necessary information and was told that I would receive a call back no later than Tuesday, March 27, 2012. Apparently, a fraud packet was to be sent out as well. Once again, I did not receive a call. Upon follow-up today, March 28th, I've learned the fraud phone number provided to me by the collections agency is an old Comcast number. Since no one can determine whether the number is forwarded to a new number or simply an unmanned number, I have no idea where my voicemails were left nor do I know the locale of the faxed documents I sent. To add more insult to injury, Comcast sent their fraud packet to the address where the fraudulent account was opened.I am now back at square one and have to resubmit a new set of documentation. In the meantime, I receive weekly calls from the collections agency and will until Comcast contacts them with an update on the account. In essence, I am of the opinion that Comcast has been negligent in many regards and has exhibited a total disregard of timeliness and due diligence in this matter. I expect better handling of my personal data given the sensitivity of this matter, the documents I've sent to who knows where and now the documents that Comcast has sent to would-be suspects. Thank you for your time."
"Steve Ryan of Mt. Pleasant, SC",3/28/2012,,"We moved into a new place almost a year ago and they showed up two days before our scheduled time to install the cable and modem (No TV's or computer there yet). The tech said that I could either let him install the boxes and modem with no TVs or computer or reschedule the appointment, in which they didn't have anything available for three weeks. Since day 1, we have been on the phone with them, gone to the Comcast office in person and have gotten nowhere. The on demand has never worked. We have had lines running up the TV screen and when they did the box conversion, we lost a whole bunch of channels on our other TV. If I had known how bad they were going to be, I would have just went without cable, period! Every time you call them, you wait on hold forever and then they can't help you with your problem. Comcast is supposed to be customer orientated but that is a load of **. As long as they get their money, they do not care. I am sorry I ever heard of Comcast!"
"Cynthia Marie of Nashville, TN",3/29/2012,,"I contacted you back in November or December 2011, with issues of overcharges by Comcast for services that were not provided. This has continued, despite numerous calls to Comcast to straighten it out. I downgraded my services, as well, and am still being charged.First, I have been charged every month for DVR service, since as far back as I can find bills (January 2011). I don't have DVR service, I don't have the equipment. Second, I am being charged for a top-tier of services, including multiple channels, which I do not have access to, and that includes the DVR, telephone (which has been disconnected completely) and high-speed internet. Third, I received the lowest level of cable TV and internet, and was quoted a monthly cost for both of less than $70 plus taxes and fees. My last two month's bills have both been over $140. Lastly, I have called, emailed, and ""chatted"" for approximately 20 hours since January about these issues, and nothing changed. Well, they did disconnect my phone but two weeks earlier than requested and they are still charging me for having the service.You might ask why I continue with Comcast, itâ€™s because there are no other providers that I can obtain service with. I live in a high-rise apartment, and have been told by Dish, DirecTV and AT&T that since the management has a contract with these providers, the individual tenants cannot obtain individual service. The management does not provide any of these services, whether at cost or free, to any individual tenant, but it still prohibits other companies from making a contract with individuals. My only choice to receive TV and Internet is via Comcast. Thankfully, I've been able to get limited cell phone use and cancel Comcast phone to save some money.Comcast now charges for any technical support, and debited my bank account without my permission for a down payment of ""Xfinity Support"" that has been credited back. However, the monthly charge for this technical support appears on the bills I receive as well. I thought this was taken care of, but depending on what day I look at my bill, the $39 charge is there some months, not there some months, but the bills are still too high for what I have purchased from Comcast. Why is it that cities smaller than Nashville have multiple cable providers, but Comcast/Intermedia/Viacom/ whatever they've been called, remains the sole cable provider in Nashville, TN. I thought there were laws keeping monopolies like this from happening. In any case, I'd appreciate it if you'd help me straighten out the bills from January 2012 forward to only show the service I have received. Thank you."
"Barbara of Crofton, MD",3/29/2012,,"My new next door neighbor (condo) subscribed to Comcast and the serviceperson switched mine in error. Then, I also found her box and switched her. However, mine was never returned to my Verizon. I had to have Verizon come out and repair the damage to the box and wiring. I called Comcast at least 6 times with no return call from any person. They are responsible for paying for the mess that they made and I want this to be resolved ASAP. I would never recommend Comcast to anyone as they are totally incompetent. I want my $98.70 that they owe me."
"Renee of Tamarac, FL",3/29/2012,,"Well, I cancelled my cable service with Comcast because it got to be too expensive and told them not to cancel my internet. So, they cancelled the internet 5 minutes after they left. They were supposed to come out yesterday. After calling them, they told me they tried calling my house number (which I told them that's the house number which is through the internet), and to call my cell number. Do you think they did? Nope. I gave the cell number to 4 different people. They have a bunch of incompetent fools working for them. So, today they rescheduled to come to my house between 9-11. They showed up at 10:30. They do not care about their customers. This has to be the most horrible experience I ever had in my life. They gave me a $20 credit for yesterday and they are giving me internet for $19.99/month for 6 months. When this is done, I'll be changing my service."
"John of Lilburn, GA",3/29/2012,,"Itâ€™s necessary to change cable box to digital service. When the box was connected, it disabled the other box on the TV in the bedroom. After trips to Comcast and 4 and 1/2 hours later, itâ€™s still unresolved. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told the supervisor would not talk to me. I asked the person on the phone if she was speaking for the supervisor and she said yes. This is the most poorly run organization I have ever dealt with. There is no such thing as customer service. Bottom line: they don't care about the customer and it shows every time you have to deal with them."
"Edward of Delray beach, fl 33484, fl",3/30/2012,,"The Comcast guarantee states that if not 100% satisfied, return the equipment before thirty days and money paid will be refunded. I had difficulties with the DVR and channels several times and contacted customer service with absolutely no help. I returned the equipment prior to the 30-day stated time period and was told by the woman at the desk, who reviewed my account, that I would receive a check shortly. The office in question is on Federal Highway, (US 1) Boca Raton/Delray Beach, FL. When no check was forthcoming, I called customer service by phone on three different occasions. I was told that the tech did not arrive at the location to disconnect the service until two days after the 30-day time limit, so I was not entitled to the refund.First, after researching your so-called ""guarantee"", it clearly fails to state this ridiculous inclusion of a tech physically disconnecting the service. Incredulous! What concern is it of mine how your techs are managed in the field and when they arrive to physically disconnect the service? Second, this one is truly ** as how could I use the service when the equipment was returned to a Comcast location? Who runs this company, Donald Duck? I want the refund due to me (approximately $139.00) ASAP. This fiasco took place in December, so I'm sure you can understand my anger. Unless you'd prefer me to continue this complaint to newspapers, federal agencies, BBB and FTC included, I suggest you remedy this mistake while you can.I will be your worst nightmare continuing this line of complaints including posting a sign at your local offices explaining the fallacy of your word to guarantee your service. Get on it and solve this ASAP. As you may have noticed, I'm not your standard everyday mindless customer and have attorneys in the family who would love to visit Philadelphia. Thanks for your ""guaranteed"" assistance."
"Jacqueline S of Spring, TX",3/30/2012,,"Late for Service Calls: Comcast scheduled a service tech to my address on Thursday, 29 Mar 2012, between 07:30 AM and 08:30 AM. The service tech was an hour and 15 minutes late and didn't install the additional line in a back bedroom that was requested on the initial work order that I placed on Wednesday, 28 March 2012. No one from Comcast called to advise me that the service rep would be an hour and a half late. I had to contact Comcast to inquire as to what happened and why the service tech was not on time. Comcast offered to send a service tech later that same day but I would have to remain at home all day to wait for a tech to arrive. I told them that I was not going to wait at home all day for a service tech to show up, especially when he didn't install the line when he did show up an hour and a half late.I asked the customer service rep to re-schedule the tech for the next day, Friday, 30 March 2012, at the same time between 7:30 AM and 8:30 AM, which she did. I got two calls before 7:30 AM to confirm that I was home and was assured that the tech would be there. I received a call at 8:33 AM on Friday, 30 March 2012, from the Comcast Dispatch stating that the tech would not be at my house until 9:45 AM, which is now 2 hours and 15 minutes late, an hour later than when he showed up on Thursday, 28 March 2012. This lateness by techs is unacceptable. I am appalled at having to wait on techs when I'm paying for their service and I shouldn't have to wait all day for a tech to show up for a pre-scheduled service call. I didn't call at the spur of the moment. I called the day before I needed the service. Management should be concerned because I'm sure that I'm not the only dissatisfied customer with this 'crappy' service that Comcast heaps on it customer. Do something about this now!"
"Christine of Douglasville, GA",3/31/2012,,"We decided to try to save money by bundling our services, so right before Christmas of 2011, I made the grave mistake by ordering Comcast! First they accidentally changed my home phone number, so I spent hours on my cell phone with them being blown off by supervisors that were supposed to be calling me back to correct that and went almost a full week with four children with no phone service. Next, the cable boxes were incorrectly installed so the TVs upstairs would shut off and not stay on (wrong cable from technician) so My kids went their full Christmas vacation with no TV. So another technician came out to fix that. This was after more hours of being blown off and never taken care of. So I had to escalate my concerns to corporate level, who took care of things for me and credited me some charges for my aggravation. Okay. Great. But not without them telling me that my bill that was supposed to be $165 a month for being a new Comcast customer is really supposed to be $195 a month.logged in for my March bill to find out a $453 bill! So I opened up my PDF bill to find out over 25 porn movies that I never ordered being charged to my account! Over $370 worth over three months! So after calling Comcast again and being blown off again, I took the boxes to the Douglasville, GA location and signed for my boxes to be returned only to have the representative drill me about how old my kids were and how they could have ordered these movies! I was like ""Really? From school?"" So then she implied that I was ordering 8 movies in a row a day from multiple TVs in my home and watching them at the same time! Oh, it gets better! I got enraged at her accusations and started defending my family's honor only to have another customer behind me yell at me telling me I was out of line! We got into a yelling match and I just left with my receipt and have filed complaints with corporate, here and over the phone on the reg 800#. Not resolve yet! Do not go to Comcast! They only care about your money! That's It! You're only a # and a payday for them!"
"Rachel of Battle Creek, MI",4/1/2012,,"On Superbowl Sunday, I first complained about the condition of the outdoor cable connection box and the spotty service. A month later (after switching to Dish network), it still wasn't fixed and my internet at $56.00 a month is still with Comcast. They told me approximately 2 weeks to get a service rep out to look at it. Third call was today 4/1. I have pictures of the broken equipment and the lawn maintenance crew is now simply mowing around the Comcast equipment that is laying all over the ground and grass. If you would like to see my pictures, email me. Comcast should be ashamed at the condition after 3 complaints that their service and equipment is in."
"John of Naples, FL",4/1/2012,,"I wanted a box with HDMI so that the Picture-in-Picture on my Vizio TV would work. I went to my local Comcast office and picked up the box which was supposedly refurbished. When I connected the box, I could not get the HDMI to work. All I got was a black screen that said â€œretrieving dataâ€. I called Comcast and got routed to the Philippines. We were able to get the box to work with the component jacks, but not the HDMI jack. It took a long time because the woman could not understand or speak proper English. I finally gave up and called again. This time I got someone who I could understand. After a while, he said he would send a technician out and there would be a service charge or I could buy a service plan which would cover it. I told him no and there was no way I would pay for a service call. He told me to take the box back. I will and I am packing a lunch and I will not leave until they give me a new box that I can see work. I hope they call the police on me because I will find a scumbag lawyer to sue them. Also, my TV was capable of receiving the HD sub-channels without a converter and now it cannot. I donâ€™t know what they have done."
"Maureen of Quincy, MA",4/2/2012,,"I called to cancel Showtime from my cable bill. My name is Maureen **. My husband Harry died in 2008. His name is on the account. Since his death, I have added internet service and premium station. In order for me to cancel Showtime, they want a death certificate. I have written every check since the 70's when we signed up for cable. I spend one and a half hours trying to get a supervisor, email address or even who to write. No one has called me back and I am totally frustrated. "
"David of Apt 200 i, GA",4/3/2012,,"I started service with the GA Comcast service in Lawrenceville. I bought my own modem from Fry's Electronics before starting service with them. All was fine with service, billing - everything at that address. I moved to Cumming, GA and that was when things went bad. First of all, the account rep put on my service order that I needed a modem after telling her several times I owned one. When the tech arrived to set up my service, he saw that I already had a modem and had it properly notated on my account, so I was not charged for it the first month (April 2011) at my current address. I made the mistake of trusting it was off the rest of the time. When my bill went up after 6 months of promo time, I logged in and looked at my bill finding the modem lease fee on my bill. I called and was told they had to escalate it and would take 2-3 weeks to get resolved. After no response for 2 months, I called back in and was told it was not resolved yet. However, it should be soon and I was welcome to stop paying for the modem as it would be credited back to my account. After 3 more months of this, I called in again. This time, I got a competent CSR who made the corrections. However, when they reactivated my service properly, somehow they entered my modem as a rental. I had to take my modem to my local office with proof of purchase to prove it was a retail, not theirs. The ladies at the office were quite helpful and put the proper notation in my account. I was told I had to call back in to corporate to have them correct the billing and listing. I did that, however, the CSR said she didn't have the authority and a supervisor would have to fix it. It got corrected without contacting me. I called back in 2 days later to find this out, but the credit for the nearly year of paying has not been taken care of. I was again told a manager had to do this and would call me within 3 business days. I told them I would register a complaint if no call within that time. Obviously, not taken care of."
"Jamie of Federal Way, WA",4/3/2012,,"After already talking to one representative, I had to call Comcast's customer service dept again. This time being connected to a representative by the name of Amy. She asked to verify information that wasn't necessary and kept rambling on about how sorry she was about everything which at this point is pissing me off even more. After voicing my frustration, she schedules for a technician to come out between 10am and noon, which after waiting around until about 12:17pm, no technician. I called back to find out what happened and I am told through the automated system and from another representative that the technician wasn't coming until later that afternoon between 1pm and 3pm. At this point, I am livid. Knowing that I still have to be to work at 2pm, I went ahead and had kept that appointment scheduled since someone would be present when they arrive.While already at work, I get a call from home saying that the technician came and left but the problem still exists with the cable box. I then turn around and called back Comcast. I am then connected to yet another representative by the name of Tom. He at first is apologetic and seems to work with me but then he asks for my best contact number which has already been documented way more than needed in a day. This is when I just ask him as politely as possible if this best contact number is already listed. I gave him the area code and prefix for him to find it because I knew it was listed already after speaking with the first three reps. I am now overtly aggravated because this is now the fourth time I have called Comcast and this representative is now arguing with me and talking over me instead of resolving this whole matter. All the while, I am at work! I even asked nicely to speak with his supervisor, whom I found out way later is in a meeting. He acts as if he is transferring me and then returns back on the line to not tell me that he or she is in a meeting, but that it's taking a while for them to pick up the line. He never told me a time for the technician's return to my home, nor did he confirm the rescheduled appointment. I therefore had to call again and spoke to a much nicer rep who confirmed the time for the technician's return and deeply apologized for all the trouble I had to endure throughout the day.Overall, I am so not satisfied with Amy's or Tom's performance. I recommend that they are retrained, disciplined for their actions or just seek a much different route of profession. I would like to commend the outstanding customer service to Allen, Marquessa (not sure if I spelled her name right) and Lee (female). They went out of their way to make sure that I received 100% customer satisfaction and I appreciate that wholeheartedly. Thank you!"
"Tanisha of Richmond, VA",4/4/2012,,"Customer Service, Canceled Account and Billing : I selected Comcast to handle my landline and my internet service. An appointment was selected and they came out during the appointment on March 8, 2012 and everything was fine. Until I woke up the next morning (March 9, 2012) to discover I did not have a landline dial tone, but I also did not have internet service. I contacted Comcast to find out what the problem was but found that they were unable to locate my account in the system. After approximately 15 minutes of searching, they located my account and determined the individual who installed my service did not ""push"" the order through and they would need to correct this matter. Within 90 minutes the internet was back up but the landline was not. I was told I would receive a phone call to confirm the landline was taken care of but that call never came. Just 45 minutes after the internet was restored, it went down again. I again contacted Comcast and the matter was ""fixed,"" but they still could not locate the phone number and that matter would be looked into and I would receive a phone call. That phone call also never came. I decided to do business with another company and have the phone number ported over. After four days of the new company being unable to port the number over, I contacted Comcast and was transferred to four different individuals before I decided to cancel the entire thing and get a new phone number. I was told I would not receive a bill because I cancelled in less than 30 days. I was never instructed where or when the equipment needed to be returned, so I took it upon myself to do this. I received a bill reflecting a balance and when I called to inquire about the charges, I was told the bill was incorrect and that I in fact did not have a balance and a new bill would be sent out. On 3/24/12, I returned the modem and router to the Comcast store in Richmond, VA. On 4/3/12, I received a bill reflecting a credit but not for the entire amount. On 4/4/12, I began the tedious task of contacting Comcast to get the matter resolved. Beginning at 17:37 hours on 4/4/12, I was transferred to collections because Adrianna could not assist me. At 17:42 hours, I spoke with John who could not assist me but stated he would transfer me. I told John I did not want to be transferred again but wanted to speak with a supervisor. At 17:50 hours, I spoke with Matt who advised he could not help me. I disconnected the call and called back. I called back, held for 12 minutes waiting and was disconnected before I could even speak with a representative. I called back, held for 10 minutes 20 seconds and spoke with Sheila who advised me she could not assist me but would get me right over to someone. At 18:25 hours, I spoke with Larry who attempted to assist me but the call was disconnected. I called back and held for 25 minutes and 20 seconds and spoke with Jeremy at 19:02 hours who advised me that he could not help me and that I would need to physically go into a location with the receipt showing it has been returned and the account will be zeroed out. Jeremy advised Larry was mistaken when he said he could assist me over the phone and because they could not verify with their own eyes that the equipment had been returned they would not believe that it had been. When I pressed Jeremy for another solution, he advised it could be faxed but that it would take two or more days to get to him for it to be processed. I am left with no other choice but to go into the Comcast store to resolve this matter because I have a Jewish Holiday coming up and surgery and cannot wait the time period for the matter to be resolved before my account is submitted to collections and negatively impact my credit score. I am beyond upset with how disrespectful of my time Comcast has been. Customer service has not been helpful and only wants to transfer the call to someone else or advise previous information is incorrect. I do not believe what Comcast representatives advise and do not trust that this matter will actually be resolved."
"Scott of Middletown, CT",4/4/2012,,"I don't understand how the Comcast pricing methodology is not illegal! I am currently paying $230 a month for phone, cable and internet. In an attempt to reduce my monthly bills in these tough economic times, I reached out to Comcast and asked them how I could reduce my bill. They started out by offering to remove the package that included all of the movie channels (which I never watch) and save me almost $60 a month. Perfect! Sounds great, right? Not so fast.They soon told me that I would lose the $30 a month package discount that I was receiving, that I would have to start paying for the DVR ($17 a month!) that was included in my current package, and that I would lose the NFL RedZone channel (literally the only channel that I actually watch) and it would cost me $6 a month to add it back. At the end of all the scams that they slapped on and called fees, the package was back to the same price! They literally could not reduce my package to a place where I would actually see a decrease in my monthly bill. In response to my displeasure, the customer service rep suggested that I change my phone to local calling only if I wanted to save money. I think that this is an outrage and feel completely taken advantage of. There are no other options in my area as AT&T is not currently offering Uverse to my neighborhood. If I could, I would drop Comcast tomorrow and never look back."
"Casey of Kennett Square, PA",4/4/2012,,"How can a company with such horrible service still be in business let alone charge what they do? I'm outraged with the service and plan to switch ASAP. Anyone in the market for a cable service should avoid Comcast at all costs! The internet works when it wants. It makes watching YouTube videos a nightmare. I mean it makes no sense that I can't get though something like a 4 minute music video. I don't use the house phone much so I can't say anything about that. The cable is another matter entirely. Every single morning without exception, the cable goes out at least once. Sometimes it come back on quickly and other times it flickers on and off for hours. I don't get to watch much TV. With the amount I pay for services, I expect quality when I have the time to relax and watch a show. Comcast, I will never do any type of business with you again."
"Marcos of Hialeah, FL",4/5/2012,,"I originally cancelled my Comcast service about 1.5 years ago. I cancelled due to their anti competitive practice of allowing 250 gigs of traffic, which is mainly meant to slow down Netflix adoption; so at that point, I decided to vote with my money. I moved to Uverse whom soon after activated the same limits as Comcast. After having billing issues with AT&T, I moved in with my grandfather and I decided to give Comcast another try. On Monday 04-02-11, I called to add internet to my grandfather's account. I confirmed details such as the name on the account, account number and address. The service was added without a problem and I was told to call back in one hour to activate the service. I called back on Tuesday 4-3-12 to add the MAC address and activate the service. I spoke to the tech department and provided the MAC address to the rep (the modem started to work immediately). The rep then requested the social security number of the account holder. I explained that the service had been added on Monday and that this information was not requested at that time. I voiced my opinion and stated that whatever information was needed to add a service should have been asked for at the time that the service was added. I informed him that the account holder was unavailable at the time due to the fact that he was sleeping at this time (9:30 pm). The rep insisted on the information. I decided to go speak to my grandfather and provided the last four numbers requested. The rep then requested to speak to my grandfather. I explained to the rep that my grandfather is not a native English speaker. I also explained to the rep that if he wanted to speak to the account holder, he should have said so from the beginning. I asked him to not give me the runaround. I mentioned that it is bad service to the customer to not process things in a clear order. He should have clearly mentioned that he needed to speak to my grandfather from the beginning if that's what he needed. I mentioned again that my grandfather did not speak English. The rep said that there was a Spanish line and that I would need to call there. He did not offer to give me the number or transfer me. He then mentioned that as long as he can hear my grandfather giving me the information in the background that it would be fine. By this time, I had mentioned various times that the modem was actually working and that if they were so concerned with security that they should turn the service off. I spoke to the supervisor of the associate that was helping me. I restated everything that had happened but she was equally unhelpful. I also mentioned to her that the service was actually working and that I just wanted the billing issue resolved. I asked if I could give the correct social security number and she said that I'd have to go into a Comcast office. I insisted that the issue be resolved immediately. I asked to speak to somebody who could do something and she mentioned that she was the only one on the floor. I asked to be transferred somewhere where I could be helped and the supervisor said okay. I asked for clarification as to where she would transfer me and she said that she did not have any control where I would end up. She stated that she would just transfer me to another call center and that she did not know who I would speak to or if they would be able to help me. I gave up on the situation for that night.On Wednesday morning, I woke up and found that the service was working. During my lunch break at work, I called corporate and informed them of everything that had happened. I did not give the social at that point (my failure), but they mentioned that we would need to go in person to a Comcast payment center to correct the problem. They also mentioned that they would address the training issue so that their representative request the information they need in an order that makes sense. They also confirmed that I would need to go to a Comcast payment center to correct this. On Wednesday afternoon, I spoke to my grandfather who informed me that he spoke to the Comcast Spanish line and they had mentioned that all was in order. They mentioned that the social security was correct and they even committed the sports package that I had added on Monday for him. I feel that we have been racially profiled our native language. I also feel that having my grandfather speaking in the background to someone who admitted to not understanding Spanish may have been ill motivated. I come to this conclusion due to the experience in the Spanish call center where the issue was addressed (temporarily). On Thursday morning, I woke up to no internet connection."
"Katherine of Irvington, nj",4/6/2012,,"When I requested services in my address for the fist time, they asked me for a deposit due to a credit matter; however, I agreed with that. They offered me the triple play for $99 plus tax. My bill came up to $143 because they were charging me home visit. Hello. What is going on? They asked for a deposit of $105 and they're still charging me for the visit. That really sucks. "
"Barbara of Crofton, MD",4/6/2012,,"My new neighbor subscribed to Comcast and we live in condos. The Comcast service person hooked me up to Comcast and after hers did not work he found the proper connections on the other side of her unit to do. However, he never came back to fix mine back to Verizon. My internet did not work, my TV had no channels that I previously had and my phone did not work. I called Verizon to look at the problem and they fixed the wiring and the box. All I am asking is for the 2 weeks that I was out of service to be paid to me and Comcast is asking for all kinds of past paperwork that I no longer have. It took them 2 months and me calling at least 10 times to even contact me. If you want good service with qualified people, call Verizon and subscribe to them and get out of Comcast! "
"Celia of Oregon city, OR",4/6/2012,,"After not having cable, phone or internet services for over a month, a Comcast representative came to my door with a check for $300 something. Two weeks later, I still don't have any services so I called Comcast and asked what the problem is. The billing department was so inflexible and said it wasn't their fault, the payment had not been received so I was told that I had to make another payment, that they will add a note stating that if the check was ever deposited, I will be refunded. This is where the lies all happened. After about 1 week, the check mysteriously appeared. This was 3 weeks later. Now, Comcast has taken over $750.00. After many calls with several different supervisors, I was told that nowhere in their system is such note about me getting my money back existed. Incredible. ""The calls are recorded for quality"", what ** quality? I was not able to pay all my rent. The representatives and supervisors were nothing but disrespectful, condescending and to this day, almost a month later, I still have not received my money. Bunch of thieves. It was all your company's fault. The only reason I still have your ** product is because there are no other options. I can for sure tell you that you are nothing but thieves and as soon as my ""credit"" that you say I have runs out, you will never ever be part of my family. You good for nothing liars.Upper management should have taken the time to read the supposed notes or at least listen to the multiple calls both my husband and I made as well as all the promises your reps made to us. Once more, thank you for nothing rats."
"Warren of Pompano Beach, FL",4/6/2012,,"Terrible installation practices: On April 5, 2012, Comcast was scheduled to install service at one of my rental properties. I had just recently renovated a duplex building and removed several hundred feet of cabling and fasteners from the side of the structure. Holes were patched and prepped for painting. Out of concern that Comcast would do their normal terrible get in, get out install job, I had my assistant call to inquire about installation at another property we owned. The sales person assured us that they install the cabling as instructed and would even fish the wire inside the walls if necessary. On the day of the installation, my assistant as well as the tenant were at the house to instruct the installer to run the cabling through the attic and down the walls. His response was, ""I am too big to crawl through the attic."" He was once again instructed to run the cable through the attic. He shook his head and proceeded to drill holes in my walls and ran the cabling along the outside of my building. Furthermore, he ran a cable from the outside around an entire room and then through another wall to get the cable into the living room. The installer left the premises without leaving a card or paperwork. I think he knew we weren't happy.My assistant then proceeded to call customer service where he was cut off, put on hold and given every reason why he could not speak to a supervisor. In total, he was on the phone 2 hours before he actually was allowed to speak with a supervisor. Then they offered to do nothing to address the problem. This is not my first poor experience with Comcast, but it will be the last. Comcast is now banned from all of my rental properties. Period."
"E of Hayward, CA",4/9/2012,,"I had an appointment with Comcast to have our internet switched to their service last Wednesday. That appointment was changed to today, 4/9, as they had the home number listed incorrectly. Instead, they had my cell number as the number to which the internet was to be connected to. We called Comcast and got the correct phone number to them and we were rescheduled to have the internet connected between 7:30 and 8:30 this morning. Today, I sat and waited from 6:30AM to 8:30AM with no call from Comcast. When I called to ask what happened, they claim they were locked out of the gated community and they called my phone and no one answered.This is a gated community, but my front door is directly on a street. There is no need to go into a gate to get to my apartment. You just need to go to the front door and knock. How hard is that? Also, they never called my cell phone as the tech claims and after reading all the comments of people who had bad experiences with Comcast, I read over and over where the techs called the home phone instead of the cell number that was left as a contact number. I have a home phone line, but not a home phone. We do not use our home phone line at all and that was explained to Comcast. After two bad experiences trying to get Comcast internet set up, I do believe this is a wake up call to not get Comcast internet! Comcast mixed up our phone numbers, our information, twice. I will not give them a third chance. If there is this much trouble trying to get their internet service, then I will take it as a sign not to go any further with this mess. Comcast seems to be too big for its britches. The commercials that Comcast has on TV about their excellent customer experience are just empty words."
"samuel of Fallston, MD",4/10/2012,,"Comcast, without direction, turned on my DVR and then sent me a notice stating that they would not charge me for their error in activating a service I did not request. From this point on, I would be charged an additional $16.95 a month. Now, I am forced to call their customer service to disconnect a service which they turned on in what I believe was a dishonest attempt to increase my cost. These are the types of business practices that which cable companies will always be untrusted for. No wonder you are always being investigated for overcharging and illegal cost increases. They have succeeded in adding one more customer to the long list of dissatisfied people who await the day that their monopoly is ended in providing phone, TV and internet services."
"Emilee of Villa Park, IL",4/10/2012,,"Failure to disconnect when requested now being harrassed: On December 17, 2011, I called Comcast and cancelled my service. I found a different company which was much more affordable. I have been using a different company for cable and internet. On April 7, 2012, I got 3 voice messages from Bob, and he called another four times without leaving messages. Then he called and left me a message on Easter Sunday and called three more times. Apparently, Comcast never disconnected my service, stopped sending me bills, and have been billing me the last 5 months that I haven't used their service. I requested that the service be disconnected. I called Comcast and was given multiple phone numbers to call. This Bob was calling my cell phone and leaving notes on my door. I can't get this man to leave me alone. No one at Comcast would even help me. All I got was ""I am sorry, but you need to call a different number."" I am thinking I need an attorney. I have filed a complaint with the BBB and FTC. I hope this helps. I will never ever do business with Comcast."
"Christy of Wartburg, TN",4/11/2012,,"I called to set up new service to the above address. We are moving in from out of state. I give the lady I talked to all the info she needed. She runs my credit check and tells me I have a $50 deposit. After I pay it, she takes the $50 out of my account. She says, â€œOh, we don't offer service at that address.â€ They did not give me a refund and told me to call my bank and dispute the charge. This is not right, they stole my money."
"Margarita of Miami, FL",4/12/2012,,"I called Comcast last week. I spoke to a rep named Patricia. She pretended to be very nice. I paid a past due bill and ordered new Comcast cable TV. She told me I was going to pay $69.95 for cable and internet service. Well, she lied. I called her back and told her I couldnâ€™t pay that amount and I needed a lower package. Well, she told me I could get the $49.95 with 100 channels also and itâ€™s the same as with the $69.95 plan she told me before. When I called Comcast back, I was told that she had given me only basic cable, so I cancelled the order. Oh, and she asked me to pay another $55.00 which I did. Well, she lied to me. So I just cancelled the order, but they did not refund me the $55.00. Then I called again yesterday and spoke to Gerard **. He told me that a tech was going to come today within 9 am and 9 pm today, 4/12/12, and I was lied to again. I called them back and they told me someone was out here yesterday at 4:30 pm and they didnâ€™t have access to the meter room.So, I asked to speak to the supervisor Gerard ** at ext. number **. Well, he told me that someone would be coming on Monday, which is five days from now. They already charged me and I still donâ€™t have a cable connection. He bounced me around like a ball and they donâ€™t resolve my issue. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on here, but I do know that I have seen Comcast guys having conversation with tenants and they give them service, too. I just want my service put in so I could watch TV, but they are up to a lot of tricks and lies which are hurting a few customers while others get more channels without paying for it. I just want my service put in ASAP and not be lied to every time I call."
"Jeana of Kingston, TN",4/13/2012,,"First time, they were hours late, then no call, no show by Comcast twice. On 4/6, I had an appointment for installation of new internet/cable service between 3 and 5pm. I waited until 6:15. They called and said they would be late obviously. They showed up around 7 and don't have the capability to hook up all TVs, so they run a cable on top of our driveway to our main TV and left. Today is 4/13. I haven't seen them since. They have stood us up twice this week, once on 4/11. We waited four hours for them. I called Comcast and a man told me he would call me within 15 minutes with an explanation. No one ever called. Then the next day, I called back and they informed me I had another appointment on this day, 4/12, between 3 and 5pm. Guess what? No show again! No call! Nothing. I have never been treated this disrespectfully! I have missed work waiting on this company. If I get a bill for this crappy cable that only works on one TV half the time, I will be even more upset! Do not use Comcast!"
"Toni of Houston, TX",4/13/2012,,"Well, I would like to know what I can do or where I should complain about the fact that they are putting on Nascar racing on instead of Friday Night Fights (boxing). My dad is old (92), and his lone pleasure is boxing, and that's one of the few things he has to look forward to. I don't know if it's ESPN or the local affiliate's programming that is the cause of this. As long as I'm here complaining, I would like to say that the box that Comcast forced us to buy (we didn't need it before) is emitting a high-pitched squeal that is very irritating and it won't go away."
"Hussain of Willow Grove, PA",4/13/2012,,I pay for Comcast on-demand services. Why do I have to watch commercial ads on the part of the Comcast service that I pay for? This is annoying.
"M of Apt 545, va",4/15/2012,,"I needed to scale down for budgetary purposes and decided I wanted to get rid of my cable service altogether, but keep my high speed Internet, which I use for work-at-home purposes. Comcast threatened that if we canceled our cable, they would raise the price of high speed Internet, so that it would cost more to do high speed Internet only than to do high speed Internet plus cable. These people are savages. This is supposed to be America. We are supposed to be concerned with monopolies and trusts - with collusion and price-fixing and absence of competition - with the bullying of the American consumer. Shame on Comcast and on the American politicians."
"Kowhe of Chicago, IL",4/16/2012,,"I have been using Comcast high speed internet for a long time. It works fine until recently, I got no signal with my Comcast internet connection. So I called Comcast tech support, and they tried helping me on their end, but still could not figure it out, so they told me they will send a service people out to my residence. Two days later, the Comcast service tech called me and asked me if the problem still exists, and I tried again and it looked OK, so I told the service guy need not to come to do the checking since it works again. But the Comcast guy insisted to come.After he took a look of my cable modem/router, he said everything looked fine now -  the cause may be due to the Chicago water facility works surrounding my neighborhood, and he left. Three weeks later, I received my monthly statement from Comcast which included a $30 charge for the service I just mentioned. I called Comcast customer service, and discussed with a service rep my case. She then discussed with her supervisor and called me back and said, â€œI am sorry, but this is a legal charge. We can not return your money back to you.â€ Above is my true experience with Comcast recently. I just like to warn others who are currently using Comcast service, be aware of the unreasonable, unfair charge you may get, even if the problem is not in the customer's end."
"cheryl of Fresno, CA",4/16/2012,,"My father died. I cancelled his Comcast account and returned his equipment. I was told he was due a refund and the check would be mailed in my name so that I could cash it. Well, it came in his name, a deceased man's. I called them and told them I cannot cash it. They assured me they would reissue it in my name. Well, this time it was written to his estate. I again called them and even though I told them that there is no probate or estate and that I am the executor of his will, they still refused to issue it in my name. So now, I have a good for nothing check. So, I wonder just how many people they do this to and just how much money they never really return that does not belong to them. I will never have Comcast and I will tell everyone just what kind of company they are."
"Beatriz  of Hollywood, FL",4/16/2012,,They cannot cancel my account because they cannot find it. I have been on hold with one department or another for over an hour with their music.
"don of Jacksonville, FL",4/17/2012,,I have signed up for auto-pay but they are not billing my payment method. I have attempted to use my credit card to submit payment online but it fails every time. This is not a problem with my credit card. I've checked with the credit card company. This problem has persisted for over 6 months. No one can accept payment over the phone. I cannot submit payment online. Comcast has a serious problem. I've submitted multiple online emails for resolution. I lodged complaints on the phone..so far no resolution.
"Lawrence of Charottesville, VA",4/17/2012,,"Gary **, a Comcast technician did repair a computer connection that provided me with good service. However, without telling me, he did disconnect a wireless modem leaving me with no service in another area. After two conversations with a Comcast operator by phone, I got no satisfaction. I was told to contact Netflix to make repairs, which I did. The initial inspection cost me $150 and he had to purchase and install a more advanced modem, adding another $250 to the bill. Thus, the total situation cost me $400. Since your technician created the problem, and did not tell me about it, I think a billing adjustment by Comcast is appropriate. "
"Janet of Oakland, CA",4/17/2012,,"Unauthorized credit check - All I did was go to Comcast's website to check out prices for their internet service. They required my address so I entered that information. Today (04/16/2012), I received a letter from Comcast informing me they had made a credit inquiry on me. I know that numerous inquiries can hurt your credit and I never authorized or requested this. I am outraged that Comcast would do something so sensitive without permission. I now know that I will never trust this company and will never use them. How can I undo this credit check? I feel so violated and helpless."
"russ of Peru, IL",4/17/2012,,We closed our hotdog stand and it has been since 3-29-12 trying to get the service restored. Today is 4-18-12 and still no service. My wife has called and talked to no less than 15 different people for the date to have them come out and nothing.
"Allison of Knoxville, TN",4/18/2012,,"My phone service has been out since April 13 and my wireless is not working. I called on the evening of April 16 and the rep tried to send signals and it didn't work so he said we needed a service call and asked if Tuesday would work - I said no. He said, â€œHow about Wednesday?â€ I said yes, and he said â€œBetween 8-10am?â€ I said, â€œPerfect. I take my child to school and will be home by 8:15.â€ He never gave me a date so of course I thought it's today - but no, it's next Wednesday, the 25th.I would have never agreed to wait a week and a day for the service call. So I have stayed home waiting for 2 hours this morning for nothing! Do the reps need to make sure and triple check with the customers on the date and time? Now I'm on a waitlist. I have to wait and hope a technician either gets a cancellation or gets some extra time, and will call me to see if it's a good time to come by. If not, I have to wait a week. I am not happy about this situation at all!"
"Elario of Bacliff, TX",4/18/2012,,"I am a new customer and I only ordered internet Xfinity. I was told of all the charges and then today, I get my first bill and they have added a reconnect fee, which I was never told about. I was told there was no installation fee because I was a new customer. I called and, of course, they dance around what I was told and tell me I have to pay the installation fee. This is so unfair and sad that a company as large as Comcast would play these games to get a customer to sign up and then they screw you over with added fees. What happened to honesty and giving a customer what you promised? The guy that came to install the internet couldn't even help me setup my computer because he does not know the Apple computer. I had to pay someone else to come setup my computer. The installer didn't give me a so called welcome package and didn't do anything but connect from the outside. Now, letâ€™s be fair. Should I have to pay for services that the installer had no knowledge of setting up my Apple laptop? Until today, 2 weeks later, I still don't have a Comcast email address."
"Jill of San Francisco, CA",4/19/2012,,"Comcast's unwanted malware alert is the only malware on my computer. I've called (a 3-hour ordeal) and was met with pompous arrogance by a guy that claimed no supervisor was available and if there was, he'd tell me the same thing. I followed the instructions for removal to no avail and let him know this. Finally, he said he would remove this obstruction. Two days later, it's back. "
"Axel of San Jose, CA",4/19/2012,,"My Comcast internet service is constantly cut or so slow it is impossible for me to load web pages. This does not allow me to accomplish any work that needs to be done at home, do any online gaming and forces me to work late nights at the office. Sometimes the service is as bad as not getting a signal at all. Whenever I call to ask about what could be wrong, they constantly try to blame the problem on my router or modem, both of which I replaced already the first time they told me to, or put me on hold for an unreasonably long amount of time. Then, when I called a technician to come over, he claims there is no problem and promptly goes to charge me $40 for coming over. Then when he leaves, I try to resume work and the internet connection gets cut again."
"Jerry of Washougal, WA",4/19/2012,,"A year ago, I was advised by Comcast phone rep that bundled service (internet, phone and CATV) would not change from $119.99 for two years provided I agreed to have automatic payment from credit card for such term. I just received bill raising rate to $134.99. Phone contact today said contract was only for a year at which time it would increase and that there is a $90 charge to break such contract. I was not told any of this last year."
"Sue  of Salem, or",4/19/2012,,"You took off the SOAPnet channel without even telling us. And when we called to complain, you put on a recording because you can't be bothered with us. At least take the calls instead of ignoring us. We pay enough for the service and I know you have had a lot of unhappy customers about this. It would be nice if for once a company would make their customers happy. But most companies don't care. I guess we will see if you do."
"Linda of Jackson, MS",4/20/2012,,"I put in a service call on April 17. Today is April 20 and I have not had any service for phone, cable and internet. I have called and I got different answers of why I have no service as of today. I know that I am just one customer and I will no longer be a customer. Thank you for the worst service award."
"Lisa of Springfield , MA",4/20/2012,,I discovered that SoapNet is out of line up. I want it back!
"Etta  of Amherst, MA",4/22/2012,,"On April 21 and April 22, 2012, I attempted to pay an outstanding balance with Comcast online. I am a paperless customer. I completed the procedure twice and got a ""try again later"" message both times. On April 22, I tried to contact Comcast, but their online ""help"" is useless and I couldn't find a telephone number on the webpage where I could call. So I sent an email outlining my problem - difficulty paying online, paperless-billing customer, would my account be double-debited for the $425.57 payment, would my service be disconnected? A return email directed me to a Comcast online ""analyst"" who said I couldn't be helped because I didn't have my Comcast billing number (remember, I'm paperless) and I wouldn't give the last four digits of my SSN number. Both my husband and I have been victims of identify theft. I don't give out my SSN to anyone, but my physician and my bank. So I'm stuck. Either I've paid my bill or it haven't. Either my account will be double-debited for the same amount or it won't. This is not customer service. This is customer abuse. It is very difficult to get a problem addressed by Comcast. If I had an alternative, like switching to another cable provider, I'd do it in a heartbeat. But I'm self-employed and need the internet to work, as does my husband. Hope you can help by collecting dissatisfied customer data."
"Martha of Harwich, MA",4/23/2012,,"I'm outraged at the cost of basic cable (10 channels) and internet - $60/month. I purchased a bundled service with Comcast last year. I was told I didn't have a contract, yet this year the fees increased by 33%, and they can't even tell me how long this next step in the pricing is good for. When I asked what options I have, the answer is, you can pay more and get less service (i.e significantly slower internet). Obviously, I'm only a basic user and there are no competitors in my area. I'm stuck.I want a business model where I have a monopoly and can raise prices 33% per year and call what I deliver a promotion. Do they really think they are giving us a deal? Does it really cost $60 per month for internet service and 10 (what should be ""free"") channels? Someone needs to oversee these people and force them to provide their service at a reasonable price, especially if there are no competitors. Ridiculous!"
"David of Memphis, TN",4/24/2012,,"Last March I opened a business internet account with a static IP with Comcast. The only reason that I needed a business account/static IP was that my wife needed it per her employer at the time. The situation was that I took a new job in Memphis and my wife moved with me from California. At the time, she was allowed by her California employer to work remotely but was told she would need a static IP in order to connect with the company network. The only way that Comcast will provide a static IP address is with a business account.A few months after moving here, my wife's employer decided that the long distance thing was not working out and my wife had to look for a new job. When this first happened, I contacted Comcast to see what my options were in regards to dropping the static IP and the commercial account, and switching over to a residential account for personal use only. I was told that they could drop the static IP without penalty but that I would be responsible for the full term of the business contract which was 36 months. When I first talked to Comcast in regards to opening this account, I was under the impression that the term was for one year which is all I would ever agree to, under the circumstances. When I signed the service order, I did not notice that it was for 36 months. I just checked the agreement real quick to ensure that the monthly charges were as agreed to and signed it. That was my mistake but at the time I was scrambling to get moved that I got a little careless. So, we did drop the static IP and I decided that I would just live with the higher commercial rate for my personal internet access. Now, we are moving from the apartment we live in to a duplex in another part of town where the landlord pays for internet access, so I need to cancel the service in its entirety. However, I am running into a brick wall. The customer service reps tell me that I will have to pay a penalty which amounts to $1318 which I cannot afford. I also do not believe that I am responsible for this either.I have read the Terms and Conditions which state that this penalty will be charged if the customer terminates service without cause. In the section regarding termination for cause, it lists termination of business as cause which I am positive my wife's situation qualifies for. So, I should be able to cancel without penalty. So it comes down to this. The original business needed for a static IP and thus a business account no longer exists. The need for any internet service is not required as I am moving and internet is provided at the new location. Based upon this, I believe that I should be able to disconnect without penalty."
"Kelli of Cordova, TN",4/24/2012,,"I have about had it. We scheduled the install in October 2011. Due to problems beyond our control it was not installed, was rescheduled multiple time by Comcast and eventually was installed on December 19th (2 months later). At that time, we were promised a $250 gift card (that has never arrived, big surprise). When I went to the service center the next day, it was already not working correctly. My husband called in January and February to tell them all of our channels were not coming in, to which they did nothing! When they finally sent someone out at the end of March after a 3-hour phone call from my husband where they promised a $100 credit for the problem with our HD, they proceeded to charge us $50. And when that tech couldn't get it right, we were charged another $50 when the next tech came out for the problems we had been complaining about since January. After a lengthy phone call, they promised a $50 credit for one of the tech visits. To date Comcast owes me the following amounts: $250 gift card, $100 HD credit and a $50 service person overbill credit. Have I seen a dime of it? Of course not! I really hope they burn!"
"Nandasiri of Catonsville , MD",4/25/2012,,"On Sunday, January 8, 2012, I spent about 3 hours on the phone trying to resolve a problem regarding our email - i.e. emails sent by one individual are sent back with an error message. Each time I called, the call would go to an outsourced country (Philippines, I believe) and three times I was given the runaround. On the fourth call, I was told by an individual that the call had come to a ""fee-based area"" of Comcast and that I had to pay upfront $49.00! I was shocked by this method of Comcast to collect money for a problem that has originated from Comcast. I vehemently declined to pay a cent. I tried another call, this time asked for the supervisor and the rep said the ""manager has gone home"". I told him call centers don't run without a supervisor. Well, I tried again (6th call) and this time, I asked again for a manager. I was told that the supervisor was on the phone, but he said the supervisor would call me back and asked for my USA number. From past experience, I told him that people in the foreign-located offices never call USA customers to settle a problem. He lied as I have so far not received a call. I am sure if I had spoken to a rep in the USA, this problem would have been resolved. I am frustrated and fed up with Comcast customer service. Who should I contact now?"
"Hoon of Beaverton, OR",4/26/2012,,"On 10/27/2011, I called a number on the advertisement flyer which shows 3 Mbps service for $14.99 for first 6 months, then $24.99 for the next 6 months. I confirmed twice with the Comcast operator that it is indeed the correct speed and the price is correct. I signed up for the service. On 11/5/2011, when my service was installed, I noticed the speed is 1.5 Mbps, and not 3 Mbps. I called Comcast and spoke with operator ID **. I was told that there must have been an error, and they don't offer 3 Mbps for that price. So, I upgraded to a 3 Mbps service and was told the price is $19.99 for the first 6 months, then $29.99 for the next 6 months. I said fine.On 4/26/2012, it was time to pay the bill for the 7th month. I saw my bill and it was showing $62.95. I called Comcast and spoke with operator ID **. She said from the note, from 11/5/2011, I was offered a 12 Mbps service (not 3 Mbps) for $19.99 for only the first 6 months, with no mentioning about the next 6 months. I spoke with the supervisor, but he didn't help at all telling me that's what's on their conversation history note.They lied to me twice; once when I signed up, and the second time on the first date of service, when I called to complain about the speed and bumped up my plan. I have to pay $39.95 for the 3 Mbps if I want to continue using their service now."
"Jim of Cartersville, GA",4/28/2012,,"I contacted Comcast by phone in mid-February to request that the overpayment be immediately deposited back to my bank account. The agent said that she would ensure that the request is logged in the system and forwarded to the right department to process, but it may take 6 weeks. I have called several times asking for the status. They have notes in the system reflecting the request, but can not give me a reason for the delay or better timing. I called last week (9+ weeks) and was told by the agent that she would escalate the request and someone would call me within 72 hours to help. Today, I went to the local Comcast office to cancel service and asked for my refund. The customer service agent said that she would email the refund department in Atlanta. I told her that I appreciated that, but considering the delay to this point, I would prefer that she calls. She told me that she did not have their number and has done all that she can do. I requested to speak with a supervisor, but was told that she is in Tennessee. I asked if we could call, but was told that she is on vacation. I asked how can we escalate this since I have made several attempts and have not received any follow through."
"Minerva of Portage, IN",4/30/2012,,"The price of Comcastâ€™s triple play is so high that I really cannot afford it. When the bill for TV, internet and phone for a year is higher than my NIPSCO statement, then itâ€™s horrible. And no one else can give you all three in our area. My bill will now exceed over $2,000 a year."
"Michael of Los Gatos, CA",4/30/2012,,I ordered a very simple internet cable service. What I got billed for was a bundle costing twice as much and a service that didn't work. I called to cancel and was finally able to get it done after telling the clown on the phone to stop trying to resell me the service. I will never do business with Comcast again. Slipshod organization in my opinion.
"Tewania of Wheaton, IL",5/1/2012,,"I've been a customer of Comcast since 2001. I've always paid my bills, so in 2010, I moved to my current address. I've paid on my bill, we started having problems in Nov 2011. I've paid Comcast $150.00 on my bill. Then in Dec 2011, I paid them $170.00 + $80.00 + $25.00. After they've received my money, they cut me off so I got my money back from my bank. I was to pay the full balance of $301.00 before my service is restored. I've walked in their office and gave them $200.00 in January 25, 2012 plus I sent them $50.00 through Western Union on March 9, 2012 and they're still trying to make my bill be $391.00. My services is currently off. They've said once I pay the $301.00, they will credit my account.It's a payment I've paid to Comcast. I went to the bank asking them to pull up all payments made to Comcast. I then discovered a payment made for $110.00 in 2010, right before I moved. Comcast said that wasn't applied to my bill. Bank of America printed it out for me, it was paid with my debit card. They're claiming that they don't have the payment. I have my bank's printout. I faxed this information to them and they're still giving me problems. They have my money. When they apply this missing payment, it will bring my bill down. Please help me with this matter in retrieving my funds and apply it to my bill."
"Hugh of Milford, MI",5/1/2012,,"It is truly unbelievable that I paid them more than $2000 for this kind of treatment. My service with Comcast is totally unacceptable and they are the only cable/internet provider in my area. We have spent countless hours/day and missed work to deal with their complete ineptitude. They mis-installed the cable, services did not work, numerous service calls, failed equipment, numerous mis-billings, multitude of customer service calls with the most recent one now lingering for 6 weeks, 18 phone calls and still no resolution!Here are the issues: When the service was installed, the installer said he did not install cable receptacles and we needed to hire an electrician. The internet service did not work for one month after installation. My service was cut off because they were sending me the bill via the internet, which was not working, and despite, I had set up recurring payment on my AMEX. It took them 2 days to restore service. When I signed up for new service, I was to receive $200 rebate. But since my account went into arrears (see above), they would not grant it. Our cable TV service had a lot of static, we called for repair. Cable service came out and said we needed a booster and they would need to order. We called one month later, still no booster, they sent another cable repair man and he showed up and said we needed a booster and would need to order.We called again one month later, since no booster, I told them we need to have the booster installed but said they could not stick it on the truck and would have to send out a technician. We told them he would not be allowed in the house unless he had one. The TV service improved, upstairs performance still terrible. The digital converter box failed a few months into the service, were told we would be charged a service call to fix/drop off new. I was told to go to the nearest service center. That service center is 40 miles away and I stood in line for 1 hour. The new digital converter box failed shortly after, I must travel to service center and wait again. For TVs without the digital box, they send analog to digital converter. I was unable to make it work. I called service, they dropped my call 3 times and by the time it was resolved, I was on the phone for over two hours!I received numerous bills with errors including charging for equipment we didn't have, upping our rates even though we were locked in for 2 years, charging us for movies we did not rent. 5 weeks ago, I tried once again to sync Comcast calendars between my wife and myself. We both have Comcast and this is standard functionality. I tried by myself numerous times and finally called. On phone for an hour, it was supposedly resolved. I tried, it did not work. This time, I chatted online for over 1 hour and at the end, they told me the system went down and they couldn't help me anymore. It still does not work. I then submitted an online request to their email, left my cell phone number. It took them over a week to respond and still called my home phone which I rarely use. A supervisor called me. I called them back, no return call. I called them again and got it escalated. A day later, a second line support called. I granted access/passwords to both account and after an hour, he confirmed it does not work! Yes, I know that. He escalated it to national. I got a call two days later telling me it was fixed and left their number. I tested it, it does not work! I called back, bad number. I then called the supervisor back. He assigned me to someone else. I called them, but no response. I called back the supervisor and then the new supervisor called me. I asked for him to send me an email with his contact info, none was ever received. I called back to his number from my cell, it is a general number. I called the old supervisor back and got the new supervisor's direct number. The issue is still unresolved as of today. I do not know when it will be fixed.I made a service call last week to fix the still lingering bad signal upstairs, made an appointment but they never showed up. I called back, asked if we had a ticket number but none was ever given. My wife again took off work to wait for them, they did not show up. I wanted to transfer service in just my wife's name. They sent a letter telling us that we both had to sign and personally show up to a service center (which is 45 minutes away and the last time, I stood in line for 1 hour) in order to change it! Are you kidding me?"
"Arthur of Pacific Grove, CA",5/3/2012,,"Months ago, we called Comcast to reduce our bill. At that time, we had 2 cable boxes. Our boxes were so old that they could not reboot them online. A service man arrived, took the box and replaced our remaining one box. Our cable rate was higher with one box as a result of this visit, so my wife called and we were told we now had a high-def box at a $10 monthly charge which was higher than having 2 old boxes, which was an  $8/mo charge. We did not request high-def, nor were we told that he was leaving a high-def box , nor that there would be an increased charge. My wife was on the phone for 5 hours today attempting to solve the problem, but there was constant resistance from every agent. The supervisor asked my wife if she would take a survey to which she answered yes. There has been no return call, I wonder why? As a result of this service call and new box we have been overcharged monthly. There was even resistance to sending a service man to correct a service problem, offering to give us a new box if we went to the service center in Salinas, CA. We pay a monthly fee to have a man come to the house and my wife informed the agents of such. Please rectify this situation. "
"Denise of Wilmington, de",5/4/2012,,"Darren cut me from my services and set up a disconnection in May. I asked him to keep me on the same plan. He said no and gave me my disconnection notice over the phone and told me I would no longer receive cable after May 16, 2012. I felt sad. Here I am struggling to pay my bills and this company doesn't seem to care. Okay, disconnect my services. I pay my bills on time. If you don't want my money then fine. You're not the only cable internet company out there."
"Sally of Other, MI",5/5/2012,,"My 90+ in-laws have been without service for over a week. I don't know, but your service is a lifeline and they have nothing."
"Donna  of Elmwood, TN",5/6/2012,,"I ordered Comcast Cable from a very nice representative, who set me up with an appointment the next morning between 8am and 10am. I told him I had to work that day, but that my mother lives with me and would be there all day. He said that was fine. I received a courtesy call confirming the appointment and that someone over 18 had to be there.The next morning about 9am, my mother called and said that the man had come and said I had to be there or he wouldn't hook up the cable. She said he was grumbling about other jobs he had to do. I called Comcast about the trouble and what the man had said and done. All the representatives apologized, but they did nothing but either said that all the workers were busy taking care of other customers until Monday or that they would send somebody out. But nobody came. This went on from about 9am to well after 4 pm and at least 10 calls about our appointment. Customer service for your company is apparently a joke at this point. This was, without a doubt, the worst service I have ever received by any company of any kind; and if I were the executive in charge of customer service, I would not admit to it."
"Dan of Houston, TX",5/8/2012,,"I own a tattoo shop and recently bundled my internet with my phone service with Comcast. I run a credit card machine off our phone line. Since signing up with Comcast, our phone and internet have been down 4 times in as many weeks. We lose money each time by not having access to our credit card machine. I have spoken with Comcast on several occasions and have experienced the worst customer support ever. They seem totally incompetent. We have requested someone out to our site 3 times now and they send someone at 9 a.m. on Saturday each time although I have explained our hours over and over. This is the worst dealings I've ever had with a company."
"Teresa of Brighton, MA",5/9/2012,,"After seeing a promotion for $150 Visa Gift Card with bundled service, I decided to try Comcast. I was to have my service installed mid-October. The day before installation, I received a call from a rep telling me my installation needed to be rescheduled because there was no service contract on file. Without that, I could not receive my promotion. I was connected to a department where answers to their questions were recorded. It was a verbal agreement to a 2-year contract with them. I was told it would take 3 months to receive my gift card. When March arrived and I had not received my card, I called to inquire about it. I was told someone would get back to me. April came, and I called again. For the second time, I was told someone would get back to me. By the time May 2 came along, I was furious. I called and was told she personally would get back to me, which she did not. I called yet again on the 8th and the man gave me my word he would look further into this and he would personally call me before the day ended. Guess what? It never happened. This morning, I spoke to yet another rep. He put me on hold for a brief period of time and came back to tell me there was no contract on file. I insisted I did indeed have my conversation recorded for a verbal contract. Now he is looking into this, saying that without a contract, I could not qualify for the gift card. He gave me his number and extension and I am to call him in a week if no one gets back to me. I am beyond angry at this point. If they don't keep their word and send me my Visa card, they can take their service and shove it where the sun don't shine. I never had a problem with RCN. I should have stayed with them, but I will definitely be returning to them!"
"Jeannie of Lebanon, PA",5/10/2012,,"Roughly about a year ago, I wanted to try the 3G or 4G to go, so I signed a contract of a year with Comcast. I was very dissatisfied with the service. I mean, it was just terrible. I only attempted to use it about 6 to 7 times and every time I tried using it, it was very slow and it would freeze especially in the highway. So I went personally to the Comcast office around Christmas time to cancel the service, but I was told that if I canceled before the year of the contract that I agreed to, I would have to pay the full amount of whatever the device was worth. So I had no choice but to keep paying for the stupid service. So when the time was up, I went personally to the office to cancel the service for the 3G or 4G to go. Lo and behold, I was in for a surprise. The service that I was paying for was no longer available. The office worker had mentioned to me that it had been a while since Comcast had the service because of so many complaints. So I wanted to speak to a manager so that I could get a refund for paying for something that was no longer available through Comcast. I also learned that I had to return the device to Comcast even though I was faithfully paying for the service throughout the whole year. I will pursue further action if I don't get a response from Comcast or receive what is rightfully mine. I would like a manager to please call me asap. I'm not going to pay my bill until I get answers and the refund that I'm entitled to. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter."
"Judy of Stuarty, FL",5/10/2012,,"My 78-year old sister-in-law was told she needed to upgrade her cable box and they told her to go to a Comcast store to get the box, which she did. But she did not know how to hook up the box (silly, why wouldn't they send someone immediately to do it?). Anyway, we drove 60 miles to hook it up for her, and the box was bad. It didn't hold the signal. I called Comcast while I was there and asked to have a tech bring out a new box and install. This was Sunday. They said Wednesday was the earliest appointment they had but that they would escalate the call since she only has one box and one TV.Needless to say, we didn't hear anything about the escalation the rest of Sunday or Monday. The only thing we heard was that the tech would be out Wednesday between 9-11. So Wednesday morning came and went, and no tech person despite two confirmation calls. Finally late afternoon, we called and were told that the tech who was supposed to come in the morning didn't show for any of his appointments and they couldn't send anyone else until next Monday. What kind of service is this? More than a week to replace a bad box that they gave her to begin with? There is no customer service with Comcast."
"Ronnie of The Woodlands, TX",5/12/2012,,"Last year a Comcast tech came out and installed a splitter on my cable. They told me that I wasnâ€™t getting a strong enough signal. Then when my cable stopped working, another Comcast tech came out and said they should not have put a splitter on my cable. The next month, I received a bill for a service call that is over $60.00 now because they keep putting a ""surcharge"" on my bill. I called to clear my account and they sent me another bill with another ""surcharge"" tacked on. Why don't they take responsibility for their screw-ups? I do for mine. Screwed by big corp."
"Bhartrihari of Malvern, PA",5/15/2012,,"I tried to upgrade my service and I went to collect my digital box. The lady at the counter took 45 minutes to retrieve my account. She insisted that my account does not exist at all (crap I have been using this service for full 4 years). After a lot of inconvenience, I received my digital box and the lady did not give me any cable with it. No manual was provided as well. Next comes the painful process of activation. I called at their customer care number for activation and I was routed through 4 states (spanning 45 minutes). And ultimately, someone picked the call and she told that I have to go to Comcast office and pick the cable crap. The worst customer care I have seen for a crap expensive service."
"Matthew of Parker, CO",5/15/2012,,"Worst company ever. I have never been so dissatisfied with a company on an ongoing basis. Worst people to deal with on the planet. In fact, I prefer deciphering Hindu when I call my ** mortgage company to speaking with any Comcast representative."
"Barin of Miami, FL",5/15/2012,,"Last week, Friday, I set up services to have at my place residence. Just to make sure there is no deposit, I called and spoke with 3 different people and they seem to be not aware of the package deal that I have already set up and about to finalize it. Each person was incompetent of not locating the package and was unable to properly navigate the same website, to which I have navigated to get the package deal. Being frustrated by this, I just finalized the package deal and scheduled my appointment for May 16, 2012 between the hours of 11AM and 5PM. Today, I received a message on my phone stating that I must return some equipment and pay for a balance on some account. I called to find out about this and was told that this account belongs to my sister, which she has the same last name as mine. I have told them that this should have nothing to do with me and that is her account. I have been a customer in the past, in good standing and paid all my bills and returned any equipment. They told me that because I have cancelled my services and she started her service, that I have to still pay for her balance and be charged for the equipment if I don't return it. I feel like this is a bad relationship to start with a previous customer in good standing and that with the monopoly of the area, they are being very abusive making the consumers to pay for other accounts that don't belong to them. This is very bad business practice. Because of this type of practice and the monopoly over the area, it leaves me to not have any internet services at all."
"Raman of Missouri city, TX",5/16/2012,,"This is my third attempt to get my cable fixed. When I don't pick up their courtesy call, they cancel the service call, even if I call back to confirm during the appointment time."
"Jennifer of Loganville, GA",5/16/2012,,"Overcharged me and cut my service off - They cannot explain why they are charging me $256.00 and wants $170.00 before they will turn my cable back on. I have bank statements dated back November of 2011 showing all the payments that Iâ€™ve made and that I am paid up until May 22nd, 2012."
"Michael of Paducah, KY",5/17/2012,,"Incompetent service installation - Three months ago, I called to ask if I could split a cable to a second home on my property. I was told by Comcast that that would be considered theft because it was a separate address. Fair enough. An installer came to connect the other service, but used a two-way splitter at the pole dividing my signal with the other home. A line was laid on the ground across the driveway for a temporary connection. The new splitter was installed without the ground wire, leaving a lightning damage hazard. After several calls and missed appointments over several months, a service technician came to the property and disconnected my service, leaving the ungrounded temporary line still lying across the driveway. After 5 or 6 calls being promised a technician to come back out, and that a supervisor would be contacting me within 2 hours (promised 3 times, no call), I finally got to talk to a supervisor who scheduled a service call in two days, and a credit of $40.00 (slightly more than one week of service). Really! If I had connected a splitter, it would have been theft of service. When they did the same thing and billed both of us for full service, it was a minor inconvenience."
"Elliot of Wilmington, DE",5/17/2012,,"We pay a lot of money to see our favorite HBO shows. So what happened to Curb on Demand? I look forward to that show in particular, and if I can't get it on demand, I want to know why!"
"jonathan of Cape May Ch, NJ",5/18/2012,,"My monthly bill went from $114.95 to $191 and despite two calls to Comcast, I cannot get a straight answer other than ""We are sending a copy of the bill."" I was also hung up on after being on hold for 17 minutes. What is happening to this company? I have paid bills on time for years. I just got a Fios promo in the mail. I wonder if they are better than this kind of treatment."
"Steve of Santa Rosa, CA",5/18/2012,,"I am writing this letter, because I cannot believe that Comcast has been allowed to conduct business in an uncontestable and blatantly illegal manner. They have continuously offered services, knowing that their ultimate plan was to eventually and deceitfully increase their service rates (annually) and intentionally charge customers unjustified fees for service and equipment fees they do not even have (monthly). This practice is well-planned and intentional. By not informing their customers prior to signing up for service and charging for services and equipment that the customer never receives, they have constructed and executed an additional way to illegally and unethically acquire revenue. Additionally, having read a few of the thousands of typical and similar complaints via the internet, one can easily ascertain that rate increases, unwarranted fees, and overcharging for services and/or equipment seem to be Comcast's way of doing business. Comcast not only deceives their customers initially but throughout the interim. Unfortunately, when these issues are questioned or exposed, they will credit gladly, only after many frustrating hours of phone calls, credit those lucky few and informative customers; however, only partially instead of completely. For the record, I also see that Comcast is not regulated in the State of California. They do what they want.This first page has to do with my own personal issue with Comcast during the first year of service and the rate increase and overcharging I encountered after the first initial year. It seems to be a typical customer complaint. However, it is the next page or year 2-3 that has me most upset. This is not a typical complaint.In approximately January 2010, a Comcast sales manager knocked on my door, offering me a good deal on Comcast services. Instead of the typical advertisement strategies, Comcast had hired door-to-door salespeople to push their services and counter their competition, AT&T. The salesman, after giving me his sales pitch and considering my personal needs, stated that he could offer me a complete television, internet, and phone package for $89.99 per month. He added that an additional charge of approximately $11.99 would be added on top for an additional fax line I needed. With taxes etc., my monthly bill averaged approximately $126.00. I agreed, and when the service was installed, the installer forgot to bring a router. He said he would be back within the day with the router, but after many days of waiting, he never came back. So, I had to purchase my own. The installer also left behind a box that I was recently informed is a DVR player (2 years later). I also learned that I have been being charged an additional fee for this DVR for over (2) years. I was told by the installer that if I added an additional television, I could use it and it was part of the package for no additional fee. So, he hooked up HD service downstairs, a small white basic box to my 3D television in my bedroom, the internet for my computer, my phone line, and the fax. I agreed to this price, because it was lower than that of AT&T. I never signed any contract and was never told of any future increases, etc. It was a handshake deal. No plans, contracts, or rate increases were a part of this transaction period.In January 2011 or approximately one year later, I received my monthly Comcast bill and noticed my service fee rate had increased from the basic $89.99 charge to $109. 99. With the additional fax line and taxes, etc., my monthly bill went from about $126.00 to $166.00 per month, a jump of $40.00/month. I immediately called Comcast and complained. I told them that I had never agreed or was never notified verbally, in writing or in any way, that this plan would increase after a year. I asked the Comcast Customer Service woman if she could provide something, anything, in writing that showed that I was ever informed or agreed to a rate increase. She replied that she could not and explained that I had been originally signed up to a plan that was to increase to the normal amount after one year. She then stated that specific Comcast policy is to inform their customers of this rate increase by informing you via your (new) bill and that bill with the rate increase was my notice. I replied, ""You have got to be kidding!"" I said further that it didn't make any sense. So in short, the increased rate on the bill is your notification. She went on to say that I was on a plan that offered an initial service fee of $89.99/month. After one (1) year, it was to increase to the normal plan rate of $109.99. I again requested her to provide anything, ad or flyer, a signed contract, letter or email anything that could prove that I was knowingly entering into an agreement with the knowledge of or being informed that my rate would increase in a year. Again, she could not, and again, she repeated the Comcast policy that ""Your new bill with the rate increases is your notice."" Well, after a few more calls totaling several hours on the phone, frustrated and exhausted, I gave up and thought, ""Oh well, what can I do? I felt I was just ripped off and there's nothing I could do about it, except to go back to AT&T. At least I knew what I'd be paying from now on.""Fast forward twelve (12) months, and deja vu! It happened again! I am a plumbing contractor, and due to the economy, I need to go where the work is. I was in Southern California working, when I got a call from my roommate that he opened the Comcast cable bill as asked by me, and it stated that I owe $470.94. This was for January ($235) and February's bill. On February 29, I paid the due amount of $235.47 with my credit card. I did not know yet that that there had been an additional rate increase or why my bill was so high. I simply planned to look into it when I returned home.When I did return home, I called Comcast and asked why my bill was so much. They informed me that my rate went up an additional $60.00 per month (again). That I was enjoying a $60.00 per month reduced rate and now I'm back to the normal rate of $169.99 with tax, etc. This came to $235.00 roughly. A second rate increase? I was told that last year! I thought if this continues, I will be paying $700.00 for service within just a few years. I mean can they legally up my rate every year? I have (2) televisions, a phone line, and internet (only). I called Comcast again, and after having the same type of conversations with them as I did during my first rate increase, I got nowhere and decided to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Several days after filing that complaint, I received a phone call from a Comcast dispute resolution worker. She and I spent about an hour and a half going over my billing statements and information. I gave her the serial numbers to all my equipment provided by Comcast. At the end, I was promised the following:I had already paid January's bill of $235.47. She asked me to eat that! She would reduce the additional (February) bill to an $89.99 charge. She would put me back on a plan with a rate of $89.99 per month. I got rid of my fax line ($11.99 per month). I would either return the DVR box or, start using it. On 04/04/12, I bought a new flatscreen TV. (I have the receipt purchased at Wal-Mart.) She would credit the fees charged for the prior 26 months of the DVR. She would credit the fees charged for the modem (I bought my own.) for 26 months.I was to receive several hundred dollars in credits and be back on the original plan I signed up for at a rate of $89.99. All was resolved (I thought) and my next bill should have had nice credits, etc. When I received the next bill, I noticed that only partial credits were applied. The fax line was deleted, the rate plan back to $89.99, and so on. However, there's no DVR (26 months), credit, etc. My current bill did state that I owed $2.20 however it's due April. But, they did not take off, credit, or even reduce the $233.37 (February) amount as promised. They still wanted it. My April bill was $2.20 with an outstanding amount of $233.37. I did not pay the $2.20, hoping I would see the promised credits. On May 1, I sent Comcast a check for $126.17 (the current bill for May). On May 8, Comcast shut off all my service because of the $233.37 amount that was supposed to be credited. On May 8, I had several early morning conversations with customer service people who got nowhere. They're very rude people who said I could not talk to a supervisor, corporate person, or even the woman who called me and I had thought worked out all the issues with me. I was told that they would not even discuss any issues with me, until I paid the $233.37 (second rate increase). I overpaid the $235.47 as asked. (I ate it.) I have been overcharged per agreement for 26 months. I paid for services and equipment I never had or used respectfully. I have gone so far out of my way to not only resolve this matter but compromise financially when I shouldn't have had to. In short, Comcast has knowingly ripped me off a second time and is saying loud and clear that there is nothing you can do about it! After the first unwarranted rate increase and knowing I was being overcharged for services and equipment, which is plainly and simply a consumer scam, I gave up and stopped complaining. But to have this happen again and even more blatant and expensive is criminal. My business relies on the internet and my business phone. This has affected me greatly. Total: $846.00*I paid the $235.47 for January and had my rate reduced back to $89.99. However, Comcast's bill does not reflect this for February. Additionally and very importantly, I noticed on my current bill that Comcast again intends to increase my rate next year to $179.99. With tax and so on, this would amount to a monthly service to $245.00 for television, internet, and a phone line. I also saw several polls where thousands of Comcast customers were polled and Comcast receiving as low as a 1% favorable customer satisfaction rate. This is unbelievably outrageous!*This excludes any credits they have given me, because those credits were other or additional overcharges; i.e., modem fees, etc."
"Robert of Antioch, TN",5/18/2012,,"First, I arranged to have cable TV installed and while the guy was here, I mentioned once my current internet contract was up, I wanted to switch to Comcast. I was told by him that if I got the internet while he was there, I would save the $49.95 service charge. So I went ahead and had it set up. Well, guess what? I got my first bill and that $49.95 was on the bill. I called and filed a complaint 3 days ago and still no reply from Comcast. Second, I received a call. Several days after my installation, I received 3 calls from a lady named Lea from Comcast. First off, she called during the day hours and I work nights so she had left messages to call back. I called back the first 2 times and no one at Comcast knew what she was calling for. The third time she called, she threatened me. She stated that if I did not call her and do a 5-min. voice verification on the package I was getting, that she would assign me a package of her choice. I do not like being threatened and especially by a service I am paying for. Comcast employees forget we are customers. So the last time she called, I called Comcast again and the guy finally figured out what they wanted and sent me to an automated system that asked me general questions without any explanation. ""Do you agree to the terms?"" but did not state the terms. Half asleep because I had worked all night, I agreed just to keep this lady from calling and waking me up every day and stop her from changing the service I had requested. Of course, Comcast has not called to apologize for her behavior but luckily I kept her angry threats on my voice mail and will be consulting an attorney and media. This is outrageous. Is Comcast really that desperate that they have to threaten customers now?"
"toni of Galesburg, IL",5/19/2012,,"I have had this service for two years and I have never been late on a payment. Last week, my Internet and cable went down eight times in one day the week before twice. Yesterday, it went out before noon and did not come back up until 7:00 pm and was done again this morning. I called them many times. Of course, it is a mess getting through since they have four numbers and no local number. They all insisted there was no outage and wanted me to go through all of that nonsense they have you do. I told the girl that I had already done this 15 times and yes it was an outage. I called back and a young man told me, ""Yes, there was an outage.""I called this morning and no outage. Yet, Comcast trucks were down the road because there was an outage. I work online, go to school online and lost money so I had to get a hotel just to get online. This is ridiculous and we are demanding something to be done here. Comcast has the monopoly on this small area so I am stuck with it."
"Sadiq of Alexandria, VA",5/21/2012,,"I wanted to get internet service from Comcast cable services. I checked myself the availability of the Comcast service at my address and got the answer online that the service is available. So the next day, I called on the number 877-417-0922. My call was, after some time, answered by a person who called himself Kenneth. After taking all my information, he told me that I will get internet service at $29.99 and a free router and modem. Then he said, ""you will pay for the two said devices and you will get the paid amount back as a rebate"". After this, he said ""you will have to pay for the shipment $19.99"". Then he said, ""you will not get the shipment amount back"". The total amount he made was $199.93. He took all my credit card information. There was not enough amount in my bank so I offered him another card and told him to get the total amount from the two cards. He told me that I will pay double shipment if I have to use two cards for payment. I did not want that so I rushed and deposited some cash in the bank to make the payment from one card. After making the payment, he started offering me more of his offers from AT&T security and tried to connect me to the AT&T security people. I told him that I have been on the phone for about two hours and I was late for my job, I will do that tomorrow. So then he connected me to the installation department to setup the date for installation. The man who talked to me from the installation department called himself Steve, told me that my computer shows that Comcast service is not available at my address. After too much discussion, he told me that I should cancel my order from the sales department. So I called back to the sales department and found on the phone a person called William. William told me that the installation department people may be confused and that we have the service in that area and connected me back to installation department. This time, I found another person called Espo. Espo said there is no service at my address. I tried to reach Kenneth, the first person whom I had talked and who had taken all my credit card information to cancel the deal, but I could not get to him. When I reached for my job, I was two hours late. At my job, my cell phone started ringing. I had told Kenneth that I am unable to pick any call when at my job. I tried to call back, but nobody picked my call. The next day, I got a message from my cell phone company that I have used all my minutes and I need to refill my account. The next day, I called the number 877-405-5035 and talked to a lady whose name was either Rem or Allisan. She told me that I still can get the rebate. She told me to fill the forms online and send it for rebate. The form for rebate was asking for the date of installation, but I haven't been given the date of installation by the Comcast people because they are not going to install the service to me. There is much more to say because I have talked to some other people in Comcast. Please do not do this. Please be truthful."
"Kristine of Highlands Ranch, CO",5/21/2012,,"I split time between two homes in CO and FL. I have Comcast in CO and decided that I would get it in Cape Coral. When they came out to install, there was no information left regarding channels or any account information. The installer said Comcast would mail this to me. The first day, the cable and internet went out 3 times; the first being for an hour and the second time for a few minutes. The third time, it was out at least until one in the morning when I finally gave up and went to sleep. I called Comcast that night complaining and they told me that it would be up and running soon. The next day, my services (internet and cable) did return. That night, they stopped again but only for about 5 minutes. It was still irritating. That week my service was in and out. I had a supervisor contact me saying I would not be charged for that time period it was out. This kept happening and I was even told at one point that the cable was not out. I was told it was my equipment but my neighbor had Comcast also and confirmed hers was also out. The beginning of the second week, I called to cancel because I could not take anymore. I was given a location to bring back my equipment. I got to the location and it was no longer there. I called on my cell phone and they gave me another location. It was not there either. The third time, I was very upset; I was wasting gas on a provider whose service was crap. I finally got hold of a different rep and they sent me to a location that was actually open. I made sure I received a receipt for my equipment. I made sure I talked to a rep and go names. I was told since I cancelled within 30 days, I would not be charged and that because of the headache, I would not have to pay for installation. I got another bill. I called and the rep said it does not look like my account got closed out properly and that she would do this now. She said she was unable to put into the computer the actual day I did call (even though I have my receipt returning my equipment) but since I was still within 30 days that I was still not going to be charged. Once again, I got a bill. I called and was very pissed by now. The rep said it was taken care of and she saw the notes in the computer and to ignore the billing. Guess what happened? I got a letter from a debt agency telling I owe a debt and it will be reported on my credit report.I am beyond upset by now but I paid it because I have A credit and was worried. I call Comcast again. They tole me I would hear back by the proper department regarding this within 1 to 6 business days. I have yet for anyone to call me back. I contacted Rick ** via his page that guarantees you will be satisfied. No word except a email saying we have received your letter and someone will contact you shortly. That was weeks ago. It is upsetting that this company who I still pay for service in Colorado is a fraud. They do not guarantee anything and they hide from their customers. I am one of those people who do not like a big government involvement in companies but when you have companies like this taking advantage of companies, it really makes me change my mind. I hope that some action is done to stop this company from preying on others. I have watched my fees here in CO go up and I would have to pay to get out of my service. As soon as my contract is done, I am done with this provider. The fact that they can wreck someone's credit makes me ill."
"Bobbi of Exeter, NH",5/23/2012,,"I am not sure who will ever read this. I was compelled to write about my frustration. I am a 50 year old divorced woman living in Exeter, NH. Comcast is our local cable provider. Three years ago, I was divorced from my husband of 23 years. He left the area (in haste) moving to Arkansas. Unbeknownst to me the cable services were in his name. The reason I was not aware of this was because I went to the cable company and they changed the bill to my name and never informed me that the account was in his name. The problem came this January when I went to reduce my services to just internet. I was informed that I could not reduce services because he had moved back to the area and had services at his new home as well as my residence in his name. Also, I was informed that he had full access to my phone records as well as my emails through Comcast. This was very disheartening because I have an order of protection that was granted during the divorce, which I had previously taken into the Exeter, NH office and showed the office staff. The result of this was changing the bill to my name yet keeping the account in his name. I was not informed of this and always felt that I was the owner of the account. After calling Comcast numerous times (the number was from the bill), I was informed that I could not even have a repairman come to my home to service the cable I was paying for. This was ironic because I have had repairmen out at least 4 times for problems dealing with the phone and computer services. So, since January of this year, I have personally entered the office seeking help. I now know where my ex-husband was getting information on me which your company allowed him. I am very frustrated that I (as the person paying the bill) was never informed that he had access to my account. This frustration only multiplied in the fact no one would let me disconnect the services. My only option was to allow the account to go into default. On Monday evening of this week, I again called Comcast. The difference was this time I raised my voice, swore and cried out of anger. This time, I finally got results. Why is it that you need to raise your voice and act like a lunatic for this company to listen? Being polite and courteous seemed to lead me to a brick wall. I could no longer stand for everyone knowing my business served on a platter catered by Comcast. I had to pay the back bills (even though I did not utilize the services nor wanted them). But if it brought me freedom from this mess, so be it! This morning the Comcast office in Exeter, NH called me (after dealing with me every day trying to turn off my services) to ask when I wanted to have my services turned on! Seriously!"
"Edward of Corryton, TN",5/25/2012,,"Comcast is too big to care about its customers. I am paying every single month for 12Mbps download and 3Mbps upload. Yet, when doing several speed tests for Comcast Xfinity, my download speed ranged from 0.40Mbps to 1.81Mbps download and 0.58Mbps to 0.76Mbps upload. When I called and asked Comcast why it was so slow, the customer service lady said I could pay another $10 a month to upgrade to 12Mbps download and 5Mbps upload. I told her I was not even getting what I was paying for now, so why would I want to pay them more money for something I'm not even getting now?"
"Larry of Walled lake, MI",5/28/2012,,"Fake Commercial - Comcast says they credit your bill for $20 if they're late. That's a lie. When I called Comcast to tell them, their repairman just pulled up in my driveway 15 minutes late. Comcast said it's the repairman that makes that call if he is late, so he lied to his boss and said he was in the driveway for 15 minutes before coming in the house - another lie. I watched him pull into my driveway 15 min. late, but all he has to do is tell his boss he was in the driveway and you will never get your $20 credit."
"Lesley of Sunnyvale, CA",5/29/2012,,"I contacted Comcast to transfer service. I was told that I will be paying the exact same price at my new address as I paid on April 2011. I have the transcript with the rep as proof. Comcast has raised my rates and claimed that it's promotional. I gave them the transcript showing they said the same rate, not promotional rate. They said sorry. I have written proof of the price given to me that they will not honor. Isn't Comcast viewed as anti-competitive yet? They tell consumers one thing and charge another; however, the consumer does not have another option for cable. My apartment building does not allow satellite dishes. Thank you."
"John of Galveston, TX",5/29/2012,,"I signed up for internet and phone service. A little more than two weeks after I had had the service for a year, I called up to cancel the phone service, but was told that was not possible and that my service had been automatically renewed. I have bought phone and internet service many times from many companies, including Comcast in the past, but I have never heard of such a horrible practice. It's deceptive. No one ever said that the service would be automatically renewed. It was not spelled out in the agreement. It's also unreasonable and unethical."
"Marina of Femont, ca",5/30/2012,,"Early this afternoon, I heard voices in my backyard. I looked out my bedroom window and lo and behold, there were two men standing there having a conversation. I went through my house and ran out to question them. One had left and the other said he was with Comcast and was looking to see how he could get onto the pole that, by the way, is not in my yard, but the neighboring yard. I questioned him as to how he gained access to my yard and he told me that he had talked to my ""daughter"" and that she opened the gate for him and from my neighbor (whom I assumed was the other man). I told him that was not okay and he started telling me about the ""easement law"". I cut him off and told him I knew about the law and I also knew about the law where you are not to come into an agreement with a child to gain access into a home or yard. He told me he did not come into an agreement, but that he had a conversation with her and she let them in. I told him he was to ask an adult, not a child and how dare he give access into my yard to a stranger, also without my consent! He excused himself and told me he would gain access from another neighbor's yard and I agreed that would be the right thing. He never apologized and he never did any work on the pole that he supposedly was in my yard to work on. I am very angry about this person, who never showed me any kind of identification from Comcast, trespassing onto my personal property and inviting others as well then trying to use the easement law against me."
"Cass of Ocala, fl",5/30/2012,,"A bundled package was purchased and installed on 06-29-2011. Part of that bundled promotion was that the consumer would receive a $200.00 gift card ninety days later. To date, I have not received the gift card and Comcast continues to provide me with the number to their call center that handles distributing gift cards. After contacting the center on several occasions, I was given a tracking number and advised they are waiting to hear back from Comcast. But after contacting Comcast, they only direct me to the call center."
"Elaine of Houston, TX",6/1/2012,,"Picture is non-existent or scrambled like a jigsaw puzzle. After 45 minutes or so on the phone with a service tech, I was told we have faulty equipment but they would send a stronger signal to get a picture. Today is the third day this week this has happened. They now want to send someone out in a couple of days to change out a box. I had a prior appointment that morning and was told if I couldn't be available at that time, it would be a later day before it could be rescheduled. I have no picture until the tech changes the box."
"HARRY of Jensen beach, fl",6/3/2012,,"I called tech support on Thursday, 5/31/2012, to report my internet service out. The tech on the phone walked me through several troubleshooting steps but could not get the system running. He made an appointment for home repair for Saturday, June 2, 2012 between 1-3pm. I made it extremely clear to him that my home phone was also out due to no internet service. I told him the only phone they could reach me on was my cell phone. He understood and made a change of phone number on the work order. Saturday morning, I made a call to tech support to make sure they had the right phone number on the work order. The lady assured me that it was 3pm, Saturday. No service tech. I called tech support, talked to a Curt. He assured me that his tech was just late, be patient and he would be here. I also reminded him of the number to reach me. He said yes the tech had the right number. Curt also told me congratulations. Because the tech was late, Comcast was going to credit my account $20. How nice but guess what, no truck ever came. I called Comcast and got a recording saying our service was cancelled because the tech could not reach us. Guess what number they were calling, my home number that didnâ€™t work. Back on phone, I got a live woman from Georgia. She called me Mr. ** and told me she would solve my problem. She got me another appointment for Sunday, June 3, 2012 at 8-9 am. She positively assured that the problem was solved. She made it fool proof for the tech to call the wrong number. She even gave me another $20 and 6 months of HBO free. Sunday morning 9am, no service tech. You arenâ€™t surprised to hear that right. Does this Groundhog Day the movie called Comcast at 9am? The woman I spoke to said, oh I know what the problem is. The bad computer doesnâ€™t know that your home phone doesnâ€™t work. She said I will fix it. I will take that bad number out of the computer and enter my cell number. No more mistakes. The woman assured me I would hear from the tech within 3 hours to give me his arrival time. Eight hours later and guess what, no call, no service tech. I just canâ€™t believe that there are that many people employed at Comcast that donâ€™t remotely know how to order repair service or just donâ€™t care. The old 8 and skate crowd."
"Rajanarayanan of Dayton, NJ",6/3/2012,,"Comcast Xfinity service is abysmal - I switched back to Comcast from Verizon after 3 years when the salesman promised that things are different now after they started with their Xfinity service. There were initial hiccups for sure when I considered opting out as they had the 30-day guarantee, but I stuck with it. It seemed to get a little better over time but then, the problem started with the phone service that most Xfinity triple play customers are now familiar with - you can hear the other party but they cannot hear you a few minutes into the call and you need to redial. Comcast has not been able to do anything about it. There were disruptions of internet service but except on a few days, it was alright. Yesterday (June 1, 2012), there was a major outage for 3 or 4 hours and when I called Comcast, they said the problem affected our area (Dayton, NJ) and technicians were working on it but could not give an ETA for resolution. The service did come back later but for the last 24+ hours, I've been having interruptions on phone service every few minutes when the line goes dead without a dial tone. The internet cuts off as well, and I have been recycling the modem every few minutes. I think Comcast does not have the wherewithal to run a huge data network and their technicians are the least knowledgeable in data networking. I am terribly mad and am thinking of switching out regardless of their termination fee. I rely on internet service for work. God knows how they are able to advertise high speed internet service for businesses when they are unable to deliver a decent service to households. I will never recommend their service - No internet and no phone service from Comcast - to anyone (except their TV)."
"Chris of Hamtramck, MI",6/3/2012,,"On June 2, 2012, a Comcast tech came to the next door neighbor's house to do some work. His truck was parked in front of my home and he was unloading his tools all over my lawn as usual. And, as usual, when he left, his trash was also left behind on my lawn. Plastic clips, wires, etc. were just left with no thought of picking up his garbage and taking it with him. We take care of our property and to have a professional work like this is truly amazing and disgusting. Would this guy like stuff left on his property especially when he did not get any work done? This has happened more than once. I think Comcast needs to train these techs on how to clean up after themselves or if they can't understand, show them!"
"Angelo of Houston, tx",6/6/2012,,"Last month, I noticed my phone was not working. I called the Customer Service and reported my phone not working. I was told by the technician that I don't have that # anymore because they have given it to some other provider. I asked who gave the permission. They had no answer. All they can tell is someone called and said to do it. I asked, ""Did you verify was that me?"" They did not have an answer. I told him, ""I am the primary account holder and I am supposed to make decisions, and I have not requested for any changes as I am satisfied with the present service, not to mention I believe I do pay my bill on or before the due date. So please correct this fault as soon as possible."" I signed triple package on October 15th, 2010. It was 2 years which completes in November 2012. Then, we will be given new option for the next 2 years, which I am planning to do when the time arrives. So, please, correct this problem immediately. It will be greatly appreciated. Also, I have talked to many customer service supervisors. Everyone said they fixed or are fixing the problem but it has not been done yet."
"Sally of Richmond, VA",6/7/2012,,"After moving from Richmond, VA, we were sent a prepaid label to return our computer router and wireless adapter. We mailed them in immediately after receiving the label. Luckily, I kept the receipt from UPS because approximately three weeks later, we received a collections notice. The notice told us that Comcast had contacted them in regards to us owing money for the equipment, stating it had never been returned. When I contacted Comcast, they admitted to submitting us to a collection agency without notifying us of any issue. They also looked up our records and found that they showed that we had, indeed, returned the equipment. I received no apologies and was told that it would take a week for the information to be removed from our account and for the collections agency to stop calling us/sending notices. I'm beyond livid at their mistake and lack of human compassion."
"Kevin of Maplewood, MN",6/8/2012,,"When choosing an internet provider, I liked the Comcast's price and the service. I spoke with a sales rep from the company, Lyn **, and she told me that the transfer process from Century Link would be ""seamless"" and our services will be down for a max. of about 5 min and that we would have to cancel our Century Link Internet (I have e-mail record). The tech came to switch our phone numbers and added cable internet. He looked at our system and said, ""I cannot touch that phone system"" (it is a POPP system). I was baffled because I informed Lyn that we had a POPP phone system. He informed me that we would need to hire a phone tech to work while another Comcast tech came. This cost us an additional $150 and totally wasted my day because I had cleared my afternoon to assist the tech. We had the phone tech come out and the Comcast tech (who was 10 mins late) and set up our phones and internet. All was fine. No problems other than the tech messed with my routers and killed our database for good. We have a domain name and we use the domain for our e-mail. I came to work on Monday after the switch and found out that we were still using Century Link internet servers for our e-mail. I thought, ""Great. I will pay for both services and switch the domain name from Century Link during the weekend when we will have no e-mails going through, thus making the switch seamless."" Well, to my surprise, when I came in to work on Wednesday, Comcast had suspended our services from Century Link (without our permission) and we had no e-mail server/service. I am in the sales business and no e-mail means no orders received. I called Comcast and they said, ""No problem. We will just add your domain to your account."" Great. He walked me through setting up the vanity domain name and then instructed me to go through our host server (**) and have them add our new, **, and target value. The process was supposed to take 24 hours, but could take up to 48. Not so great. After 24 hours, I called the Host to ask if all the information was ""propagated"" and the tech said, ""It should all have been sent sometime last night."" So, he said it is Comcast who was in error. The blame game begins. I call Comcast and they say that it has to be the Host who has not sent the information. After about 7 phone calls and 4 hours, I finally got a manager to talk to at Comcast, Jason out of the Denver office. He said he would call the host company and figure out what is going on and call me back in 2 hours. 2 hours came and went. I angrily went home. Now, it is day 3 (still with no e-mails) and the domain name is still ""provisioning."" I called Comcast and asked to speak to a different manager because Jason lied to me and never called me back (and the host said he never called them either). Now, I deal with the manager whose name is Dustin. He said that Jason had ""escalated"" the ticket to their Tier 2 techs yesterday and it will be 48 hours until I will get a response. I got upset because this issue has already been going on 48 hours and it would appear on my end that they have done nothing. I finally got Dustin to talk to our host (had to make a conference call) and Dustin said he would have his Tier 3 tech call them and figure out what is going on. He said I should receive a response in about 2 hours. I waited 2 and got a call from the Tier 3 tech, Kris (after 48 hours, you would think it would already be at Tier 3). He said it had something to do with Century Link not releasing the domain. He said he would work on it and give me a call back. I then called Century Link and asked if Comcast had called in regards to our account. They informed me that they had no record of receiving a call from Comcast regarding our domain name. Finally, Kris called me at about 3:30 and informed me that the problem was on their end and he didn't know why they would not propagate the domain name. He said he would have to send a message to the manager (I am assuming Dustin) to tell the other techs to ""get their ** in gear, "" basically saying it was Comcast's issue the whole time. So, to sum it all up, 3 days with no e-mail (we figured we lost about $1000 a day at least in orders), my staff who cannot do their job for three days (their job is e-mailing customers and receiving orders via e-mail) thus about another $500 in pay lost, and I made at least 20 phone calls to our host, Century Link and Comcast. When I spoke to Dustin regarding compensation due to the fact that Comcast did not do their job and also told us that the transition would be ""seamless,"" he said simply, ""we don't do that."" I am very unhappy with how the situation was handled by Comcast, how the sales associate lied to us and how the only thing anybody did was finger point on whose problem it was. Also, now I have to work overtime on the weekend to get our e-mail back on track (that is assuming they have fixed it by tomorrow morning). If I were to grade my Comcast experience so far, it would be an F for Fail."
"samianne of Middlebury, CT",6/9/2012,,"Two years have passed and I still have not received my netbook promised to me for signing up. First, it was ""didn't pay bill on time."" When that turned out to be false, it was ""didn't sign a contract."" Bad, bad people."
"MIchelle of Rincon, GA",6/9/2012,,"I signed up for auto pay for my Comcast account. They took out the payment in March and applied it to my Comcast account. They took out $116 in April but did not apply it to my Comcast account. In May, they took $240 because they never applied April's payment. I called and the rep apologized and said she would get the payment posted and credited the late fee. In June, they took out $305 because the previous 2 payments were never applied. I called customer service and they didn't see any of the 3 payments posted to my account. They told me to call my bank to see where the money went. I had already done this and told the rep that per my bank it was withdrawn from my checking account by Comcast. I asked for a supervisor and was told that the supervisor wouldn't be able to help. I asked that they do me the courtesy of allowing me to try. The supervisor came on and said that Comcast never got payment and she couldn't help but would open a ticket. It would take 3-5 days to investigate.I went to my bank and got proof that the money was withdrawn, called for a fax number and faxed this info to Comcast in Philadelphia. I sent an email to customer service explaining the above and received a response stating it takes up to 45 days for auto pay to start and to be patient and Comcast would withdraw the payment! I responded to the email asking them to read the email I sent again. Comcast has no problem withdrawing the money; it's applying it to my account they can't manage. I received another email response stating I should go to a service center. I responded telling them the only way I would go to a service center would be on my way to sign up with DirecTV.I called customer service 2 days later and was told the ticket was closed because they found the $305 payment and my account was now up to date. I asked about the other 2 payments and she said they couldn't find them! The rep said she would reopen the ticket. It has been a week and I can't get anyone at Comcast to help me get back my $356 overpayment. I called Comcast and asked to have my service disconnected. The rep I was transferred to asked why and I explained. He said ""it takes up to 45 days to activate auto withdraw,"" and said I should be patient. I told him to cancel my service and to learn to listen. I am now left with no option but to file a claim in small claims court to get my money back."
"Curtis of Spring, TX",6/9/2012,,"I received my set top box yesterday by UPS from Comcast, which is a Cisco RNG100 box. It would not activate. Between yesterday and today, I've talked with seven people for about 4 1/2 to 5 hours. The live chat was completely disgusting. It took me 40 minutes to get a direct answer to one question. I gave up on that. I had ordered TV service a few days ago, which was in my account according to one tech person, but then not in my account according to another one. All the people I talked to were nice, but not very knowledgeable. They would often apologize for the problems I was having, but that is hollow when it is not resolved. This morning, after I talked to a tech man for two hours, he said he would call right back with an appointment for someone to come on site. He did not call. I was dropped once in passing me off. Once I was passed off to three people, with much waiting in between and no resolution, just apologies and empty promises. Then I had to reorder the TV package. One tech person had me check the splitters outside, which all seem to be in order. I have internet service with Comcast that works fine. The phone call I made last night during a storm said my internet was out, it was not. Then, their site said my TV was working, it was not. Now I'm supposed to have an appointment to get this resolved. If he does not show, I'm cancelling the TV. When the company was Road Runner, the service was excellent. Since Comcast bought them out, it is below horrible."
"Janice of Westminster, MA",6/20/2012,,"I called to set up a payment arrangement on 6/18/2012. The payment was to be withdrawn from my checking account on 6/22/2012. The payment was withdrawn immediately. I called Comcast and spoke to several people in multiple departments, including a supervisor. I informed the supervisor that the early withdrawal would cause other outstanding checks to bounce, causing me embarrassment and many dollars in fees. They informed me that there was no record on the computer of my intent to pay on the 22nd. So, I said, that doesn't change the error. They refused to reverse the payment. I told them I would be taking any overage fees from my next Comcast bill and was told they would disconnect my service. She said they have no policy of accepting payments made in the future. Not my issue if the representative is not trained properly, she accepted the date of payment. When I asked to speak to someone else, she chuckled and said she'd look for someone. Then I was disconnected."
"Dana of Memphis, TN",6/21/2012,,"In April 2012, we had wireless internet installed. It took close to a month after installation of constant phone calls to get it operating properly. In the meantime, our cable would freeze up constantly in our den. We could watch maybe four channels. Upon calling Comcast, I was told this was a common problem that the internet service interferes with the cable and that the original installers should have installed an amplifier on the cable. They'd send someone out at X time to get it fixed, could I be there? Of course, I replied, ""Yes, I'd be there."" Technician came out, installed amplifier and re-iterated that the original installers had not done the job correctly. There would be no charge. Fast forward to my bill this month. I am set up on auto pay and my notifications showed my bill would be debited on day x for $151. On X day, $201 was deducted from my account. I immediately logged into Comcast to find the difference, but was unable to view my bill online. Another issue, I'd called about and tried to resolve for the past three months. Finally, I spoke to someone that cleared that problem up but billing told me there was a pending charge of $50 for the service charge. Until it hit my statement, they could not even discuss it. My response was if they couldn't discuss a pending charge, how could they debit it out of bank account? Billing told me I was not on auto pay. My response, ""I'm looking at the auto debit out of my account."" Finally, billing told me they could not reverse the charge as that was policy for any service charge. I repeated, one, I was not told I would be charged and two, the technician said I would not be charged as this was a Comcast error. Billing's response is, ""You don't have service protection plan. The charge stands."" I asked to speak to a supervisor and was disconnected. I called right back and went the through the above again. This time, I was at least told that it would be turned over to a supervisor and the supervisor would call me back within 2 hours.Fast forward to this morning. No call from supervisor and I have called billing again, only to be met with the same brick wall, ""We will not remove or credit the charge. You don't have a service agreement."" At which point, I informed the rep that I had never heard of a service agreement before yesterday nor had I ever been offered a service agreement. I demanded that I be allowed to speak with a supervisor. I got put on hold for 10 minutes, then the rep came back on the line and told me the supervisor said the charge would stand. I again asked to speak to the supervisor or the supervisor's supervisor. The rep responded, ""Why? I told you there's nothing we can do."" I insisted and was then transferred to someone's voicemail. I left a message and of course, no one has called me back at this time."
"Fashuna  of Rosharon, TX",6/23/2012,,"Comcast specified an amount due immediately to reconnect the service, only to find out there is additional amount required to activate the service! This is misleading and a blatant lie! I'm very angry with this company and its manipulative ways. I plan on looking into another provider that will be honest! Clearly, this CEO does not care about its consumers! It's sad that people are so money hungry to the point that they deceive the very people that keep them in business!"
"Cherilynn of New Hudson, MI",6/23/2012,,"I can't even begin to describe what I have gone through with this company. Since day one, they have been like a Hollywood movie. The stuff they have put me through is unbelievable. At certain points in time, I document what goes on. What makes this really sad is I am disabled and really need service not only for cognitive help, but for safety reasons too. This last episode going on since May 22, 2012 has to be bordering on illegal and defiantly discriminating.Comcast is charging me $149 per month for no service. In the last year, a dozen or so managers were supposed to call me back. It didn't happen. When I do get supervisors/managers, they say they are going to help me, never to hear from them again and their phone number is soon disconnected. Comcast's catastrophic problem phone line doesn't answer. They are so messed up I hear you never get the same answer twice. Even when you talk to a dozen Comcast employees in one day, they never give you the same answer. My modem has been changed over 6 times. I could go on and on of what they have done to me but it's useless and overwhelming. In three weeks, I was on the phone with Comcast 1378 minutes on my cellphone and had to buy more minutes to talk to them. In addition, there were four techs on as many different days in my house with obnoxious customer service skills. This has to be the worst company ever and consumers cannot do anything about them. It seems like the FCC or local governments get so much lobbying money from Comcast, there is not help anywhere. Give me regulated Ma Bell back!"
"Mike of Girdletree, MD",6/23/2012,,"I have had Comcast for years, and I paid my bills on time each month. They always took the money out the 22nd of the month, because I am disabled and my money does not go into the bank till the 3rd Wednesday of the month. Well, this month, they took it out on the 14th; and I got an overdraft from my bank. It cost me $30.00 more. I called Comcast, and they said it was my bank that changed when the money was to be taken out. So I said, ""Ok, let me get my bank on the phone while I have you on the line."" (I got 2 phone lines in the home.) So I called my bank, and I am good friends with the bank manager. I put them both on speaker phones, and I asked the women from Comcast to please say again what she told me. She did, and the bank manager told her no and that we do not have any control of that because it is when they (Comcast) send out the bank draft. The women called him a liar and hung up on us.I called back and asked to speak to a supervisor. They told me none was available and that one would call me back within 2 hours. Well, I did not get a call back. So, I called them again the next day, and the automatic recorder went through its program and proceeded to now tell me that I owe a past due balance of $137.19. But my bill has always been $77.47. I got another person on the phone, and she proceeded to tell me I owe them for service that has been done because nothing was working right in my home and Comcast came out and wired my whole house when it was completely gutted and remodeled a few years back. I was told by the service man that was just at my home last week that it was done wrong and that he had to change things around. He drilled holes through my house walls and broke a set of my very cherished wine glasses that were custom-made for me. And all that was said was I did not see them.Now today 6/22/12, I had talked with another company rep, who had called me to ask about my service. If they do not want to know how I was treated, then why call and ask, because I let her know how I was treated and that I was very upset. But it seemed like she could also care less! Let me tell you one thing. It seems when you have problems with this company and you call to try to get things worked out, you piss them off and you end up getting a higher bill for whatever they can charge you for. So now, I have 3 boxes that were to be free, and now, I am being charged for each one. Plus, if the boxes don't work and I have to call to get someone out to get them working, I get charged for it now. But I did do one thing. I filed a complaint with the FCC. But most likely, they will sit on their asses and do nothing also. So, I called my bank back and told them to no longer let Comcast take any money out of my account. I am going to file on Monday with the Better Business and any one else I can think off. I hope no one else is being treated like this. But from all the complaints I have read, it is happening all over with every one with Comcast. What is going on with this company?"
"Michelle  of Fort Wayne, IN",6/27/2012,,"In March 2011, I joined a leads group from the Fort Wayne Chamber of Commerce. My sister and I were getting ready to open up a gift store in downtown Fort Wayne. A representative from Comcast was a member of that leads group. She talked to us about a great deal Comcast was offering at that time - $129 for 2 phone lines and internet service. Knowing we were going to need these services for our gift store, I told her I was interested and she gladly set everything up for me. She never once mentioned anything about a $300 installation fee or having to sign a three-year contract. She had me sign for the service.After the services were installed, I received a bill for over $400 and was shocked. I did pay the bill even though I was upset she never mentioned the installation fee. Today, June 27, 2012, I called to cancel the service since my sister and I are closing our gift store. That's when I was told I signed a three-year contract and I would have to pay a $2,000 fee to get out of the contract! I was beyond shocked! First of all, she never even mentioned that I was signing a three-year contract. I never would have signed a three-year contract because my lease was only for two-years!This Comcast representative never mentioned anything in regards to not being able to cancel this service at will. It's very deceptive and after reading the thousands of complaints, I'm not sure where to turn. A supervisor was supposed to call or email me but nothing. I want to nip this in the bud now before this turns into something that drags on for months. I don't trust them as far as I can throw them!"
"Dorothea of Acworth, GA",6/28/2012,,"I have had Comcast for over a year. My On Demand goes out constantly. After having the techs out 3 times, it was decided that my wiring in the wall is bad. I live in an apartment complex and they don't wish to replace the wiring. Comcast solution, you pay for it. In the meantime, I pay $121 a month for basic service and internet, top dollar. They told me they would credit some of my payment back; however, because the problem is not resolved (I won't pay for new wiring), they refuse to credit anything. They had already promised me they would credit the account previous to the tech coming out. So I am stuck with On Demand that works 40 percent of the time and I am charged top dollar."
"Jessica of East Brunswick, NJ",6/28/2012,,"Ever since my husband and I purchased our house, Comcast has been bothering us to find out why we disconnected our service. We keep telling them the old lady who used to own the house died and her kids canceled the account before they put the house up for sale. We have never had Comcast. Now, we get a salesman at our front door every few weeks (same guy) and he's so pushy and argumentative. Today, he tells me that I don't know what I'm talking about with my current service (DirecTV) and that I'm thinking of something else. I told him last time we asked to never be visited again by a salesperson and he said the message never got to him. But he was the one my husband told about! I want to ream that company out, but they make it impossible to contact them except to sign up. My husband and I are very technical and we know exactly what we're paying for. He's never going to swindle us into something by telling us our internet will be fast or that we want TV channels we don't watch. We did our research before we chose a service provider. Each time they come to our door, they are pretty much ensuring a little bit more than last time that I will never ever buy their products."
"Sunshine of Oakland, CA",6/30/2012,,"I don't like Comcast telling me I gotta pay my bill a month in advance! I've got 5 kids and my baby, Daddy, don't got no job! We just bought a 60"" plasma and the ** at Comcast, Hector ""I don't speak English so good"", told me I was in ""soft disco"" and I had like 3 weeks to pay before they sent a guy out to shut me off at my house! Hector told me I was still getting billed and it's because during this time they don't charge you like $50 to turn your service back on like PGE does. This is totally wrong!This is the 4th time this year they did this to my babies. I asked if I could pay $20 of the $379 I owe so they could put it back on for a day and the guy was so rude and didn't care that my family needs to watch TV and go on the computer to watch cartoons and stuff. I told him to give me a manager and he was like so rude and said he would get me one, but then this guy in Sales picked up and had no clue that Hector was talking to me! So, the sales guy wouldn't do anything except tell me that tomorrow I will be shut off for nonpayment and if I want it back on, I have to pay the past due, a reconnect charge and I have to pay one month in advance to show I mean to pay them on time!He didn't want to talk to me so he did get me a mgr, but the mgr didn't act like they cared! I told her about how I don't have money now b/c we had to buy a new TV and Blu-ray and why should I have to pay them so much? She told me maybe I should give up my premieres like HBO, Showtime, and Cinemax and Stars and my 4 DVRs. That is **! She told me I could add a phone to get a better deal on a promotion, but I don't need their ** phone. I got 3 smartphones and what's up with that?Comcast acts like b/c I'm on family assistance, I have to give up my TVs and lifestyle! They won't even let me order PPV and fights for my daddy b/c they say I don't pay my bill on time! Omg, they made me put this number on my TV so ""nobody can order movies if I don't want!"" It doesn't work. They keep adding porns to my bill and saying we are doing it. Liars, you're going to burn in hell! Last month, they said I had like 15 movies at $15 each! They said what time they were ordered and I was out shopping and there is no way my kids would order that!Oh, and the mgr. lady thought she had me on hold and I heard her tell somebody that she got another one of those people from Oakland and just what is wrong with people from Oakland, Stockton, and Fresno that they don't pay their bills and want a free hand out! I called my people at NAACP and filed a complaint! Have a blessed day!"
"Linda of Niles Michigan, MI",7/2/2012,,"Eight months ago, I was dissatisfied with the internet service I had before. So I went searching for internet through Comcast as I already had my cable TV through them. I spoke with a woman and told her I was looking for a better deal for internet service, and asked what she could do for me. She told me about different plans. One was what is called Econo Internet Service, it sounded very reasonable. The installation would be spread out over 4 months on my bill. Then there after my payment would be $26.99 + $7.00 for the box rental total $33.99 a month. This month our bill came from Comcast and my husband was furious as our total bill with cable was $123.63. My husband has been out of work since January of this year. So we started to go over our cable bill and realized that for the last 3 months the internet was $36.95 and $35.30. So my husband called Comcast to talk about the problem with the price of the internet. Not only was it wrong, but the math for the internet part of billing was wrong. They informed my husband that that internet service we got from them was a promotional, which is an outright lie because I was the one (Linda **) who spoke with the representative for Comcast when I got the internet. And she informed me that she has this particular plan Econo Internet Service and was really pleased with it. At no time during our conversation discussing the price after installation was paid off that this was a promotional fee. And that it would have gone up. If she had, I would have declined to get it and searched elsewhere for a better deal. Because of my husband being unemployed at this time, money is almost non-existent and every penny counts. And one thing we have to have is the internet for him to search for work and keep applying every week for his unemployment benefits. So instead of canceling the internet for the time being, we had to change our cable TV programs to accommodate for the unfair practice in extorting more money from the consumers. Now I understand why Comcast is rated one of the ten worst companies. They deserve the title. But mark my word. As soon as my husband is employed again, I will kiss Comcast internet goodbye. I almost forgot they told my husband that this promotional was for 6 months. I am livid for them lying like that."
"Wanda of Herndon, VA",7/2/2012,,"On June 11, 2012, I called Comcast customer service to move cable account from 14A to 16B. The address is the same, only the room changed. The customer representative created a new account with all the information above and scheduled a technician to come out on June 13, 2012, between the hours of 10 - 12. As of June 13, 2012, the cable appears to be working fine.On June 13-22, 2012, every morning, the television screen has no picture. The following message displays on television â€˜this explorer box is not authorizedâ€™ and the telephone number. Each morning one of the nursing facility employees calls Comcast on behalf of **, which I am very grateful that they take the time to do this. The television picture will display, after the customer service representative resend the signal to the cable box.June 17, 2012, I called Comcast starting at 11:00. The customer service representative was able to resend the signal to the cable box. The television picture displays. This is a reoccurring problem that needs to be address and not by the customer service representative resending the signal to the cable box every day. I called Comcast at 2:00 to try and figure out the problem and schedule a technician to come out and check the problem. First spoke to John who stated that he could not talk to me because I was not an authorized user. I tried to explain the above to him with no luck. I asked to speak to a supervisor. I believe I was intentionally disconnected. When I called back, John called me back. Antonio, floor team lead (Employee Number - **) was also no help. I have talked to many very helpful customer service representatives for the last two years on the behalf of my father **, who has dementia. John and Antonio basically did not appear to want to do their job, help or provide suggestions that may have resolved this problem. Solutions, that is what customer service is about I believe.On June 17, 2012, I called Comcast sales department. The young lady was very helpful and verified that my name displays as an authorized user on the account. I asked her if she could please document that in the file and she did. She transferred me to customer service representative who was very helpful. He checked the cable signal and resent the signal to the cable box. He transferred me to billing and the young lady was also very helpful. She said she would credit the account for two days. I was transferred back to customer service to schedule a service appointment. Funny, I am back to where I started over 1 hour ago, but this time Claudia, in Largo MD, Report and Repair Unit was very helpfully, knowledgeable and understanding of what I was trying to accomplish. She mentioned that my name was all over the account as an authorized user. She was able to schedule a service appointment for June 20, 2012, between 10-12.June 17-22, every day the message is This Explorer Box is not authorized and the telephone number continue to display and have to call to get service. On June 22, 2012, the cable box was taken to the Comcast office and switched out just to verify that the box was not the issue. The young lady at the Comcast office was very helpful with suggestions and did credit the account. The new box was activated and the problem remained. I called and spoke to another very helpful gentleman. I explained that this problem had been going on for over two weeks. He said he was going to try and find a spreadsheet with older codes that usually work. He entered the code and the picture displayed. The true test was when the cable was on the next day and the message This Explorer Box is not authorized and the telephone number did not display. When the cable box was switched out by ** family and the correct code was entered, the issue appears to be resolved.John and Antonio could learn a few lessons from Claudia, Sharon and the other customer service representative who did try to help and succeeded. Customers should not have to call numerous times to get a problem address and/or fixed. Over two weeks to fix an issue is unsatisfactory. Your reply to this letter would greatly be appreciated."
"Karen  of Nashville, TN",7/2/2012,,"Upon services provided on 6/7/12, tech arrived very late. He hooked up my service but had to call 4 days later because I could not receive all channels. At this time, $20 was taken off my bill because he was late. A second tech came out and was also late. He replaced the line going to the receivers. All lines worked for about 10 days only. Another $20 was credited to my account. On 6/30/12 another tech came out who was also late. An additional $20 was credited to my account. At this visit the lines were replaced from the house to the pole on the street. At this time, services are working properly thanks to tech #**. I am requesting 1 month credit on my bill due to the fact that I did not have full services available."
"Jolie of Lompoc, CA",7/2/2012,,"My son turned on the TV today to find the cable had been turned off, with Comcast's 866 number flashing on the screen. I called the number, put in all my info in the automated system, was transferred to someone who asked again for my contact, account, etc. info. She said my cable had been turned off due to non-payment. I asked to speak to a manager. ""Shane"" said there wasn't a reason to speak to a manger, that I need to pay all fees due immediately, plus re-activation fees to have service. What? I became enraged.I have had Comcast for almost 4 years, consistently, without service interruption. My bill is only $50 total/a month. I was asked to pay $157. ""Shane"" put me on hold because I was yelling, and never came back. Again, I called the flashing phone number and put in all my info into the automated system. ""Shalala"" answered and once again asked for my account info. I asked her if she had the info I had already put in through the automated system, she said all she had was my name and phone number... What? I was so angry! Why are we required to put in out info if the CS reps do not even have access to it? Is Comcast trying to make their customers mad even before a rep gets on the phone? Again, ""Shelala"" put me on hold and never came back.For the third time, I called back, but called the 800-Comcast number. ""Delvinia"" picked up and I explained that I was an irate customer after going through the automated system many times to be put on hold and forgotten. She asked me if I had my bill, which I did, dated June 25, 2012. She told me my service had been turned off due to non-payment. Really? I asked for clarification because the bill dated for 6/25/12 had just arrived at my house yesterday, with no indication that it was past due. She told me to read the entire front page, which I did, out loud to her, again with no notice of anything being past due. It has only been 3 weeks since I paid my last bill. She said there is a new ""policy"" that if there is anything outstanding over 65 days that service is disconnected. What? I pay my bill each month, what is owed. Delvinia could not make me understand what she was talking about. I was screaming that this is ridiculous and she started telling me that she could not believe I was yelling while my children where in the house, that if I had such and such amount of money for the month there was no reason that I could not pay the entire amount due, and, once again that she was a 'manager' so no one else would tell me a different story. I could not believe she would tell me how to behave, how to pay my bills, etc. without even knowing my situation. Who are these CS reps?I finally paid the bill, and have now combed the entire bill, searching for something, anything, stating my service would be or was getting disconnected 6 days after the bill was printed! I cannot find anything anywhere. I have been unable to contact anyone who can help me.Two years ago, I had overcharges (which I eventually paid to prevent disconnection) and filed a complaint with the BBB. I received a few follow up emails, but the person who was handling my case is gone, and no one was given my case for the overcharges. I feel lost about what to do about Comcast. They are taking advantage of people, and making things up as they go. I feel totally violated by my horrible experience from today. If anyone knows of a way to make a difference with this company, please post."
"Meghan of Fruitland, MD",7/3/2012,,"I have a hard time even giving Comcast one star. Over 11 hours on the phone with support over a week's time. Lies, promises unkept, service that still doesn't work. Useless. The worst company ever!"
"Gerard of Traverse City , MI",7/4/2012,,"Comcast treating customers like garbage - I called to cancel my Comcast services because I was moving. The woman I spoke with was very helpful and helped me cancel my services and said that I had overpaid and asked for my forwarding address so that she could send me a check. A few weeks later, I received a letter from a collection service saying that I hadn't paid my last bill. This hurts my credit score and greatly upset me. I called Comcast and the woman told me that the balance in my account was zero. She then transferred me to another person who informed me that I had canceled my account before I had paid my bill and that resulted in me owing money. But they couldn't take the time to call and let me know this information before they sent a collection agency after me! I hate Comcast!"
"Karla  of Swartz Creek, MI",7/6/2012,,"In April of 2012, my father had Comcast come out and repair his cable connection. Comcast changed our damaged cable for new. The new cable is laying on his yard still in July of 2012. Comcast has been contacted a dozen times; even the neighbors have told Comcast. I spoke to a rep from their Ann Arbor location, Michael, on the phone on June 13, 2012. I am on the account. I was assured the cable would be buried. It is stressful for my elderly father; not to mention, the lawn service company is now refusing to mow because they have to deal with the cable! "
"Wanda of TAllahassee, FL",7/6/2012,,"My experience with Comcast Cable & Xfininty has been a nightmare. Their billing system and customer service is the worst I have ever experienced. I have to call them every month to verify that I am paying for the correct services that I receive. They enrolled me in the Xfinity Signature Support services without my knowledge in which is another monthly fee. For several months, I have been charged a monthly bundle package fee (which I did sign up for) plus the same services such as phone and internet on the same bill. My bill was so messed up last month that it took several hours for the the representative to straighten it out. I just spent an hour on the phone trying to cancel the Xfinity Signature Support service that they put me in without my knowledge. They gave us a wireless modem and we began using it and they did not inform us that there is an installation fee of $150 and a monthly charge for this service. I am so mad at them for everything they have taken me through, that every time I have to call them, I have a bad attitude and disposition. I wish someone would disband this company and make them pay their customers back for emotional stress."
"Joan of St. Charles, IL",7/8/2012,,"Comcast frequently installs service to units in our townhousesâ€™ community. Since the cable boxes are located at the front between buildings, Comcast runs the cable from the box around to the back and across as many yards/or patios as needed to hook up to the appropriate unit, leaving exposed cable for someone to trip over. These cables are a safety hazard; they are not flagged nor are the other units in the building notified that new cables have been laid exposed in the grass. It frequently takes Comcast months to return to bury the cables. My grandson several years back flipped when his foot caught in the cable. He was a child and not hurt. An adult, especially a senior could be seriously hurt. I have called Comcast and they tell me there is nothing they will do. As an association board member many times over the last ten years, we have contacted Comcast to no avail. The exposed cables create a safety hazard even though most city codes do not permit exposed extension cords in a business or outdoor venue because of a trip hazard. As often as people change media service, this has become quite the troubling issue."
"Ellen  of Mableton, GA",7/9/2012,,"To make a very long, agonizing story short, I've had Comcast about 5 years. Over the past 2 weeks, I've received the worst customer service I've ever had from any company anywhere. The trouble started 2 weeks ago when our main DVR box went out. After several missed and re-scheduled appointments, I started to wonder. I pay $250-plus a month for their service, which, first of all, is nothing special. In 2 weeks, they have failed to show up for 4 appointments. When I missed their ""conformation"" call this afternoon after not getting to the phone in time to answer the techâ€™s two-ring-and-then-hang-up call, I called back in and she said, â€œYes, since you didn't answer, we need to reschedule your appointment for next Wednesday.â€ I was like, â€œUhm, no.â€ So, anyways, I talked to many reps and all were happy to please me while on the phone and then we never heard back from anyone. I'm forced into a contract with them because AT&T does not offer U-verse in our area yet. So if we want cable or internet, they're the only carrier in my area. As soon as it's available, I plan to cancel them very quickly! It's appalling. I'm literally sick to my stomach. After dozens of calls, our service is still out! Just be careful, new customers! They have very appealing new offers. But prices soon go up and the customer service is absolutely awful! I am very upset with Comcast!"
"Christine of Roseville, CA",7/10/2012,,"In February, after 6 months of our ""bundle"" bill going up each month, we called Comcast. The bill had reached $182 a month! My husband took great notes on everything. They offered us $139 a month for the first year and $159 the second year. We asked for a contract but they said they don't do that. Since then, each month, the bill has gone up. This month we reached $152. My husband called them and spoke with a supervisor who said they didn't care about our business and there was nothing he could do. He could not explain the extra charges. My husband asked how they could change the contract and he wouldn't answer the question. My husband then did a computer chat with customer service and felt much better. The man said there was a mistake and we would receive a call within 24-48 hours to correct it. That was four days ago and we have not received a call."
"Marc of Wheaton, IL",7/12/2012,,"I went to bed around 11:30 pm on Monday, June 25. I was up late watching TV. TV and internet services installed by Comcast this past May were up and running fine. On the 26th, we had no service. I contacted Comcast. The CSR I spoke with made me pull all the cables out of my entertainment unit and troubleshoot. It was determined that a technician was to come to our home and the nearest date available was on June 30th to evaluate the outage.Comcast called the morning of the 29th, later that afternoon, sent an appointment confirmation email, and called the morning of the 30th to confirm my 3-5 pm appointment window. At 3 pm, I was outside, playing with my daughter as we awaited the arrival of the tech. My cell phone was inside, charging. At 3:18 pm, Comcast called, yet again, to confirm my appointment. I was outside waiting for the tech and did not hear the phone ring. They cancelled my appointment. I called, furious, as we put aside time on a Saturday and missed a family party so that we could get this taken care of. The next available appointment was on Tuesday, July 3.On Sunday, July 1, my area experienced a severe storm and power was knocked out for several days. Upon the technician's arrival on the 3rd, after the same amount of confirmation calls and the email, we were told that he could not inspect our home because of the power outage. Later that day, a worker for Commonwealth Edison, the local power utility, knocked on our door. He asked if we had Comcast service in our home. My wife said we did and he said that the connection on the pole was fried and that he would contact Comcast directly. I called Comcast again and told them this. The promised they would have a line technician out to the house to look at the issue on Saturday. We were home all day that Saturday, July 7th and no one from Comcast came. The next appointment we were given was Tuesday 10th between 1-3.On the 9th, Comcast called to confirm twice, and again I confirmed the appointment. I also received an email. This was the two-week anniversary of the original outage. We wanted nothing more than service restored, so my wife cleared her afternoon and was at home. I was at work. I confirmed the appointment call earlier that morning. However at 1 pm, Comcast called while I was riding up in an elevator and I did not have cell service, so they cancelled our appointment again. My wife contacted Comcast. They called dispatch and not too much later, a Comcast truck pulled up in front of our house and then a few minutes later, drove off, no call, no knock on the door, no nothing.The evening of July 10, I called and asked for a supervisor. He gave me a new escalated ticket number and said that he would have a line technician come to the house on July 11. No one ever came. The evening of July 11, I contacted Comcast again. I waited on hold for 40 minutes. The CSR finally answered and she told me I needed to talk to technical support, so she transferred me, so I could wait another 40 minutes on hold. Finally, I talked to someone who transferred me to the escalated ticket department. He claims that he will contact me directly today about having a line technician come to my home today. Nothing yet. A regular technician is scheduled to come on Saturday the 14th but all he will do is tell me a line technician needs to repair the connection like I've been telling them for over a week.Today is July 12. I have set aside six hours of time, awaiting a Comcast technician to show up and they have not. I have been told twice that a line technician was going to come to my house; they have not. I've been hung up on or disconnected, routed back through and put on hold for extended lengths of time. I've been told by a utility expert that my connection is fried on the utility pole. I've told this same story to countless individuals that work for Comcast. I have been without internet or TV for over 2 weeks. I've been offered a $25 credit for my inconvenience. I was told by the CSR on July 10 that she guarantees restored service by this Saturday, the 14th. I'm not optimistic, considering that conversation was for not b/c the CSR I spoke with 24 hours later had no notes on my account regarding the conversation I had previously about the arrival of a line technician yesterday.If I treated a customer of mine like this, I would be fired. If I ignored two dozen complaints from a customer over the course of 16 days, I would be fired. Unfortunately, there is really one choice for ISP service in my town, and that's Comcast. If there was any better option, I would've fired Comcast 14 days ago and would not be writing this complaint now."
"Connie of Seattle, WA",7/12/2012,,"When installing someone else's lines down the street, Comcast completely cut our lines at my business (telephone, credit card and internet!) for almost three hours in the middle of our business day! We could not take credit cards, use the phone or use the internet during that time. We lost customers who came in and only had credit cards to pay with (we couldn't serve them because we couldn't process their credit cards!).I've been calling and emailing back and forth with George ** since May 5th. He's been promising to help me get a refund for lost sales on that day but nothing has transpired. I'm going to stop my account with them, but they owe us for lost sales and service interruption for those hours! I have copies of the service work order which initially gave the go ahead for them to do the work in the middle of the day (George ** told me it's typically done in the middle of the night so nobody's service is cut). I have copies of all emails between George ** and myself. He has quit returning calls and emails."
"James of Jacksonville , fl",7/13/2012,,"On April 25th, I was charged for two cable modems and two separate internet services. I contacted customer service on May 5th. The representative told me the problem would fix itself. Two weeks later, the issue wasn't resolved. I contacted customer service again and was told by the representative that he put the credit on my account. I logged on a few days later to discover that it was not applied. I contacted customer service and was told the credit was already applied, so I checked my records against Comcast and found that the credit was not applied. I contacted customer service a fourth time to be told that the credit would be put on the account. I told the rep that I keep getting the same response and it never gets done, so I would like to speak with a supervisor. I was placed on hold for 12 minutes. Afterwards, the rep said no supervisor was available. I told her to find one. The counter went to 55 minutes on my cell phone before I got a supervisor (I had to explain to her that if her supervisor was not available, then get the general manager. If they aren't available, then get the operations manager). In total, the call lasted 1 hour 7 minutes and 36 seconds, only to be told by the supervisor that they would put the credit on next month's bill. I am cutting my losses, paying my account down to a 0 balance and getting a different ISP. This was a $130 lesson learned."
"P of Harrisonburg, VA",7/13/2012,,"The digital box that I had had for years failed, so I took it in to exchange it for a new box. I waited in a long line at the Comcast office, got a new box, and then brought it home. I set it up as instructed and the box could not connect with the service. After four hours with customer service (phone and live chat), the problem could not be fixed and they suggested exchanging the box. I did so the next day. Same issue. I spent two more hours with tech support and they could not resolve the issue. They kept asking if I plugged it in. Why do they insult the customer like that? So, in a live chat, the customer service rep said that a technician would come to the house to fix it. I have now invested 6 hours and 2 visits to the local Comcast office for something that should be simple. Why a box they hand me does not work is puzzling, but shouldn't it be Comcast's problem, not mine?"
"Chris of Middleburg, FL",7/14/2012,,"I have had 4 big issues with only one of them being resolved in the past month.Issue one was I was only getting the 16 meg internet service for the first three weeks when I had ordered and was paying for the 30 meg internet service. I now have the 30 meg after finally getting a tech to help me with my issue; but when transferred over to billing account services to get a rebate on overpaying, they either hung up or got disconnected in the middle of them talking to their manager and never called back.Second issue is my DVR has not been working properly. It won't record most of my shows and the ones that do record skip and freeze. The live TV reply is not smooth and also skips. I called in about this and they scheduled someone to come out and bring me a new DVR and we discussed combining my internet and TV into a double play to get more channel and lower my bill. I said cool, why not? And so the tech would come out with the DVR and upgraded service. When the tech showed up today, Saturday morning, he didnâ€™t have a DVR and instead was trying to install phone service which I never ordered.Third issue is I tried to check my bill a couple days after talking to a rep about the DVR and double play and found I could not get into my account because of an FCC PIN regulation. I called Comcast and come to find out that someone (hopefully mistakenly) added triple play onto my account and I immediately requested it be taken off. They said it was taken care of and that I should give it a couple of days to let the account update. A week later, I tried to get onto my account to view my bill and I still can't so I did the chat option and explained the whole thing over again and the chat rep told me she had taken care of it and to give it a couple of days. Fast forward to yesterday when I get a voicemail from Comcast saying the Comcast tech will be out tomorrow for the appointment. I try to get back on my account to verify that triple play was not on there and view my bill. I still can't get on because of the FCC phone pin. Something is not right at all. I called in and the rep confirmed to me that the triple play was removed and no longer on my account and she has to transfer me over to tech support to fix my online account FCC PIN issue. I get disconnected once again with no call back. I was busy and figured I would have to once again call back tomorrow. Tomorrow came and the tech came out with no DVR and trying to put a phone in my house. I am beside myself because I had called so many times and nobody is talking to each other. I called in after the techs went away and the rep on the phone told me that triple play is still on my account. I am pulling my hair out. I asked the rep what about the two other reps and not to mention the online chat rep who told me triple play was no longer on my account. I said did they just lie to me and the rep said, ""It appears so because it's still on your account."" The rep tried to take it off but told me she can't because the techs had confirmed doing the work to install triple play. So, the rep went to talk to her manager because she thought the techs/contractors are trying to defraud Comcast. She ensured me she would call me back when she could figure out how to get this resolved. No call back yet. I have only been with Comcast for 6 weeks and I have had enough issues with this company to last me a decade. Three reps have flat out lied to me. The account services had screwed up my internet and tried adding a phone service I didn't want. Dealing with this cable company is a full time job so unless you're on unemployment and at home every day, I wouldn't touch them."
"Jennifer of Cooper City, FL",7/15/2012,,"I called Comcast and went over my bill with an associate. She explained to me how she could help me lower my bill. I thought wow, that's great! She explained everything to me, etc. Everything was all set. Later that same day, I went online to make my payment and it told me, ""We're sorry, only the primary account owner can add or upgrade services. You are listed as a secondary user on this Comcast account, and are not eligible to make any account changes."" What? I logged out and logged back in, but I got the same message.I called Comcast and spoke to someone who did not speak English very well. I could not understand her; she said she was in Puerto Rico. I asked her to transfer me to someone who speaks English. Well, she tried to transfer me and hung up on me instead. When I called back, I had to go through the automated system again, was on hold, and finally got to someone. She spoke English, but she said that she could not help and she had to transfer me to tech support. I was on hold again, when finally, tech support answered. However, she could not help me. She said, ""I don't know why they transferred you to me. I can't do anything,"" and then she followed it up with, ""The associate you spoke with must not know what she was doing."" So the tech support transfers me back to customer service (by they way, as I'm typing this, I'm still on hold). My phone has a timer on it so 1 hour and 35 minutes is the correct time of being on hold. I explained the story to customer service. Mind you, all I want to do is pay my bill, give them money for the service they provide me.I asked the customer service rep if there is a discount she can give me and she said no. She said that she already waived the $5.99 fee from the automated payment on the phone. Well, I cannot pay my bill that way either. Their system is telling me my phone number is invalid and I cannot pay my bill online. Why would she not waive the automated system? It's not my fault that I can't pay my bill. All I wanted was some type of compensation or apology for the runaround. At this point, I'm waiting to speak to a manager and have now been on hold for 1 hour and 11 minutes. What's next?"
"Allacen of Little Egg Harbor, NJ",7/16/2012,,"I have had a continual problem with Comcast and their billing. They even disconnected me after I had sent them 4 letters detailing the complaint and asking them to correct the error! They have ignored all my written communications! Basically, in the January/February 2012 billing cycle, my ""special"" pricing expired and the price skyrocketed. I called to cancel, but a rep told me she would give me another price reduction if I stayed. I agreed. Prior to this, we disconnected our TV and phone service due to billing problems, so we only have Comcast for internet services. Funny that we have the same bill every month for DirecTV and Vonage, just like they told us never have to pay ahead or have really confusing amounts! The operator assured me she would make the cost reduction retroactive to cover our February bill. The problem is that my billing cycle runs from the 10th to the 9th of each month, but their billing runs from the 30th of each month so I either have to pay before it is due or have a bill that reflects 2 months' billing. Therefore, when she credited me in February, it still left the March bill at the higher rate, which they carried over then added the new rate despite my written letters and despite me paying the amount I was supposed to pay every month ($46.99 plus tax) with a written cover letter stating ""This pays our account ** in full"" with appropriate dates that the payment covered. I even wrote on the check ""Account ** paid in full,"" again with the dates the payment covered on both the front and the back of the check and which Comcast cashed. They still kept billing me more and more from February to June. Then again, despite four written letters detailing the problem, they disconnected me. I called immediately and spoke to a supervisor who told me to pay $41.00 and that she would credit me so my account would be at zero after my payment. I told her this pays me in full from May 10th through June 9th, correct? She said yes. I reiterated it again and again, she said yes. So I paid the $41, then got a bill for $109.25! When I called today, the rep was very rude and could not help and said ""You only paid $41 last time, that doesn't even cover your bill."" That was what the supervisor told me to pay to bring my account to zero. They told me there were no notes from any supervisor on my account! This is unbelievable!"
"Regina of Orange Park, FL",7/16/2012,,"Every time I have to contact Comcast my service provider in my area, I get all worked up anticipating the worst service. 99% of the time it is true. What happened: Last night, Sunday, July 15, 2012, at 11:58PM we lost service to some stations. DIS, USA, DDC, TLC, Nick, TVLAND, AMC, Food, Life VH1, BET, MTV, A&E Toom to mention a few. Mind you other stations were available. Before I called, I made sure all the televisions (5) were experiencing the same symptom, did the normal symptom checks and noted the error message coming off of one of the televisions. I called Comcast on my home phone who said it would be a 10 minute wait before I would reach a warm voice. Well, I waited for 20 and have phone records to prove it all. After waiting, I get the outsourced group who you can barely understand.I told him about what we were experiencing as noted in the above paragraphs and he made an appointment for a technician to come to the house on Wednesday, July 18, between the hours of 8 and 10am. I told him that interruption of service for that length of time would be unacceptable and wanted to speak to a manager. He put me on hold and never returned back to me. I called back on my cell. An automated message stated I had an appointment as mentioned in the above paragraph which I did not agree on. That infuriated me that they can assume what a customer wants. When I finally got someone, I hung up the home phone and had to explain once again the whole story which infuriated me even more. I got nowhere and at 2am, I went to sleep. I woke up at 4am to check if service was returned and it was not. At 9am service was restored. I don't know the cause of the interruption but it would have been nice if Comcast personnel were knowledgeable to speak to their loyal customers intelligently.Changes I would like to see with Comcast: First, having to stay on the phone waiting for someone to answer and you get the outsourced customer service when you are calling after hours is unacceptable. They are millions of miles away as far as I am concerned to the problem at hand and assume, making an ** out of â€œUâ€ and â€œMeâ€. They really do not get the root of the matter. All they do is go to a manual and script out a process hoping it will alleviate the problem. Second, if Comcast is going to upgrade or do maintenance, it would be a courtesy to their loyal customers to let them know ahead of time so the loyal customers can expect momentary interruption. What happened to customer service? Third, don't offer a three month offer of HBO or Showtime to bribe the loyal customer (what an insult). All we want is good service all the time 24/7."
"Christina of Elizabethtown, PA",7/17/2012,,"I have an account in PA and temporarily moved to western MA. I needed to keep my account in PA and needed only internet service in MA. I have had nothing but problems with them in MA from the beginning in setting up to the end closing. First, they transferred all my email addresses from the PA account to the MA account. To solve that, they made new accounts for me on the PA account but never called me back to tell me what my username and passwords were. This, I was not happy about because the username on that account had access to XFINITY TV and since my MA account was only internet, that meant I was not able to access XFINITY TV. Then, the service wasn't turned on after the account set up for days until I called them about it. Whenever I have trouble with the account, because my billing address is in PA, the call is taken to the PA office instead of the MA office where I need the service because the account information doesn't travel state lines. But after going through numerous people in PA, I finally got transferred to the Boston office and have to start all over again. Only this time, I stayed on the line only to either get hung up on or told by a recording that the call didn't go through and to call the number again. This did not happen only once but every single time. After canceling the service (and finding out not one, but three email accounts were transferred from PA to MA) on the third, I got a statement for the next billing cycle. The billing date is on the eighth. Shouldn't the computer have caught that? I called Comcast, went through three people before they told me that I needed to talk to Boston. I got transferred and after holding for twenty minutes, a recording came on to tell me to try the number again. Going through the motions again, I finally got someone that told me that I have a credit on the account and that I am billed a month in advanced. That is why I received the bill. So why is the computer system not keeping up with cancellations? I do not recommend having two accounts in two states with Comcast. If I could, I wouldn't use Comcast for my PA account but they have the monopoly. I am completely angry and dissatisfied in dealing with Comcast on a state level. Besides the above, I thought I could make a payment at any office. It turns out I can't pay my PA bill in MA. I had put the bill in the payment slot but the people there didn't bother to tell me that I couldn't pay the bill there. They sent it to wherever, it ended up being late. I didn't find out about it until the next billing cycle."
"Kelly of Danville, VA",7/18/2012,,"I have been a Comcast customer for 30 years. The account was in my husband's name and after he died in June of 2009, I continued to pay until I moved out of Comcast's service area. I was told I was owed $341.66 in December of last year. I returned all equipment, submitted my husband's death certificate, and an affidavit of a small estate with me as my spouse's sole heir. I signed the checks for 30 years and submitted payments after his death in my name only. I went to the local office 8 times during my lunch hour. They do not have a telephone number but one representative gave me her business card with a handwritten number to call her. When called, it was the fire department. I have spoken with too many 1-800-representatives to count. During each correspondence, I requested the refund in my name. I received a check for the correct amount on June 24 - in my husband's name. I was told today that ""the law"" prevents Comcast from issuing the check in my name. I have also filed a complaint with BBB and received a call from a young man that asked me, ""so what is your problem?"" I asked him if he had read the complaint - he had not. He told me I should set up an estate for husband. Someone told me today that the state treasurer could cash my check. This is just shameful and I hope and pray these folks never have to deal with such foolishness after the death of a loved one."
"Joanne of Delran, NJ",7/22/2012,,"I have been complaining about poor internet and cable TV service since 10-11-2011. I have called repeatedly with the same complaints, had repairmen out, begged for refunds, been told I would be contacted and never contacted. I explained that I am expected to work remotely from my job and that my computer generally boots me off within the 1st hour and then repeatedly, and that I only have less than half of the TV channels that I am paying for, and more often these few channels with tile during the viewing. If I don't pay my advance payment of $145 every month, Comcast will ruin my credit, so I make my payments. I have no other options as my complex does not allow for dishes. I am entitled to an enormous credit as well as these problems to be resolved.  It's been over nine months."
"Curtina of Decatur, GA",7/24/2012,,"I called Comcast at the end of April to let them know I was moving and needed to transfer my service. Once I got to the new address, I had to keep calling Comcast because no one came out as promised! When someone finally came out, he did something with the cable box in the living room and went outside and did something with the pole. Since then, only one of the three cable boxes actually works! And now, every time I call, I'm told that I will be charged $60 for someone to come out again and activate the outlets! Even though I already paid back when I first called them out! So, I had an appointment for yesterday, July 23rd, and no one ever called or came out! At this point I'm sick of Comcast! I pay entirely too much money for that cable, which doesn't always work properly, for this type of treatment! I am not being treated like a real customer. This company is just taking my money for nothing in return and this is the last straw."
"Umar of Bay Shore, NY",7/24/2012,,Comcast has a habit of making billing errors and then having people call back to get refunds. Their billing methods and services are horrible. Their cable offerings are also the worst.
"Rebecca of Aurora, CO",7/25/2012,,"I've been having trouble with my Comcast internet service for several months, and I've called them repeatedly. My supposed high-speed internet service is slower than dial-up. Websites are constantly freezing and crashing my computer, and I couldn't stream a video without it freezing up for 10-15 minutes several times during a 40-minute show. Comcast said it was my fault, and they told me just reset my modem. When it got to the point where I was resetting my modem 20-30 times a day and I was still getting only intermittent, very slow connections, I called yet again. I was told to take my old modem in and get a new one. When I plugged in the brand new modem, it not only took out my internet connection, it killed my phone service. I had to take several trips back and forth to a pay phone begging them to do something. I had to wait until the next week before they'd send someone out. I waited all day and they never bothered to show up. I found out later, after another trip out to a pay phone, that they had called me and when I didn't answer my non-working phone, they decided to blow me off. So, they refused to come out and fix my non-functional phone service because my phone service doesn't work. It's unbelievable that anyone can be that stupid! I finally got someone to come out and replace the modem, and now I'm back to where I started. I have phone service back, but my connection is extremely slow to non-existent. Websites constantly freeze and crash, and I don't have enough connection speed to stream a video. They have been screwing me around for months, and they haven't done a freaking thing to fix the problem. All they've done is made it worse. And the customer reps act like it's a big hassle to actually take my call and do their job. They're smug, mouthy, insulting, and they act by turns bored and put upon. I've had it. There's yet another person supposed to come out tomorrow. If he doesn't show or doesn't fix it once and for all, I'm transferring my service to a different company. I've had Comcast for years, but they have really hit the skids. Lousy equipment, lousy service, and lousy attitude. I'm sick of Comcast. They suck."
"jeffery and theresa  of Dickinson , TX",7/25/2012,,"I subscribed to have cable and internet provided by Comcast on 7-17-2012 for self-installation. On 7-19-2012, a technician came out and said that our box outside wasn't working and we needed to have our products installed. We called before he left our home and we had a scheduled time for 7-24-2012 for installation. The customer rep said they will be calling us to confirm our appointment. No one ever called, so we called and spoke to Glen in customer service to make sure our appointment was still on for the day because I took the day off. He stated I was wrong and we had no appointment. I stated we did and I wanted to talk to a supervisor. He stated 4 times that his supervisor was busy and I could not talk to them. So, he ended up connecting us to the local area Comcast and they dropped the call. We had to call back and this time, we got JR in customer service, who did put us to a supervisor Rose. She connected us to our local area again, this time, we talked to Karen and she stated that she was sorry that everything was confused on our order, it said it was cancelled but completed. I said it was not completed, so she took notes and told us she was giving all our information to the emergency techs and they would be calling us in 30 minutes to 2 hours. 4 hours went by and I called back to Comcast customer service. I got Harry and he was very rude, laughing at me 3 times. I stated I wanted to talk to a supervisor and he asked why. I told him he was not taking me seriously. He told me he was and that I was wrong for wanting to talk to a supervisor. I had to tell him over and over that I wanted a supervisor. He finally put me over to Michelle, who was not his supervisor and that she was just another supervisor, but she would help me. I stated to her that I wanted to talk to Harry's supervisor. She also stated Harry's supervisor was busy. I told her I wanted to talk to her supervisor. She reluctantly gave me to Rex, which I am not sure if he was her supervisor. He connected me to Louis from our area, a technician. He was very rude and told us that we ordered self-installation and that for him to come out to our home would cost us $50, but he would cut it to $25. I told him no, that after the way we were treated, we wanted it to be installed for free. He told me over and over again that he would not, I would have to pay $25. I told him we just wanted to return our cable boxes and not have the company's services. He then connected us over to Ben in customer loyalty. I told Ben that we did not want Comcast products, that your company treats their customers very badly and I can not believe how we have been treated. He stated that he could send out boxes, but we would have to get the products to UPS ourselves. I told him this was unsatisfactory, that it was not our fault, it was the customer service that Comcast has. All we wanted was to have our cable box and internet installed and then the phone went dead. I can not believe how Comcast treats its customers, who want good quality products with good customer service. The company misrepresents itself on great customer service. So here we sit with 2 cable boxes and an internet box, and I am going to have to go through this whole process again because Comcast cannot get anything right. It sickens me knowing how little and how rudely Comcast thinks of its customers."
"Sharon of Baltimore, MD",7/25/2012,,"I have been a Comcast customer for 17 years plus. I have nothing good to say about their service within the network. The personnel are okay, but the transmission, horrible. I think class action lawsuit within Baltimore City is overdue. Give me FiOS. I despise Comcastâ€™s arrogance. A class action lawsuit for non-delivery of paid services. I'll sign first."
"Teri of El Paso, TX",7/28/2012,,"I paid for my services in full until July 27, 2012. My next bill was generated on July 14, 2012. No problem. I was moving so my equipment was turned in on July 17, 2012. When I got the final bill, it said I had a credit of $4.23. The difference between the bill generated on the 14th and the one generated on the 21st is amazingly confusing. Even though I had paid through the 27th, by the 21st, my final bill showed I had a previous balance of $171.99. This was how much service from July 28 - August 27, 2012 would have cost me. No problem, except when the credits were issued, instead of being credited the whole $171.99 and then receiving credit for the ten days in July which I had already paid for, my final bill was only broken down into days at daily rate from July 17 - August 27, 2012.Nothing adds up to just dropping what July 28 - August 27 would have cost me ($159.02 because I do owe $12.97 on that bill for pay per view) plus ten days of credit from July 17 - July 27, 2012. The only thing the customer service representative would even try to explain to me was the bills which were right in front of me. I can read. After over 45 minutes of back and forth, she offered to get me to a supervisor but conveniently, this person was unavailable and I am supposed to receive a call back. I never have before, I don't see why I would this time."
"Roslyn of Greenwood, LA",7/30/2012,,"I will take a moment to email, but after what we have been through this past week, this really is a waste of time. We had started two months ago to get a number ported from AT&T because we wanted to keep a business number that the company has used for almost 30 years. There were three attorneys in our office. The Senior Attorney, Mr. George ** was retiring and Mr. Richard ** and Mr. David ** wanted to keep the number. Mr. ** was told this process was completed last Monday, July 23, and we were waiting for Comcast to do their part.To much ado and many telephone calls to Comcast corporate office, Monday and Tuesday came and went with no Comcast assistance. Mr. ** had a vacation planned with family for quite some time and was scheduled to leave the office on Thursday, July 26, returning on August 2nd. Mr. ** had finally been assured by four corporate personnel that on Wednesday, July 25, between 11:00 and 1:00, the telephone and internet would be connected. We didn't see any Comcast technician between that time. Finally at 3:00PM, a third party technician showed up without proper tools and left. He told us he would return first thing the following morning to get this taken care of. We didn't see the technician the following morning, so I called him on the cell number he gave us. I was told that since the number was being ported, he would have to wait ten days. That was the first time this was mentioned to any of us. Earlier, I had mentioned this process had begun two months earlier and we were told the port was completed and Comcast could proceed. I spent the whole day on Thursday speaking to several contacts in your corporate offices to see when this would happen. I did receive a call on Thursday from Richard ** from your corporate offices and was told there would be a technician Friday morning from 9:00-11:00. I did call at 9:15 AM on Friday and spoke to Michelle ** or ** in your corporate office and she told me that there was still time. I actually was trying to get started early to be sure someone would show up. Well, 11:00 came and I finally called Richard ** again to let him know that no one had come out. He started to give me a story about why we didn't see the technician between 9:00 to 11:00 and I had said, ""Look, I really don't want an apology and don't want to hear it."" His manager, Brent or Brett called back and we were told something would be done on Friday. At 3:00PM on a Friday afternoon, when most people leave early for a weekend, the technician showed up. By this time, Mr. ** has left on Thursday for his vacation that I know he has not enjoyed because he has been on his cell phone constantly to check on updates. I did leave the office at 3:30 on Friday because I had already planned to leave early. While I was out of town on Saturday morning, I received a telephone call from Fernando ** to check on the telephone and internet status since he was out of the office on Friday. I told him we had gotten internet started, but not completed, but we really needed our telephones. He called me back 20 minutes later and told me there would be someone at our office at 8:00AM sharp. I told him someone would be there to meet them. I received a telephone call from one of the paralegals in the office at 9:15AM on Monday that the technician had not showed up. Finally at 10:00AM, a Comcast technician showed up. I just spoke with the paralegal and we still are not completed with internet. The technician hasn't even started on the telephones. I tried desperately to locate a telephone number for Brian L. Roberts, which I was told was the CEO, hoping I could get some help. I had left a message on a home number that I was able to locate from my internet at home but of course, no one answers the telephone. I did find a 215-286-8960 and spoke with someone about an hour ago and was told she was going to check into this today and get back with me. I have spoken to Richard ** along with his supervisor numerous times, Fernando ** numerous times, Undrea with your Corporate Escalation, Michelle ** or ** and would have certainly thought speaking with corporate personnel that are supposedly right under the CEO, one would hope would get some satisfaction. Another day is half over. We don't all have internet connections but most importantly, we don't have any phone service. Mr. ** left on vacation on Thursday without any communication with his clients or any new clients. We have had no communication whether it be by telephone or internet all last week from any new clients that would have tried to get in touch with him or Mr. **. I would have to say that this truly has been a nightmare. I would like someone to contact me regarding this matter at your earliest convenience."
"Mario of Toms river, nj",7/31/2012,,"Due to Comcast ignoring an address change, 2 bills went unreceived and unpaid. Comcast stopped all services. The address change was corrected and the bill was paid on 7/25/12. After repeatedly being told that services will be restored today, 7/31/12, I was told they can't figure out why they can't seem to get the services turned back on. I do not live on the premises and was told yesterday someone would be by today to check the outside equipment and I didn't have to be there. Well, no one showed today. When I called, they told me I have a service appointment on 8/3/12 and I had to be there, but I never ever made an appointment! I asked how could they shut me down remotely, yet not know how to turn it on remotely. Mind you, I have elderly sick parents coming home this weekend from a nursing home and most obviously am going to need a phone. Plus, some of their medical equipment is monitored remotely over the web! So now the appointment was changed to Thursday and I need to take time off from work to be there. To add insult to injury, they are still billing for these weeks without service! I've heard nothing but bad reports about Comcast's business ethics and thought well, thatâ€™s a few people. Hell no, most everyone who has an issue meets with their inept business practices, which seems more like a scam than a business. In the end, I as the customer will suffer the inconvenience, traveling expenses and loss of pay from work because Comcast, after all these years, still cannot get their ** together. Their attitude is that we need them, they don't need us. When is the public going to wake up?"
"Christy of Summerfield, FL",3/4/2013,,"I receive WiFi through Comcast only, no cable, and I am going with another as soon as I can and I'm contacting BBB. Long story short, I would love to speak to a supervisor but after at least 10 calls, I still have no service. Three times a tech had an appointment with no show and no call. For the lack of follow up and poor customer service, I will never recommend this company. I am still being billed, still I have no service. To anyone out there thinking of going with them, run Forrest run ... and throw your money out the window!"
"Bekaar of Palo Alto, CA",3/5/2013,,"I switched internet service from AT&T to Comcast. A big mistake. Now, I cannot watch PBS NewsHour videos. Everything else (Netflix, CBS, NBC) works fine but not PBS. Their customer service rep says (on a chat service) that the problem is with the site. This is an old, completely lame excuse that I discovered Comcast was using two years ago with Netflix service until Netflix agreed to pay them a fee for service. It is one thing to block a commercial site, but to block a public service site is horrible. The executives at Comcast should be tarred and feathered."
"Mary-Lou of Voorhees, NJ",3/13/2013,,"We have 2 accounts with Comcast because we have 2 homes. I have a credit balance on account #2 (Margate) of approx. $300.00. The money has been sitting there for a couple of months. Our bill is very low on account #2 because we are not using the house in Margate now. I have called Comcast twice and they refuse to either send me a check or transfer the credit from account #2 to account #1. They said that since account #1 is in my husbandâ€™s name and account #2 is in my name, that cannot transfer the credit. We are both authorized users on both accounts. Comcast will only allow one person's name on the account or we would put both names on the accounts.The problem occurred when I did my online bill pay. I selected the wrong Comcast bill. So, I have all this money sitting in the Margate account, and they refuse to give it to us. It's unbelievable! I actually called twice about this issue. The first person that I spoke to said that they could not do. However, the second person said that she would take care of it but never did."
"Samantha of Chevy Chase, MD",3/14/2013,,"How is it legal that Comcast is allowed to raise my bill by 27% without notifying me and with no improvement in service? Their prices are completely inflated and since they have a monopoly, it pretty much seems they can get away with whatever they want. This is highway robbery. It's actually quite a stupid business model - rather than keeping me as a loyal customer by providing a service at a fair rate, they piss me off and blatantly screw me over with this ridiculousness. Now I'm looking into other options. Everyone I know feels the same way. How do they get away with this?"
"Patrick of Friendswood, TX",3/16/2013,,"I have had Comcast Cable service starting April 2012. From May 2012, I started having issues - tiling, freezing up, distorted sound which froze up the computer. I complained every month for 10 months; techs were with supervisors trying to repair the issue. They did not. On Feb. 08, 2013, techs replaced the cable from outside box to my apartment. I still had the same issue. A week later, Comcast turned off my service, stating I owed $242.36, which I was to have credits, but they did not see it that way. I paid that amount - service was restored. Then approx. a week after that, they, after getting the $242.36 payment, turned my service off permanently as of Feb. 22, 2013. I am on disability. TV is my entertainment. They are a monopoly. They only care about the money - not the customer or service. So what if you have issues? Comcast doesn't care - they only want new customer's money. Why don't we all get together for a class action suit? Yea."
"rubina of Schaumburg, IL",3/18/2013,,"I gave 30 daysâ€™ notice to Comcast to disconnect my services. They harassed me with warnings of sending my name to collections. They demand I give them 60 daysâ€™ notice to disconnect. I paid them over $8,600 in the past 3 years, and these bastards refuse to dc my services."
"Vince of Washington, DC",3/19/2013,,"I contracted Comcast in late 2011. I live in an apartment building in Washington, DC and we were assigned a Comcast rep. I called to speak to him, but he was out of the office. A woman answered the phone and over the course of our conversation, quoted me a number of prices for different services. I asked for the cheapest service that included TV and internet service. She claimed that was the triple play package. When I asked about what kind of modem I would need, she gave me some information and said that I could buy a modem to work with it. I bought a modem and when the technician came to install the service, he said that I would have to use and have to pay a monthly charge for the Comcast modem, contrary to what I was told. When he came to install it, I talked to the tech about this and he said that purchasing a compatible modem is impossible because there is no modem on the market that does what Comcast needs in reference to the service. Therefore, I am obligated to pay a charge that I was told I wouldn't need to pay. When I called the Comcast rep to sort this out, he basically told me that it was tough luck. I would have to pay it even if the Comcast rep had told me I wouldn't have to pay it and that there was nothing I could do. The technician also said that complaining to him wouldn't work because many customers have complained about him that he is unhelpful, rude and ineffective. The tech told me that if I had contracted with the rep himself, the tech wouldn't have had enough information on his installation documentation to get me set up that day because the rep constantly does not complete work, leading to the tech being unable to complete his job the first time. I have no reason to believe that the tech was telling me anything but the truth since it seems that it would be in his best interest not to tell me negative things about his company/coworkers. After some back and forth with the management team at my building, the Comcast rep was replaced. I contacted Comcast to fix the issue of being overcharged/misinformed. The response was that they couldn't give me the price that was originally quoted, but they could comp me my HD box, which was roughly equivalent. Fast forward to the early fall 2012 and I received a letter saying that, by mistake, they had been charging me incorrectly by not charging for the HD box and from then on I would have to pay for this. Along with this, my package, which was supposedly the cheapest that they offer, has now doubled to nearly $170/month. I have called in and spoken to numerous Comcast billing/customer support reps that have vowed to fix the problem by elevating it to the next level and have vowed to call me back to tell me what has happened. I have never received any communication from Comcast. Every time I call in, the rep cannot seem to find out what happened to the report that was filed the previous time and vows that it will be different.I have been back and forth with no resolution. I'm being overcharged monthly for a service package that I didn't order and for an equipment that should be included. The only two explanations that I can see is that someone lied to me or someone is not competent and/or trained enough to do their work. Either way, the fact that I cannot receive any information is systemic of a deeper corporate problem - that Comcast will profit as much as they can using dishonest business practices because the process a customer must go through to fix it is extraordinarily long and convoluted. They just expect people to give up and pay the extra money. Whoever runs this company should be ashamed of themselves and the company. I know not a single person who has had a positive experience with Comcast, but hiding behind a labyrinth of unmanned customer service menus is shameful."
"Michael of Ogden, UT",3/19/2013,,"Comcast decided to change the channel ""tiers"" and what channels were offered to the Blast Plus consumers in my area without warning. The technician I chatted with first told me that I had signed up for a plan that didn't have the channels that I had previously had. She then decided that, actually, the channels disappearing were due to Comcast reevaluating line-ups to ""serve"" customers better. Yes, they were serving me better by cutting out almost half of the channels at the same price! It seems they really have no competition and have the monopoly to put the screws to customers whenever they want. The representative then tried to ""upsell"" me to the channel lineup I had just the day before(!) for more money! It seemed like a classic bait and switch and the technician seemed to not have any argument against that when I told her so. I was just sitting down to watch a basketball game but found that now my channel is gone! Thanks for nothing, Comcast. It's time to write to my ""representatives"". The value just doesn't come close to justifying the price and boy, are they tricky!"
"Karen of Lansing, MI",3/22/2013,,"I signed up for Comcast a year ago and was told my bill would be the same for two years and that I would have Starz and HBO for life at no cost. Wow, a year later, we get a bill that has doubled in price and was told that we were in a one-year deal and that they have no record of the conversation and the guy on the phone never tried to talk us out of leaving them, which we found to be very odd. Needles to say, we decided to cancel our service based on blatantly being lied to by Comcast and went back to AT&T (who we're not fond of either). A couple of days before our install with AT&T, I called Comcast and had them disconnect my service as of March 1 and asked where to bring the equipment to. The AT&T installer told us that the Comcast guys did a horrible wiring job and that they cut the AT&T lines, which they didn't need to do, but routinely do anyway. After the install, we turned in our equipment and now nearly one month later, we get a new monthly bill from Comcast and a past due bill. The bill indicates all HD service was removed on the 1st and nothing else. I'm expecting a refund check and now get something that is going to show up on a credit report. I called and was told that I never called and asked them to disconnect and that they have no records of any phone calls.Of course, they do see that we turned in all of our equipment and can't explain why the HD service was removed. After an hour of bickering with these **, they said they'd fix the error but it would take at least 4 weeks to get a refund making it now 8 weeks to get a refund, a refund we were planning on using for our AT&T bill. I honestly believe that Comcast has a hidden policy that their employees are supposed to stop disconnects at all costs and if they don't get some sort of black dot next to their name and so many black dots will lead to termination. In order to not get black dots next to their names, they just don't record that you called to disconnect but merely called for a reduction in service or to ask general questions. Comcast, you are liars and I hate you."
"Ricardo of Coral Gables, FL",3/22/2013,,"Comcast provides the worst customer service of any company that I have ever dealt with. We have made four service appointments and they have missed each one, a couple after confirming that their representative was on the way. Follow-up with customer service is useless. I was told twice that a supervisor would call back within two hours and several days later, I have still not heard from them. It is time to make Comcast divest of their monopoly or make them pay substantial penalties for the poor service."
"Dan of Canonsburg, PA",3/25/2013,,"I had cancelled my service on the 15th of March. My billing due date was on the 18th. All was fine and dandy. Ten days later, I got a bill saying that I owe double. After spending about a half hour in online chat, they said that I have to call and cancel my service. Instead of stringing me along all that time, tell me flat out that they can't help me and I need to call. So I called; now I can't get through. I was told I have a 13-minute wait. Finally, I got someone. I got the service cancelled back to the 15th (I have receipts for the equipment). They told me that I still owe when my bill wasn't even due yet (?). It was also fun to see them jockey the channels around, taking the most popular channels and moving them to the higher-priced services so you needed to upgrade to get them. I'm trying to figure out why Verizon can offer better services for a heck of a lot less. By the way, I switched to Verizon."
"Debbie of Manchester, NH",3/26/2013,,"I cannot believe that Comcast is forcing us to purchase HD Converter Boxes for $9.99 per month per box in order to continue receiving HD quality TV on our brand new TVs. I do not have the room to place a big box on my kitchen counter, nor do I want to pay an additional $20 per month in order that I may even watch TV on my two new TVs! This is outrageous!"
"Michael of Harwich Port, MA",3/28/2013,,"We were loyal Comcast customers for twenty years. Due to financial incentives, we went with Verizon this month (March 12, 2013). We returned the Comcast box and modem to their service center the next day. Several years ago the router they provided us with failed and Comcast told us we had to get a new one at our expense, which we did. Now they claim they want the defective router returned and we have no idea what happened to it. Verizon provides a modem/router unit and Comcast is trying to charge us $45.00 for the old router. Why didn't they ask before? You think we'll ever be Comcast customers again and that we won't tell others of our experience?"
"Tracy of Jacksonville, FL",3/28/2013,,"My wife was on the phone with Comcast for well over 6 hours today and yesterday, was transferred from one rep to another, cut off twice and forwarded to a voicemail. Really stellar service, guys! I have had Comcast service for many, many years. I have had the same email for that entire time and have used the same modem and router now for the last 2-3 years without service problems. Now, it seems that when I want to move my service to a new address, no one seems to know how to fix it! I am only on now because of my iPhone and the wifi in my new building (which is painfully slow)! My wife and I operate home-based businesses and rely on the internet. I can suffer without the cable TV for a day or two, but cannot be without the net, for which they have already billed me for. We had an expedited service call with a confirmation number to have a tech come to our house today. After no show, we called again and after an hour on the phone was told that someone called and came by, but we were not there. That is simply not true. Phone records support no call and a service tech must check in with our concierge to enter the building which was not done! Poor service and dishonest too! I posted numerous complaints to their Facebook page since their corporate website is useless and this is what I got from them moments ago: ""Tracy, your FB posts have also been shared with the executives at corporate. You can also send your detailed account to the email address you used yesterday (comcast_cares@comcast.com). Just to let you know, we removed the multiple posts with the phone number listed.""So you see, they have decided to remove my posts, rather than fix the problem. Really smooth!"
"L of Us, MI",3/28/2013,,"If internet service wasn't needed, I would have said good riddance to Comcast a long time ago. But since there are very few alternatives, I will remain a hostage of terrible customer service, awful download speeds (that is understandable since I pay for the fastest speeds possible), moronic website and excuses up the gazoo. Did I mention how much I despise Comcast? And too think this is 2013 and we are still living in an industrial infrastructure. Crumbling bridges, roads or should I say potholes that pass for roads? It's time for this country to catch up with the rest of the world so that when the wind blows, we still have internet service."
"Lawrence of Atlanta, GA",3/29/2013,,"Watchathon free HBO was not honored - it's a scam to make you upgrade for 6 months. I had 2 days of HBO. When asked why I received a message about the upgrade for free week I had not received, there was no answer back. I asked to remove Free Watchathon and was told $2.99 would be billed for a service change? Is this a scam to get upgrade deal you did not request? Watch out for a real shady deal!"
"Sherry of Tupelo, MS",4/1/2013,,"My internet service stopped working on March 27. I called the 800 number and spoke to a rep. The rep did some troubleshooting and found that my modem is no longer working. The rep then told me to go to the local office and have the modem exchanged. I specifically asked the rep to make sure the local office would be able to exchange the modem. She said yes, they carry the modem in the office and would be able to exchange it. When I arrived at the local office, I was told they do not carry the modem and therefore could not exchange it. The local rep said she would put in a ticket for a technician to exchange my modem on March 28 after 3:30PM. I waited for the rep, but no one showed. Today, April 1, I called to report the incident and to reschedule a new time for a tech to exchange my modem. The CSR said the only time available is Thursday or Friday this week. I take online classes and this is my only internet service. We have had Comast service for years and think we deserve better service than what we are receiving. I am very disappointed and have been trying to reach a manager. I am getting the runaround from the CSR. I need help now!"
"Michelle of Parker, FL",4/2/2013,,"I would really like to list all of the details of everything that has gone wrong since starting service that has lead to my frustration, but it would be 10 paragraphs long! I went into my local office on 2/28 to get cable and internet. After asking, I was told they didn't currently have any packages or deals at this time. I got basic cable lineup with internet, one digital box, one converter box and modem. I was unable to get the converter box and modem working even after extensive troubleshooting with several reps. I was advised that I would need to be transferred to set up an appointment for a tech visit. I was disconnected during the transfer. The day of the appointment, the tech never arrived even though I was only told to have someone 18+ here to let the tech in. I was informed they cancelled my appointment after attempting to contact me 3 times per their policy, even though I had someone sitting in my living room waiting on them to let the tech in if they had showed up. I was informed the tech would call me by 2PM to let me know when they would arrive. At 3:15 I called back after getting no call, to be told the second ticket was cancelled and marked as resolved. Again, I was told a tech would arrive by the end of business day, only to get a call an hour later to be told it's another tech that has to come out. It would not be that day. I again got disconnected during transfer. No call back. After 5 or 6 calls to them and being disconnected or routed back to the beginning of the prompt, I was told their computer system is down. The next evening, before I could try calling again, I got an automated courtesy call to remind me of my appointment the following morning. I was glad I did not have to call back to make the appointment, but irritated that no one discussed the time frame or called back the previous night to ensure this time would work for me. The tech did not call first, which didn't bother me, but so much for their policy. I ended up having to write an email to their corporate dept and got a call back the next morning. It was obvious she did not read my email as she said she wasn't quite sure how she could help me. She gave me a $50 credit for the days I was unable to use the services. Due to computers being down, she could not upgrade my plan to the HD preferred Triple Play for $99.99 for 12 months (a plan a previous rep tried to up-sell me on that the original rep didn't offer) or reset my online my account password. She stated she would call back on Tuesday to assist me with both of these issues. And if I was charged the $80 tech visit fee, she would waive it. She did not call back. One night my modem wouldn't work, so I called in and was informed I could either go into my local office to switch it out or have a tech come out for a $30 fee. This rep reset my password, but stated only the corporate rep could waive the original tech visit fee. She did change my plan, but now it was $119.99 per month. I read off all terms the previous rep gave me, so she offered to give me two $9.99 credits per month to bring it to $99.99; offered to give me all premium channels for 3 month; waive the $20 install fee and a credit of $30 for tech fee; and stated I could keep the digital box I currently have along with the HD box the tech will bring as part of the plan. But if I wanted to keep converter box, I would be charged $1.99 per month. The tech came out 2 days later and got everything, but stated opposite. That the converter box was part of the plan, but the regular digital box was $9.99 per month. I called the CS rep while he was here to get this straight (and recorded this call). He stated I was correct, but the tech insisted he could not leave the original digital box and that I would have to go to the local office to pick one up. A few days later, I woke up and the cable was out. I called again and the automated prompt said service outage in my area. When it was still not working that night, I called in and no one knew anything about this. They couldn't get my cable working, so I stated they would have to set up another tech visit. Upon my insistence, they said I would not be charged for the visit but I would have to wait until Sunday morning. I went into the local office when I found out they were open until 1PM, Saturday, to exchange the box. I was told they were trying to retire these boxes and said this was not even a HD box, had a dent in it, and should not have been installed. I got cable working again and this time I could see the difference with actually the HD box. I saw a tech outside working on the lines. He said the tech who previously came out was supposed to have done this to improve service, but it wasn't done. He stated with tech visits, they are supposed to call. If you don't answer the door, they wait for 15 minutes then try again. If you still don't answer door or phone, they will have a CS rep make one final call before cancelling the appointment. Everything was fine for a few days until we rearranged our entertainment center and plugged everything back in to get no power on the box. A CS rep said we will have to wait until Tuesday for a tech to come out or go into the office on Monday to get another box. We realized we had not cancelled our previous tech's appointment for Sunday morning, but the rep said there's none showing any appointment for us. I gave the rep the ticket number and she said, ""Hmm.. This ticket was cancelled. It's marked as resolved,"" but couldn't tell me who did it. I said, ""Whatever. I'll wait until Monday morning and go into the local office."" Well a tech happened to be at a neighbor's house on Sunday afternoon and offered to come over and look at our box. He said the wire was bad and replaced it. After a month, I still have not gotten my pin to be able to electronically view my bill. I am not getting any of the premium channels that are part of my plan or the ones offered for the 3 months or know if my tech fees have actually been waived. All I get is attitude and treated like, ""Well I see you're getting these credits every month"" even though that is to make my plan the price it should be every month. It has been one thing after another. I am ready to write a letter to the office of the CEO."
"Malissa of Oakley, CA",4/4/2013,,"I have had endless issues with Comcast since I started using their services. The most recent and most outrageous incident occurred this month. There are many complaints that I have:First, we have complained multiple times that our internet is extremely slow and that we think it may be the modem that Comcast provided to us. They have sent technicians over and they suggested changing our router. So we bought a new router for $80 (the one they recommended) and it didn't change a thing. They refused to admit that it was the modem. Our internet would be down for days at a time! And coincidentally, when we called for a technician to come, it would start working the day before they were scheduled to come. Coincidence? I think not.Recently, our internet was down for 3 days during the time Comcast was changing to faster download speeds. So we called a tech to come out and fix the problem since they were not able to fix the problems over the phone. So the tech said that the modem (the one that Comcast provided to begin with) was not compatible with the new download speeds. What?! So he switched out the modem and tried to leave before the internet was working. So we said, ""Um, excuse me, it's not fixed."" The tech then stated something might be wrong with the router (lame excuse for not following through and completing his job). Our router works just fine; mind you, it's the brand new one we just bought. So we gave it some time to link up with the modem and finally the internet started to work!Now, prepare yourself for this one! The next bill came and there was a $50 additional charge for a tech to come out and swap out their faulty equipment. The customer service agent said that he couldn't do anything but take off $25! This is absurd! Why am I paying for your faulty equipment? This is by far the worst customer service experience I've ever had!In conclusion, Comcast has fraudulently charged me for their own defective equipment and I will be cancelling my service with them and potentially filing a lawsuit and complaint for the grief they have put me through in the past 6 months."
"Lee of Highland, MI",4/5/2013,,"I first became a Comcast customer in September of 2012. From the start, there were billing issues. The installation rep would quote one price, which I was satisfied with. When the bill came, it was much different and much higher than that quoted by the service tech. Billing issues continued for two or three months. In March of 2013, I moved to an address on the same street as where I was previously living. I was quoted a price and no explanation of billing policy was given. I have always been current on my bill and was newly enrolled in a plan that was only $10 per month more than I was paying for internet alone. I was quoted a $50 installation fee and given a $20 credit. I paid that bill. Four days later, I get a bill for $120! After one and a half hour of arguing with customer service, the rep said I need to pay $33 and change which was the pro-rated fee. Why do I still feel as if I am getting screwed? One more issue like this with Comcast and I will be looking elsewhere."
"Kathleen of Kenilworth, IL",4/6/2013,,"We pay about $325/month for internet, cable TV and telephone service from Comcast. Although we live in an older home that previously had cable service, it took over a dozen visits to our home by Comcast at the time of installation to get the service working. We finally hired an outside consultant at our own expense, who installed a booster to get our WiFi service working throughout the house. We have had problems after problems in the five years we have had ""service"" through Comcast. This week, our HD cable box/DVR failed and a technician arrived to say that Comcast was experiencing a ""shortage"" of DVR boxes, and that he would ""try"" to find us one. He left without replacing the broken box or advising us when we would receive a replacement."
"Mary of Belvdere, NJ",4/7/2013,,"I was paying the bundle price of $170 a month and now all of a sudden, I owe them $800 and something. How can this be when I pay my bill every month?"
"Lisa of Tamarac, FL",4/10/2013,,Comcast does not allow us to use the DVR we purchased a couple of years ago because of a new little box they said we had to have in order to continue service with them. The DVR cost around $300 and is not compatible with this little box. They offered no solution and now I can't record shows that I might miss and want to watch later. I would have never purchased a $300 DVR if I knew this was going to happen.
"Lance of Federal Way, WA",4/11/2013,,"I was offered by a Comcast salesman two movie channels and my Xfinity bundled service for $129.99 a month for a year. I was offered a similar deal years past by another salesman going door to door. Both times I was lied to and found out when I got the bill that I was only getting the one movie channel. And to make it even worse, it is for only three months. The new salesman told me that this mistake would not happen again, and here we are. I am feeling as though your door to door sales come with a commission for these salesmen to lie. I am going to talk to neighbors and write blogs to find out if I am the only one lied to, but I think not. When I called customer service, they were of little help. I talked to Mike ** employee number ** and the only thing he could do was let me have one channel for three months. I am sure that there are some legal issues involved if I can just find a few more people in my neighborhood or online that have also been lied to. I have been a long time customer with Comcast and have been tempted many times to go to DirecTV but have not wanted the hassle of change. But this is starting to make me really mad. "
"Judith of Shelton, WA",4/13/2013,,"I received a notice that my cable signal had an issue and I needed to set up appointment to be home when they came to fix. First appointment was for Apr. 3 between 1 and 3 pm. 3:30 I called to ask when I could expect tech and was informed he could not tell me that, just would be sometime today. I cancelled and rescheduled for April 9th between 8am and 10am and requested if possible to be the first appt. Noon came, no phone call, no repairman, no contact to this day. Cable still making little squares in signal. You are spending a lot of effort on TV to convince people to make 2 hr window appointments. What hogwash! Am I ever going to get problem fixed?"
"Mark of New Waterford, OH",4/13/2013,,"I would like everyone to know that the way that Comcast has their channel lineup is to fool you as to what you really get on your TV. The channels like HBO and Starz are showed that they are part of the lineup, but hold on. Now there is a mark like this ""^"" by the HBO HD and Starz HD. So even if you pay for HD and it shows that HBO and Starz are part of the lineup, you still have to pay separate for them. My recommendation is for people to drop Comcast, which is the only cable provider in my area. If you want cable, you pay a new price for something every year. Or they give you something free then in a year or so, send you a hidden message in the bill that says, ""Oh by the way, the free stuff... you now have to pay for"" or you don't get the channels anymore from then on out. They give you channels you have no need for, then charge you more money. The answer to this problem is to drop Comcast as I did and get Dish or DirecTV. Get more things for less money. Comcast stinks!"
"Subrata  of Naperville, IL",4/15/2013,,"I just noticed a $7 charge on my statement for a cable modem. I have had my own modem for the last 2 years and apparently after my last conversation with a Comcast agent last month, I got a charge for using my own modem. When I asked the agent today (April 15, 2013), she removed it and told me, ""It is a mistake and so we are removing it."" Nothing else! There is no guarantee that she would have removed the charge if I did not notice it today. I had to point it to her to remove the charge.I also changed my service on March 22, 2013 and was promised a monthly charge of $138.22. I got my bill today and it's $40 more. When I asked the agent what happened, she told me that she has no record of the $138! It's only that I spoke to an agent on 03/22 showing up on the record. Interestingly, I got no emails from Comcast for my service change on 03/22. Every time, in the past, they send me a note when I change services. This is very poor customer service and highly unreliable. Always check your monthly bills before you pay all those sneaky charges."
"Jill of Albany, OR",4/18/2013,,"Recently, I got an email from Comcast telling me to follow a few simple steps to update their program. I did that. Suddenly, everything dealing with the internet stopped! After trying everything I could think of, I called a computer tech to come out. After looking everything over, he told me he had been dealing with this same problem for days with lots of customers, and that it resulted from people updating their Comcast program as instructed. After trying everything else, we went to Staples to find a new wireless router, where the sales clerk told us she had been getting the same story from people suddenly having to replace their routers! I am furious! This cost me $130. I don't have to spend! I am very tempted to put this on Facebook but thought itâ€™s only fair to discuss it with you first!"
"Dale of Newman, CA",4/20/2013,,"I just found out that Comcast does not supply the battery backup for phone modem but they do not let you know that until you call in and ask where the battery is. I called and asked what if the power goes out. They said that you have to buy the battery for $35. I told them that they should let customers know this because I am disabled and need my phone. I was told, ""Too bad, buy the battery."" The modem they took out and replaced had a battery. I ordered my new modem for the new speed they told me about and needed a new modem so they replaced it. I think that Comcast should notify their customers about this. There are a lot of disabled people out there that need a phone 24 hours a day."
"Helenenue of Richmond, VA",4/24/2013,,"I had an apartment with my kidâ€™s father. He got cable put into the apartment in his name. I was giving him the money for his bill. The cable got cut off, and he moved to another resident getting Comcast at that resident in his name. I was told I am unable to receive any of Comcast services until his debt is paid. I called customer service and I am spoken to rude. I went to Comcast and a young lady told me when I spoke to her they didn't have a supervisor. For 1 day of service, I was charged $162.92."
"None of Morton Grove, IL",4/25/2013,,"Ever since we moved into the 2-flat we are in, our cable has simply not worked. Anytime we try to access the On Demand, we get the same error message for no reason which tells us to call and/or unplug and reset our box. If we do this, it takes 5-6 days for the TV to fill in. We have ""To Be Announced"" on almost every channel and it will fill in literally one hour ahead of where we presently are every two hours. We will have no movie channels. We can't watch anything because it will just say ""To Be Announced"" if we go to a channel where the TV isn't showing the title. I have called at least 70 times over the years and then I gave up. We were told something must be interfering with the signal from our box/apartment to their satellites-tower-whatever (they are about a mile from us). The tower is less than four blocks. We have had seven technicians out here this year alone. Some are beyond stupid. One guy said he'd been working there two weeks. They stand and scroll through the menu stuff, reset the box (again) and if it works, it will work for a week or two, then the same thing happens all over. Over the last two years, they have replaced the wire coming in from outside, sent us a new box (two years ago) and claimed they found various things outside on the pole/building from little tears in the wires to I don't know what. One guy got curious at me when he had to come back that same day to replace the cable from outside into our wall because after 7 hours it wasn't fixed even though he said that would be the next step, I guess for someone else to do. This week, I called starting Wednesday of last week to report that all the TV guide was out again. We had bad storms so I said maybe that was it, and yes, I had unplugged the cables, let it sit an hour, plugged it all back in and it was not helping. I told the guy not to reset the box as we had one day of TV guide filling in (so we could see three hours ahead of us on the guide) and so of course, he reset the box anyway. (I was talking to Mexico.) I said I did not want to be rude but asked if I can get a number or talk to someone in the US who does the tech stuff as I have done this to death. He said no, they had no way to do that. He said he'd schedule an appointment for me which was today, the 25th, over a week since I called. I said that was unacceptable and he said that's all he had. He connected me to billing. I was on hold for seven minutes then got disconnected. At this point, I'd been on the phone for three hours and had things to do so I gave up for the day.The next day, I called again and (got Mexico) asked for a supervisor. The guy said he couldn't give me one unless I told him what was wrong and he decided I needed one. I told him the same story. He listened and then put me on hold for 9 minutes. The supervisor got on. I had to tell him the whole thing again. He said there was nothing they could do, but he would give me an appointment sooner, on Tuesday the 24th between 1 and 3. I said fine. He said he would have one of the technicians call us the next day. (No one called again, third time promised.) I called billing and was told by the girl that they could not issue any credits until the tech came out and fixed things, then they can refund money.So we went without TV for a week. When the appointment came on Wednesday, no one showed up. I called and was told that they hadn't told us we had one for sure. He had just said he would try to get me one earlier. This is total ** as I had the guy on speakerphone and my husband also heard him make this appointment as we talked about who would take off work to be home for it. They said we had the appointment for Thursday from 3-5. So here it is Thursday and not only did I take off work 1/2 day, again, to be here but at 20 minutes to 5, Prince Telecommunications called me to tell me they were Comcast and they were really sorry but the guy was running terrifically late and would be here between 6 and 6:30 probably. I said fine and hung up on her. What are you supposed to do?This has been one week with no TV, but this same issue has gone on the entire 13 years we have lived here. We have tried just to put up with it but my nephews are staying with us and no one can ever watch TV. Yet, Comcast calls us at least once a week soliciting, trying to get us to change to their internet service even though we were told that if we have these much problems with the cable, we probably wouldn't have much luck with internet either. The last time someone came out to fix this, Comcast called us relentlessly asking us to take various phone surveys. I literally called and told them if they didn't stop, I'd file a harassment claim. I had to block two of their numbers, it was so bad. How they get away with this is beyond me. Why they are allowed to is purely politics. How many decades have people been complaining about Comcast? I am also tired of calling and getting 15 minutes of ads and menu options just to talk to a human being who can do something."
"Joydeep of Columbus, IN",4/25/2013,,"I was issued wrong charges for my Comcast bill for May 2013. When I called Comcast billing department on April 23, the initial customer service representative (CSR) could not help and forwarded me to her supervisor. Her supervisor (CSR ID**) gave me the commitment that the issue would be resolved by 3:00PM EST on April 24 and she will call me latest by 3:00PM EST on April 24. No one called. When I called on April 25 (at 11:30AM), the CSR (ID**) told me that someone will contact me later. When I asked for a supervisor, he denied to connect any supervisor. Now I am stuck and at a dead end on this issue. Comcast's local office says that I have to connect with billing department for billing issues. No one from Comcast billing department's side is ready to help in resolving the billing issue. This shows the kind of unprofessional and mismanaged operational procedures followed, and customers are left at the mercy of the situation. The statement that Comcast makes."
"Debra of Kearneysville, WV",4/26/2013,,"I returned a converter box with superficial damage to the plastic cover of the box (it warped from heat in an entertainment center). They did say I would have to pay for the damage, which I am okay with but on my next bill, it showed as ""unreturned equipment"" for $300! If I had known I would be charged for the entire box, I would have just kept it. The receipt I signed distinctly says, ""If any charge is listed above by signing this receipt, I understand the charge will be added to my account and I am legally liable to pay the charge listed above."" There was no charge listed on the receipt! Apparently, they do not know what the word ""If"" means. After two months of dealing with multiple customer service avenues, this has still not been resolved. Lesson learned: When you return any equipment to Comcast, make sure you take a picture of it; find out what the possible charge may be and keep the equipment until you have reached an agreement."
"Carrie of Richmond, VA",4/27/2013,,"Comcast has been over to my house for over 15 times to correct issues (all while me waiting for 4 hours at a time for a servicer to come for cable, internet and phone service, unpaid). I have even contacted the corporate office in the past. I called 3 weeks ago to advise that I was switching to Verizon due to them charging me $150.00 on my bill, yet they advertise $89.00 for all three package on TV. The lady I spoke to advised that she was reducing my bill back down to $99.00 for all three and sending me a free DVR for a year at no charge with free HBO for 3 months. When I got my bill, they did charge me for DVR and still over $150.00. 3 weeks later, my DVR is not working and either is my cable. When I called, they advised the DVR is broken and they want to send out a technician on Monday. I work and am missing pay for every time they have had to come out here. When I asked for a corporate number, Anne Marie (the manager) advised that she did not know it. She advised that she would have her supervisor contact me back, but couldn't give me their name or number. So I am being charged still over $150.00 a month with a broken service and being charged for services I was told were free, and that they wouldn't charge me anything besides $99.00 for everything. I am still sitting here with a broken equipment that doesn't work and a bill that is overcharged without a resolution. When I googled the corporate number, they advised that the office was closed? This company is a bait and switch. To bring broken equipment about ten times to my house, as well as overcharge me and not reimburse me for the time taken off work for me to wait for their service techs, I should be reimbursed for everything! $100.00 at lowest for every time they have come out here for me to miss pay is $1,500.00. That is a year's service for free!"
"Mr of Huntington, WV",5/1/2013,,"A Comcast tech came to my home to investigate an outage. While on the outside of my home and out of sight of myself or members of my family, the rep was working on the box and both the TVs in my home started to sizzle and smoke. My girlfriend went outside to investigate, while the rep rushed to the door, said that nothing was his fault and then left. Upon reviewing the damage, I lost 2 TVs, the washer and dryer, the stove and fridge to this incident. 24 hrs later and plenty of time spent on the phone with Comcast, they say that the rep said there was a voltage issue. With that, I contacted my electrical company to investigate. They made a few minor repairs but said the tech grounded a wire that wasn't supposed to be grounded and that was what caused the issue. So in trying to contact Comcast again, I have been confronted with not being able to reach a rep over the phone. It keeps saying my call can't be connected but I sat with a friend that has Comcast and let them go through the prompts and was able to reach a rep just fine. What do I need to do because this is flat out wrong? They shouldn't take the word of a shady tech that wouldn't stay behind to fix his mess or take the time to properly investigate what happened. My 23-mo.-old child won't play in his room by himself anymore. Anytime we walk past his room, he just repeats, ""Fire, fire, fire!"" This is inhuman and I will not rest until they fix the damage they have done."
"Amanda of Nashville, TN",5/2/2013,,"After a year of dissatisfactory service with another cable, phone & internet company, I decided I would try Comcast. I set everything up online including the Triple Play package and the installation day and time. I immediately received a confirmation email but the package details were slightly different than what I had setup so I called Comcast and they verified that I would have everything that I ordered and they even verified the installation date & time, which was a week later on April 24, 5:00-7:00 pm. The installation time came and no one showed up. At 7:00 pm, I called Comcast and had to talk to 3 different people, repeat my information and the issue 3 different times. The first 2 people were hard to understand because of the strong accent and I could barely hear the 3rd person. The last person said that she put in an expedited ticket and someone would call me at 2:30 the next afternoon. That time came and went so I called again, which resulted in talking to 3 more people! The 3rd person was in sales and she was helpful but I had to go through the steps of setting up what I wanted and another installation date. The reason no one showed up the day before was that someone at Comcast cancelled my installation on April 23rd because there was a porting issue. Did anyone bother to call me and let me know? No! So, I set up another installation date for April 30, 3:00-5:00. Yes, I had to wait another 5 days. The salesperson stated that she follows all of her orders and she would contact me if there was an issue. On April 29, I received a phone call confirming the installation date and time. On April 30, I left work early to make the appointment but no one showed up and no one called to notify me of any issues again! I called Comcast and the person said she could schedule the installation for the next day but I angrily told her no and that I wanted to know what the problem was. She put me on hold. When she came back, she said she had put in an expedited ticket and that the technician team/dept would be calling me in 30 minutes. I never heard from anyone that night or the next day including the original salesperson that supposedly follows all her orders! Today, May 2, I decided to call Comcast to find out why no one showed up. Once again, I had to talk to multiple people and repeatedly provide my information. The last person said she did not know why it happened but that the installation was still outstanding. To find out why, she would have to open a case file and the dispatch department would call me back because they were the only ones that would know why no one showed up on the correct day. I told her that I had thought Comcast would be better than my current provider but obviously they were not and I was done because no one can give a straight answer to anything. Nothing but the runaround! So she asked if I wanted to cancel my installation. I suppose they were going to show up whenever they wanted."
"Dean of Memphis, TN",5/3/2013,,"I had Comcast for over 20 years in California and when I moved to Memphis, I ordered the internet, phone and cable TV from Comcast again. I was very clear that lines would need to be run in the living room and the den. The first visit was by a man who said he only did wireless service so he hooked up the wireless for my laptop only, leaving loose wires lying on the floor at the only cable outlet in my house. He said he would put in a service call for an ""installer"" to hook up my TV and phone and PC. The appointment was for Saturday, 9 to 11 am. At 11:30 am, I received a call telling me they were overbooked so I rescheduled for Tuesday from 3 to 5 pm.At almost 5 pm, a ""repair tech"" showed up saying he did not run cable, only repaired existing service. I had to phone in for another appointment for Friday between 1 and 3 pm. This is the 4th appointment and it is now 4:45 pm and I have received no phone call that they would be late. I am convinced that Comcast in the Memphis area is too stupid to be in business. I called just now and I believe I was talking to India and was told the ""installer"" would show up but they don't know when. I suggest anyone who reads this should not use Comcast - the worst customer service I have ever experienced."
"Budhadeb of Naperville, IL",5/4/2013,,"I installed Comcast service in my Vero Beach, Florida home in February 2013 when the property was rented out. After a month when the renters left, I called Comcast to put the service for minimum charges at $39.99 per month. I then received a bill showing full charges and called Comcast about my conversation with their customer support. Comcast agents flatly denied that such charges were approved. I then asked them to put the property on seasonal hold and they agreed to do so. It has been over a month and I still continue to receive the same charges. When I called twice, nothing got taken care of in the account. Just suffering. Every time you call Comcast, it takes 40 minutes to talk to a live person. This is customer service."
"Connie of Stockton, CA",5/11/2013,,"On Tuesday, May 7, 2013 at 6:00 pm, my TV Comcast froze on ""One Moment Please."" After waiting 15 minutes, I made an attempt to call Comcast with a 15-minute wait time. The agent that I was finally connected with had me try several ways of resolving the problem to no avail. She indicated that my box would probably need to be swapped out and set me up with a Thursday appointment, between 8-10 am. She also told me to unplug the TV and that a technician would be calling me back in 45 minutes. After waiting 1 hour 15 minutes, I called Comcast back with another 15-minute wait before I was connected with an agent in South America. She had me jump through the same hoops as the first agent and after being asked for the last four numbers of my SS#, I said I needed to speak with an agent in the US. After another long wait, I was connected to an agent in the Philippines. She started the whole process again and after having her repeat the same instructions over and over, I told her I could not do this anymore (it was now 10:00pm!) and I hung up. Knowing I had a Thursday morning appointment, I decided to wait until then. Thursday morning, I called to confirm the appointment and was told that I did not have an appointment! The agent then again tried to correct the problem to no avail and scheduled an appointment for Friday, May 10 between 4-6 pm. Again, I called that day at 4:45 pm to confirm and that agent insisted on trying to resolve the issue by phone. The technician then called and arrived to correct the problem. He left my residence at approximately 7:00 pm on Friday evening. At 9:59 am Saturday morning, my TV again froze showing ""One Moment Please."" I called Comcast at 10:15am and it was 1/2 hour before I could get through again being connected to the Philippines! I immediately asked to be connected to an agent in the US because the line was static and I could not understand the agent. She wanted all my personal information and after providing this, she still wanted the last four of my SS# which I refused to provide. She then put me on hold and another agent after a 1/2 hour wait answered the phone and when asked, indicated he too was located in the Philippines. Then he told me that he is not in the department I need and another agent from the Philippines took the call. It is now 11:00 am and she assured me that a technician will be calling me back in 30 minutes! So far, I have been without a TV for 78 hours and have been on the phone for approximately 8 hours trying to resolve this problem."
"Woodrow of Florence, AL",5/11/2013,,"After moving into our new house, we decided to go with Comcast Cable; especially since the house was wired for it. We had repeated problems with the service - the internet would drop off, sometimes for days, and channels were either fuzzy or had so much static you could not watch them at all. After months of constant phone calls, waiting on repair trucks and several agents at the end who were unreasonably rude (one actually yelled and hung up on me), we changed and went with a new ISP and television service provider.We had a remaining balance left on our bill. We spoke to management about how to close the account, and asked if there could be some type of settlement/agreement that we can reach since we feel we did not receive the quality of service that allowed us to use either the television or internet more than 50% of the time. We were asked if a representative, who could take care of this, could call us back. The next day, we spoke to an agent who informed us the balance would be taken care of, and we would owe nothing. We hoped they would pro-rate the bill somehow, and we were never expecting that response.We decided recently to try the new internet after being told it was better and more reliable by a representative who came to our door promoting it. The problem now is, the balance was not altered and all record of our problems, months of trouble and wasted time is nonexistent. Since no contact was attempted, we believed that the account was taken care of since it has been 3 to 4 years, and we were contacted 2 years ago to switch back. Surely, if you owed a company trying to get your business back, they would mention an outstanding balance.On 5/11/13, Mr. ** spoke with Teresa **. Mr. ** stated a settlement of $40.85 would be applied basing this on the $122.55/mo. for 10 days of loss reported from November 2008 (continually) until February 2009; and using payment records showing 28 months out of 40 were late. This was due to discontent of poor and/or non-working service, having to go elsewhere for a stable internet connection or send emails, and had to disconnect the television service in December 2008 due to poor quality (some channels with no reception at all). We were not taken seriously until the withholding of payment occurred causing some bills to be past due. I believe we were also charged after we told them to disconnect service and had attained another provider.I told Mr. ** that I do not accept that amount. I feel 10 days does not accurately portray the ongoing problem we had started reporting in November and continued through to February, where he stated Comcast tried three times to contact us but failed; thus closing the trouble ticket. I have always returned any calls from them; however, this could occur when you have an internet phone and a properly working internet connection. He stated this was all he could authorize. We were not the only one with the same problem. Our neighbors picked up the vigil and also reported the same conditions with the same outcome. The connection was not repaired to working condition in any of our households.By contacting us and offering a credit to what they have considered as nothing more than a minor problem that does not affect them, we feel this is an insult to our name and what we stand for. As it is just one family against a large corporation, what more could we possibly do?"
"Stephen  of Sarasota, FL",5/13/2013,,I have not received my April bill. I received a past due notice. I cannot pay my bill if I did not receive one. Customer service is useless. The supervisor won't call you back.
"lura of Ft Myers, FL",5/13/2013,,"Upon signing up a new account with Comcast in 2011, my intro rate was $99 Triple Play. We all know it's never just that rate. I knew this rate would change as they told me it was an intro for the 1st year. After that year, I had renegotiated a rate that ended up costing me about $15 more a month, a regular rate. I did not know it was promotional and would at the 1st of the year 2013 go from $130/mo. to $210+ a month. I pay my bill with my auto payments online. Bank auto sends the money. Then in March, I got a possible service Interruption about owing over $400. What?! I pay my bills every month. I began calling Comcast to talk with a customer ""no"" service rep. 10 times I called. I actually began keeping track, as the Robo Operator told me they were too busy to take my call at this time, to please try again later. Two weeks later, I finally got through. After anxiety attacks over this, I went over the past 3 bills that I felt were overcharged and never was told my bill would hike up $80 extra a month and I would cancel my phone and change internet to save money. This rep told me to keep the bundle and she could give a year rate of $145/mo. - again a $15 rate hike but this would only be good for one year and to negotiate next year in April. And she had adjusted my bills from the 1st of the year, and the difference I owed now was $32 and I promptly paid it, and agreed to the $145. After 45 min on the phone I thought I was done.I received a disconnect notice today that I owe $295 the back differences from the beginning of the year or they will cut the service off. I finally got a rep back on the phone and told him that this was resolved 2 weeks ago, and credit should be posted and my new bill is $145/mo. After a very heated uncooperative person, he decided to send it to the Account Review board, basically calling me a liar, that maybe, just maybe, their Customer Rep in April told me what I wanted to hear to get me off the phone, as she told me I only owed $32 difference after the credits and payments I had made. Comcast told me I must not have understood anything, and I'm responsible to Comcast for the Rate Rape increase on Jan.1 2013 of an extra $80/mo, so if I'd have caught it that 1st month, this would not be the issue. Comcast is a scam with rate increases not agreed upon by the user, I would never agree to pay nor could I afford to pay over $200/mo. for cable, phone, internet and why they offer it at $99 to new customers, but when you're a good paying customer, they screw you over! Comcast even acknowledged me as a good customer at Christmas 2012 by sending me a gift card for free movies on demand! That must have been their way of saying sorry for their huge rate increase on Jan 1, 2013."
"Mb of Jacksonville, FL",5/14/2013,,"For the past 6 months, my bill has changed. It's different every month, charging me for services I never ordered, tacking on service fees and the latest is the taxes went up. I have been a faithful long-time customer. Now, it seems they can do whatever they want and we are stuck. I will be moving in July and will not be taking Comcast with me."
"NICOLETTE of Tacoma, WA",5/14/2013,,"Timothy, I hear you about your issue with Comcast PNW. They have a monopoly everywhere, but at least in Tacoma, I can switch to a dish provider or Click! Cable. I had the same problem with their Signature Support. I received a benign-looking card in the mail over a month ago and thought it was weird but unfortunately, I didn't call Comcast. I just thought they were rolling out some new type of service and were trying to get me to sign up. Boy, was I wrong! Later that month, I received my bill and to my surprise, there was a $14.95 charge + $4.98 partial month charge for something called Signature Support, as of early April. I did not ever, ever sign up for that crap. I tried calling but hold time was ridiculously long! I tried calling customer service, emailing, chatting online, etc. and every time, theyâ€™re like, ""You need to call Signature Support."" Some help!This costs $15/month? Anyways, things came up and next thing you know, it's my next billing cycle and I'm reminded of the charges again. I called and waited 30 minutes. I finally got through to a foreign call center and asked for this service to be removed and the charges credited, since I never asked for it. The rep said she won't be to do that for me. She's so sorry but it's been over 30 days since and said that I added it. Did she not just hear me say I didn't add it and that I have no idea why it's on there? How can Comcast add a service without my consent and not refund the charges because I didn't call back in time? In the 5+ years since I've been a Comcast customer, I have needed their help with a service issue once. That's it! I asked her if she could please play the recorded call in which I (or someone authorized, like my husband) asked for this service and agreed to the charges. She put me on hold for a few minutes, came back and said they don't have it. So, no concrete proof exists with me or my husband asking for this new monthly service charge to be added to the account? Unreal! At that point, the rep began her stonewall routine, so I asked for a supervisor. She sent me over after another 10 minute hold and I'm greeted to broken English along with an amazing amount of buzzing, ringing, whizzing and static on the line (not me, btw), not to mention the same old routine of talking over me, telling me they understand, putting me on hold, etc. I got all the info I could get about the supposed call in which these service were added, like the date, time, rep I spoke with. They, of course, couldn't tell me who called in. But I'm sorry, without real proof of this call like a recording, the charges need to be credited. I made that clear but they had to escalate my issue and I'll be hearing back (meaning I'll receive a call) within the next 48 hours. Unbelievable that I would be treated so poorly after being a loyal Comcast customer for this long! Inexcusable! I can make no other conclusion here but that Comcast is crooked and they are deliberately signing people up for this junk without asking so that they can make a few extra bucks. Blegh! It makes me sick. "
"Navin of Sammamish, WA",5/17/2013,,"I live in Sammamish, WA where Comcast is the monopoly cable company. I have been having problems with my internet and cable service for over a month. Comcast has the worst customer service process for customers to even get to somebody to report problems. It takes 20 minutes on average to get someone on the line while they are blasting you with commercials as you hold for a live person. They make you repeat the same info about tel. #, address, last four digits of social, etc.Half the people answering the phone cannot communicate properly in English. It is like the company wants people to get frustrated holding the line forever to get a representative and give up instead of solving their problems. All the while, they keep raising rates and trying to upsell services while you are just complaining about not getting even the basic service in spite of paying for it. It seems like there is no way to get your problems addressed by Comcast. I welcome any suggestions on how to get Comcast to respond to customers' service problems."
"Dani of Sicklerville, NJ",5/17/2013,,"Well, let's see. I just got off a 4-hour ordeal with crappy Comcast. I spent all day long with no wireless internet. My kids were freaking out of course because they couldn't get online, due to the fact that my kids had games tonight. I had to wait until we got home to fix this problem. I knew it would take a while on the phone but this was ridiculous. Once we got home, I called Comcast 800 number, went through the prompts and ended up being connected with someone in the internet service department. This was after the fact that I had already tried unplugging the modem, resetting the router (which usually works) and calling once to have them send a signal to the modem/router. So the guy gets on the phone. Of course, he has an accent. I proceeded to tell him everything and all that I had tried, he had me once again unplug the router restart my computer and send a signal. After all of this, it continued to say I was connected but I still had no internet. There was a yellow triangle and he told me that was not their problem so he had to transfer me. So I waited again on hold. Another person picked up the phone. I couldn't understand him, let alone hear him because the line had so much static. I told him I couldn't hear him and told him what was going on. After trying to understand what he was trying to tell me for 10 minutes, I was so aggravated I just hung up the phone. I tried again to reset everything and still nothing. So I called back again and after pressing 20 buttons, I sat on hold because the recording claimed at 1am they had high volume. I don't know how many people are calling Comcast support at 1am but I sat on hold for 40 minutes. Finally, someone answered the phone. I asked her to just connect me to a manager. Once again, I was placed on hold and waited 15 minutes. The manager finally gets on the phone and was completely rude. I told him everything that had happened and that I was at this point aggravated. He told me they did what they could and that the router wasn't Comcastâ€™s and that he was showing that the signal was fine. I asked him then why wouldn't I have internet if this was the case. He wouldn't even explain anything to me. He just told me to take the hard wire and plug it in my laptop! I was like you got to be kidding me! I pay for the service so I can connect on my devices, not so I have to sit there with a wire. So he told me I had to speak with the other wireless department and that this didn't concern them. I sat on hold again and some lady picked up. I once again explained to her what's going on and that it said I'm connected but the page doesn't load, etc. I told her I even plugged the hard wire from the modem into my laptop and still had nothing, which wouldn't be possible if it were working. She told me that in order for her to help me with anything, she needed me to pay a fee of $15 and a registration fee of $40. I couldn't believe it! I was then really pissed and just hung up on her. So after four hours of getting no help and being told I had to pay money for them to help me connect to my service I pay for every month, now pissed off I sat there unplugging everything pushing every reset button, etc and by some miracle, once I plugged everything back in, it worked! So thank you to myself for getting my internet back on. Comcast blows. They are rude, ignorant idiots that don't help you with crap, but have no problem charging you out the ** for their crappy services. I am definitely looking into getting a different provider!"
"Tristian  of Houston, TX",5/20/2013,,"I called to see if there was something that I could do about my bill so extremely expensive every month. I was told that no one would be able to assist me with my account until I paid my bill. My current bill is about $600 and for what reason, I'm not at home that much to watch TV/use the internet or any other service that they may provide. Why in the Sam Hill is my bill so enormous and then when I call to get a resolution, not one customer service agent wants to help me understand what the heck is going on. I am livid at how much Comcast is trying to charge me for services, and there is actually no way to measure usage. This is absolutely freaking ridiculous and the sad part is that they are basically getting over!"
"Vickie of Franklin, TN",5/21/2013,,"I pay over $300 a month for the bundle service - cable TV, telephone and internet. I have three televisions on HD cable and pay extra for each of the HD boxes. The biggest problem we have is with the internet service. The service will all of a sudden disconnect from the Internet. When you troubleshoot the problem, it will say check your modem/router connections, which I have done. We have several computers in the house and the disconnect does not happen all at once - it is random on each computer. It would seem to me if there was a router/modem connection problem that they would all go down at the same time. You can be responding to an email and go to send your response - no connection. I have tried to contact customer service and have not been connected. I tried to email them two days ago and my entire email system went down and I did not receive emails yesterday. I have not called because I know they will say it is my equipment and we will have to buy new/pay for a service visit. We have been customers of Comcast since they first entered the market here over 25 years ago. We are starting to look at other options. I am tired of being held hostage. If it were just me, I would disconnect everything but I have a sports fanatic and grandchildren who watch on-demand and cartoon network."
"Debra of Antioch, TN",5/21/2013,,"On 5/11/13, a payment was dropped off for Jerome **. The line was outside the door, as normal. I put a $150 money order in the drop box (money order # **, a global no.). I called to make sure payment was received; they said no, that I had to wait for 5 business days. So I went back on 5/17/13 and gave the lady at the counter a copy of the m.o. She said that someone would call me. I never heard from anyone so I went back on 5/20/13. Still, there was no help. I asked for a supervisor and they said it would be 1 hour. I proceeded to wait on the supervisor for about 45 min. My sister came down to Comcast and still there were no results. We were headed to the corporate office and she drove around to the side of the building. A gentleman came out and she talked to him giving him the info and the phone number where she could be reached. He said that he would text a supervisor. On 5/21/13, someone finally contacted her around 3:00 or 4:00 and told her for me not to pay with money order any more. That money had been applied to someone else's account, and they could not take it off. She had to put a tracer on the money order and pay $15 to do that. Time has been wasted, as well as gas."
"Maritza  of Gaithersburg, MD",5/21/2013,,"Comcast is charging me $270.30 for 8 movies I did not watch and each movie cost $13.99. I would like Comcast to help me immediately because I have not watched these movies. For more information, you can email me at **. Thank you and I hope Comcast can help."
"Christina of Lompoc, CA",5/23/2013,,"Last month in April, I called Comcast due to a problem with the router and internet connection. After troubleshooting the problem, Customer Support offered me a promotion package for higher internet speed and basic cable for $34.99 per month, plus $7 for the router rental, so the total came to $41.99 per month and was $5 cheaper than the $47 I was already paying for just internet. The $50 for the service/cable installation was waived. So, I agreed to the promotion because it was not costing me anything and I was also saving $5 a month. I also asked to be notified 30 days prior to the promotion ending so I would not be charged a higher rate. I paid the pro-rated amount of $38.34 on 4/08/13 and had a zero balance. I have paperless billing so on 5/20/13 I signed into Comcast to view and pay my bill and was shocked when the balance owed was $133. I called Comcast and was told that $50 was for the cable installation and the rest was for cable and internet. The supervisor I spoke with is named Angel ID **. He was rude and could not explain to me why the installation charge was added a month later. He argued with me and said the installation was not waived and my monthly rate was higher $47 and not $41.99. He refused to give me the address to their head office so I could file a complaint and the phone number he gave me 1-503-617-1248 is no good. This is not the first time I had a problem with Comcast billing. When I fist signed up with Comcast in August 2012, they tried to give me a promotional package and I refused and explained the disaster I just had had with Verizon's package. I made it clear I did not want a package, only basic internet where I can watch shows on my laptop. I was given a price of $56 per month, and agreed. In February, I went into our local Comcast office to pay my bill and was told I owed $164 due to my promotion ending 2 months prior and I owed $85 per month for internet.I almost canceled my service but my son said, ""See if they have a lower internet speed,"" and of course they did, for $47 per month. Not only was I put in a promotion when I did not want one, but I was also charged a higher internet speed than was necessary. It seems that consumers are at the mercy of Cable companies. Comcast does as it pleases; it promises promotions at a low price and then 30 days later, adds new charges so they can get more money out of a person. I know I am not the only one who has problems with Comcast. Their billing is unethical; charges that are agreed upon should not be raised at a later date."
"Christopher  of Jacksonville, FL",5/23/2013,,"I am writing on behalf of my mother and her husband, Diane and Willis **, at **, Jacksonville, FL 32216. They are an elderly couple and have been having serious issues with Comcast Cable for several months involving ongoing outages of phone and internet service. On multiple occasions, I've had to contact Comcast over no home phone service and internet. I have on several occasions had to take (what Comcast referred to as) faulty equipment to the service center to exchange in hopes of fixing the issues. After several attempts and phone calls, I complained enough to where Comcast agreed to send a technician to check out the problems. When the technician arrived and examined the wiring, he admitted that Comcast installers did not wire the home appropriately and that he would have to call and set an appointment for the Comcast installers to re-wire the home properly. That appointment was set for 05/14/2013 from between 10 am and 12 noon. No one ever showed or called. I called Comcast a total of seven times throughout the day to find out the delays and I was promised every time that a technician would be there shortly. By 6:30 pm no one showed. I then called and demanded to talk to a supervisor, who instead of working out a way of correcting the problem, gave me the run-around and even tried to blame me for 1st, rescheduling the appointment to another date (which I did not do); 2nd, insisted that the installers called and no one was home (no home phone service, i.e., how can anyone answer the call?). They were given both mine and my wife's cell numbers which they did not call either and can be verified with phone records. And 3rdly, that a technician tried came to the house and no one was home (I had been there since 8:30 am and never left, as well as two other adults were also there the entire time). At this time, the service has still not been fixed though the account has always been paid in full each and every month. Finally, Comcast technicians came out to re-wire the house on 05/15/2013. When completed, the tech said all should be fine and in less than an hour after the tech left, phone service was completely gone again. Since that day, phone service and internet are still intermittent at best. I've talked to over a dozen different people with Comcast customer (no) service and still do not have the problem resolved. Even today, 05/23/2013, an appointment was scheduled from 1 pm - 3 pm - no show. At 2:55 pm, I received a call stating that Comcast would be there before 3:30 pm. As of 5 pm this afternoon, no one has yet shown. Now that's a total of 3 appointments that Comcast made and confirmed they did not show to fix a problem that they themselves are responsible for.I personally feel that Comcast has gone out of their way to not provide service due the fact that the customers are elderly and in an older neighborhood. Comcast has the monopoly on being the only cable and high speed internet provider in Jacksonville, Florida and they couldn't care less of customer care or quality at any level. I have filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau and I am waiting for information from the Florida State Attorney's Office as well."
"Kenneth  of Lake Wales, FL",5/23/2013,,"Had Comcast for several months. I called on February 23, 2013 with my girlfriend and her daughter there to cancel my services with them. I was told it would be done. In April, we got a bill for $259.73 which they kept services on until April 2013. We moved out the next day and someone else moved in shortly. Called them numerous times to rectify and they refused. I was told I was being sent to collections and they verified all merchandise returned. Each time a call is made, they say I did not call them. Can you assist with this? "
"Anoop of Smyrna, GA",5/25/2013,,"Brief: Comcast missed 2 installation appointments in a row and said they can't give the $20 statement credit for missing the appointments. After missing the 2nd appointment, the agent said somebody from Dispatch will call me soon, but nobody called. More details below.1) I had an installation scheduled for 05/23/13 between 1-3pm. No one showed up until 3pm, I called up customer care. They said the appointment was cancelled because I didn't confirm the appointment. I had received the automated call in the morning but the options were - ""press 1 to cancel the appointment, press 2 to change the appointment. To keep the appointment, no further action is necessary and you may hang up."" I told them about the automated call but they said that I had to press some number for confirmation, which I didn't, and that next time, if I am not sure, call customer care and they will confirm it for me.2) I got the 2nd installation appointment for 05/25/13 between 3-5pm. I got the automated call, and this time I listened carefully and made sure I wasn't wrong the first time. There is no option to confirm the appointment. It said, to keep the appointment, no action is needed from me, just hang up. I didn't want to miss the appointment again so I called back and pressed 6 for appointments. There was an option to press 1 to confirm the appointment, I pressed 1 and the system said that my appointment is confirmed. But just to be sure, I spoke to an agent and he said my appointment is confirmed and no further action is necessary.I waited till 5pm but no one showed up. Called customer care again, they said the appointment is cancelled again because I didn't confirm the appointment. I explained everything, the agent apologized and said the dispatch itself will call me soon today. I asked about the $20 statement credit, so she said the dispatch is entering a code for appointment not confirmed, so she can't do the $20 credit. I explained the whole thing and said I confirmed using option 6 for appointments, 1 to confirm, the system confirmed, an agent confirmed, etc., but she still said the system won't let her do the credit and I have to take it up with the dispatch department. Till now dispatch hasn't called me, looks like I will be staying an AT&T customer for now."
"Deloris of Marietta, GA",5/25/2013,,"I was told on April 10th that a credit would be applied to my account and my service would be changed so I would benefit from the promotions again, because my account services were changed and my bill was higher than what I was quoted. I was previously given a promotion, but because of the misrepresentation of the cost, I would be able to get the promotions put back on my account. The old were soon to end, so the changes to the services weren't going to be made right away. However, after going through several people and the corporate office, there weren't any notes explaining why I was going to be given the credits. Several representatives saw the credits but said there was no explanation, so they transferred me back and forth between Billing and the resolution department.I got tired and called corporate, not to mention that a couple of the representatives were rude, not everyone. But when I spoke with the corporate office, she said she only saw where I said I was to receive the credits but it wasn't noted. I realize they are a company that doesn't care about integrity. Even though they express customer satisfaction, it's just talk. The only reason I put up with them as long as I have is because, in the area I live in, there was nothing else available. I'm glad to be moving, and I will make certain it's an area that offers something other than Comcast. I saw the donations they have made, I think we helped to make that possible. They shouldn't get all the credit. I know I've paid much more than I should have for their service. I hear other people on the job complain about the problems they have with Comcast, and I will complain to Consumer Affairs, and hope others that have problems complain. They need to be stopped."
"Laura of Golden Valley, MN",5/27/2013,,"I began calling Comcast in the fall of 2012 to bury the cable, trying to coordinate it with the burial of the power and phone cables. After a couple of months of repeated phone calls and no assistance, I was told that my account had been flagged to say that our city does not allow them to bury cables. This is incorrect information. I verified with our city that this is not the case, and called Comcast back again. I continued to get blown off until winter hit and they were not able to do the work because of frozen ground. I began calling again a month ago after the snow melted. I have called REPEATEDLY, and was just now told that it will be another four weeks!! It has already been 7 months!!"
"Pete of Hammonton, NJ",5/29/2013,,"I am disabled and on a fixed income. I can't walk. All I do is watch TV. I opened my bill and it had gone up over 15 percent to well over $200. Where is the State of New Jersey Board of Public Utilities? When I called, they told me I could lock in at$ 200 and some odd dollars for two years because it is going to go up again! Where's our consumer protection? I started my bundle at $99 but over $200 for cable?! It's more than my gas and electric; in fact it's my largest bill. Something has got to be done about these **."
"Tiwana  of Sugarland, Tx , TX",5/30/2013,,"My name is Tiwana and I am a new Comcast Cable customer. I am writing you this letter to inform you how I was treated as a new customer with Comcast Cable. My first phone call to Comcast was around on 5/7/2013, and my first appointment was scheduled on 5/11/2013. On this day, I was very excited because I had waited for services and was excited about getting new cable service as I had been with AT&T for the past 4 years. When the technicians arrived (4 of them), they quickly stated that we had no signal and the work ceased at that point. They advised me that they would have to send someone back, later on in the day to setup the service. A gentleman did arrive a few hours later but left without advising us of anything and also not installing the service. I called Comcast back and spoke with someone who guaranteed me that my services would be fully installed no later than Sunday, 5/12/2013 (all 4 rooms). He also stated that he would call and check on me by Monday, 5/13/2013, to make sure that everything was done. Since I was provided this information, I called into work on Monday, 5/13/2013, and took the day off. I called Comcast back again on Monday and was told that the only thing that could be done is to schedule another appointment for later on in the week. This really frustrated me, so I requested to speak with a supervisor. On this day, I spoke with Tracy ** and was told that there was nothing she could do, and I would have to setup another appointment which would be 5/17/2013. This was unacceptable to me, because I had already set an appointment that was not kept. Ms. ** stated that she would escalate this issue and that someone would be calling me back. I never received a call back. I contacted Comcast again Tuesday, 5/14/2013, and spoke with someone named George that apologized for all the inconvenience and promised credits on my account. Credits are nice but means nothing if you canâ€™t use the service. George also advised me to just keep the appointment scheduled for 5/17/2013, because there was nothing else he could do. At that time, I confirmed that they would be installing all 4 rooms in my home. I was told yes. On May 17, 2013, someone came to my home to install the security system and only one room in my home. At that time, I advised the gentlemen that I had a total of 4 rooms and was told that he only had a work order for 1 room. By this time, I am extremely frustrated because I knew that this was not how you treat new customers. I then called Comcast back and spoke with someone, who again apologized for the inconvenience and offered me another appointment. By this time, I did not want to set another appointment. The only appointment they could give me was the next week. I then thought about canceling the service. Why? I have been in customer service for 14 years and knew that this was not how you treat a new customer. I knew the CEO of Comcast never thought their new customers would be treated this way. Because my family really needed the service, I picked myself back up and set an appointment for Saturday, 5/25/2013. I knew the difficulties I had previously, so I followed up to make sure that my appointment was set. On Wednesday, 5/22/2013, I spoke with someone named Alfred, who confirmed my appointment for 5/25/2013 between 8am-10am. I also confirmed that they would be installing the additional 3 rooms that were never completed. Alfred confirms everything and again apologized.On Thursday, 5/23/2013, someone shows up at my house (while Iâ€™m at work) stating that we had technical difficulties. Luckily my husband was home, but we had no technical difficulties. The gentleman then stated that the appointment had been set for 5/22/2013 and not the date I was told of, 5/25/2013. He had no boxes to install as he was only there because the work order showed technical difficulties. This enraged me because this is not how you do business. A new customer should not be treated this way. When I returned home, I quickly contacted Comcast and requested to speak with a supervisor. I spoke with Jill first who stated that I never had an appointment scheduled for 5/25/2013. I was then transferred to her supervisor Jason. Jason apologized to me and stated that he would make sure that someone would be at my home to finish the installation on 5/25/2013 between 8am-10am. To ensure this was done, he also provided me his managerâ€™s name which was Jerry. On Saturday, 5/25/2013, I called after 10am to confirm that my appointment would go as scheduled as the installer was now late. I spoke with William who confirmed the appointment between 8am-10am and asked me to give them more time to show up. Nobody ever showed up. I allowed some more time to pass. In the afternoon, I called back and spoke with someone named Jean who stated that the appointment was never set. I no longer wanted a supervisor and wanted a manager now. I spoke with a manager named Eric ID# ** who told me that he would take care of everything. By this time, it was 7:30pm in the evening. He stated that he would have someone come out in the evening. I asked him when would be the latest they could install my cable and was told by midnight. Per manager Eric, someone would be out by midnight. I was also provided with ticket# **. Nobody ever came nor did I receive any call back from anyone. To whoever is reading this letter, I appreciate your time. I just had to let you know that Comcast has lost a customer that truly wanted their service. First I was angry and then upset. Now, my feelings are just hurt. How can you treat a new customer like this? The way I have been treated is totally unacceptable. This is just not the way to keep customers. I am writing this letter to hopefully help the next customer that is treated this way. All I wanted was cable in all four of my rooms and the security system. Now, it truly hurts me that I must take my business elsewhere. Thank you so much for you time. I just had to let you know what happened to me so it wonâ€™t happen to someone else."
"Jenifer of La Vergne, TN",5/30/2013,,"I signed up for Comcast TV and Internet package for 6 months and I called and cancelled the TV portion and kept the internet in March of 2013. Well, the TV was never taken off my account and I was charged for 2 months of TV service that I never used at $145+. On top of that, our internet wants to work when it feels like it. Our cell phone bills have been double b/c we are being charged for data usage when we think we are connected to WiFi in our townhouse. I called the customer service line and was put on hold for 45 minutes. Then I asked to speak with someone that could maybe troubleshoot our internet issues. The guys told me that Comcast doesn't provide the Modem when internet is installed so now I have a modem that was broken from the beginning. I opened my bill for this month and mind you, I should only be charged around $70 for just the internet and my bill was $304.45... I was LIVID. I called the service number back again and asked to speak to a supervisor... I was put on hold for over an hour and then they said they would call me back within two hours. I never got a phone call. I called again the following day and was put on hold for 38 minutes and was told the same thing, someone would call me back. So with the amount of frustration I had, I just hung up. I finally contacted someone in the corporate office and I do have to say they were very helpful. I know how important customer service is. Speaking from experience, I just cannot believe how horrible the service is at Comcast. So today, I am cancelling my account and I'm not paying my last bill."
"Brandy of Bethel, DE",5/30/2013,,"I have had the absolute worst service imaginable from Comcast's chosen rebate vendor, Saveology. Eighteen weeks have passed and no rebate for my router and modem which were to be ""free"" according to their sales rep when I switched from DirecTV to Comcast. Now, it's going to be another 8 weeks for my check because they're backed up?! No! Ten to sixteen weeks was what was on the form and even that is too long! Saveology simply told me that I would be forced to wait, and Comcast isn't replying via Facebook at all. I plan to continue calling and hounding them. This is poor service at the worst."
"Michael of Chicago, IL",5/30/2013,,"Comcast has for years overcharged us for every service we have received. They utilize deceptive and unfair consumer business practice as a part of their regular day to day operations. They give you defective equipment designed to work for a limited time. So that when it fails, they can send technicians to your home and then subsequently charge you for sending the technicians out to your home. Comcast also has on many occasions remotely deactivated our modems and BLOCKED any and all attempts to reactivate them once again, so that they can send a technician out to our home and subsequently charge us for that service.Comcast has also repeatedly raised our rates without notifying us. One example is this. We received calls 5 times a day for over 6 months prodding us to upgrade to blast Internet for $5 extra per month. And every time, we refused. Immediately after the 6th month, they suddenly raised our Internet cost by $5. THIS WAS well after our price increased upon the expiration of our promo deal. They have since raised our Internet rates by a cost of $1 every 3 months to the point we now pay $85 a month for Internet. These are only a few examples of what we've gone through. In my experience, Comcast operates its business in a fashion that is similar to the Mafia. Comcast is a criminal organization and a national scam. Their business thrives on the use of unfair and deceptive business practices. In Chicago, Comcast likes to hire known felons as their technicians. People have actually been murdered or robbed by Comcast technicians. They've had their homes burglarized. And on several occasions, Comcast as an act of punishing consumers for their disloyalty (speaking out), Comcast has deactivated their cable boxes and had technicians replace those boxes with roach infested equipment. Comcast is a criminal monopolistic enterprise which should be disbanded and destroyed for the sake and safety of the consumer."
"Erica of Shreveport, LA",5/30/2013,,"First of all, I was having cable TV installed in two rooms. The technician arrived two hours after the time period as promised. He told me since I live in apartments that he can't install any new outlets. I had one existing outlet that he hooked the box up to. He told me that I can use a splitter for service for my other TV. He said since he didn't install a new outlet that he can't leave the receiver but all I would have to do is pick it up at their location. My bill came in and I was charged for two outlets. I got the phone rep to take one off. She also stated to me just to use a splitter. I went to their location and was told they were not allowed to give me an extra box and stated that the tech and phone rep misinformed me. I would have never gotten their service if I couldn't watch both TVs. Secondly, the service is horrible! My service has gone out multiple times for hours at a time. Plus, about 80% of the time when I try to watch On Demand, it gives me an error message stating, ""Try again later,"" or it would say to reboot my receiver. Most times, I would have to reboot multiple times. Comcast has got to do something about this. Here I am again sitting here already 4 hours without service and I was told it would probably be another 4 hours until it's fixed."
"Sandra  of Pittsburgh, PA",5/31/2013,,I have wasted so much time and still don't have my problem solved. A level one agent in Pittsburgh caused me more problems and more headaches because of his poor skills. I am so frustrated I can't even tell you. This is the worst company ever!!!
"George of Huntsville, Al., AL",5/31/2013,,"I am bombarded on a near weekly basis with offers to switch or sign up for Comcast Xfinity. I have asked them to stop bothering me because my previous experience with this company demonstrated a VERY low level of honesty, integrity, and competence. I want them to remove me from their mailing list and LEAVE ME ALONE!!"
"Tina of Springfield, TN",6/2/2013,,"After many, many, many hours on the phone with Comcast and 4 appointments for service calls and one ""bucket truck tech"" who came out and fixed my down internet but refused to tell me what was wrong, saying, ""I am not at liberty to tell you what I fixed"" and whom Comcast says they have NO RECORD of coming out (?!), my internet is down again. It was suggested today that because I have economy internet - even though it worked perfectly for 6 months that now no longer works - well, it's economy! So this service tech did not even come out. This is 3 weeks of internet that does not work for many hours a day. It is obvious that they want me to take a more expensive internet service or they will continue shutting me down."
"A of Richmond, VA",6/3/2013,,"We had Comcast for both TV and internet. When we signed up for internet originally, we began to have a few problems connecting so we called and were told that they couldn't help us. We'd have to purchase their signature support for a $45 down payment and $5 a month. We did it, but only until we moved. Strangely enough, we never had any further problem after we signed up for the support plan. Recently, we ended the TV part of our plan because we weren't getting the channels included in our plan, and were lied to by Comcast multiple times. They told us they'd recently dropped those channels. The last couple of days, our internet has been going in and out. When I called, they determined that the problem was with the line and not my modem. They scheduled an appointment for a technician to come out and fix it, but then tried to transfer me to their signature support people to sell me the support plan again. What this tells me is that they lost the cable income from me so they are trying to get more money through the support plan by messing with my internet connection, which is inaccessible during the day but not in the evening. Comcast employees will lie, keep you on hold for hours, and try everything to get extra charges coming in each month."
"Rick of Jacksonville, FL",6/4/2013,,"So the previous tenant moved out and scheduled service disconnect on the 4th. I called on the fourth and got transferred around because the old account was still active. The operator told me he can still connect my service because the old one is scheduled to be disconnected the same day. Anyways, he went through his spiel about the packages. I told him no, I don't want a contract or a package; I want the cheapest TV and internet month to month. He then kept bringing up the packages. I told him no. He then brought up the packages again. I told him that I want the cheapest, cheapest service, and he told me the Digital Preferred is the cheapest. I know heâ€™s lying so I told him I will call back after I look up the services online. The cheapest TV is Limited Basic and $25 a month, and I choose Performance Starter at 6 MB for $50 a month. I called back and the operator told me he â€œcannot activate servicesâ€ because even though the previous tenantâ€™s scheduled disconnection was today, Comcast was not actually going to come out and disconnect the service till the 26th... and that I would have to go to the nearest Comcast service building to get them to change the disconnect date. How what???"
"Patrick of Baltimore, MD",6/9/2013,,"My first 24h as a Comcast customer:I called the local representative, on the advice of the building I am renting from, where I received the guarantee that I had the best deal. He charged me a price higher than what was available online and set up a connection inferior to the one I paid for, as well as was slow and discourteous in his communications. I first contacted Comcast's live chat to address this. The person was unhelpful, rude and terminated the chat, not wanting to change anything even though I didn't even get the plan I paid for. I then contacted Comcast on the phone. The 2nd person I spoke with finally fixed these 2 issues, but sent me to tech support because my speed tests were not up to what I had paid for. Finally, this issue was resolved by tech support. The day goes by, I noticed significant problems trying to stream video content at a high resolution, with a high amount of stuttering - a problem I didn't have at my previous ISP. I look things up and indeed the content was being throttled by Comcast: (a) their support forums discussed extensively how this was a recurring issue for streaming with Comcast; (b) this problem was independent on my hardware as I previously had no issues and the remainder of the internet worked; (c) my girlfriend, who still had the previous ISP, had no problems; and (d) the problem resolved through the use of a VPN that prevented Comcast from monitoring traffic. I spent 2 hours on the phone speaking with 5 different people to resolve this issue. Most people did not understand what I was talking, as they weren't particularly tech savvy despite being technical support. The last person that I spoke to about this became very quiet very suddenly when confronted with the evidence. Frequently, tech support would try to get me to sign up to a signature Comcast tech support that charged over $30 just to sign up, in addition to a $5-6 monthly fee, which is ludicrous and infuriating. It is interesting to note the FCC fined Comcast for throttling their customers' internet only within the last few years.So in summary, in 24h, Comcast's employees were dishonest about their offers, bait and switched my service, were rude and unhelpful when I tried to address them, made things extensively difficult to resolve and then tried to not only cover a blatantly illegal practice, but tried to again engage in dubious behavior to charge me for a service I don't need."
"Marcus of San Francisco, CA",6/10/2013,,"I have been paying $140 a month for a bundle service. The internet is supposed to be at 50 mbps. I run an average of 2-5 mbps since having the service. I don't have time to be dealing with this, but have still followed the technician's advice of changing out the modem and setting up an appointment for a visit. On the phone, Comcast claims that the only evidence of my internet not working is based on call logs of me calling in. The billing individual said that I was lying and that the problem pre-existed any phone calls I have made to Comcast. I tried explaining I don't have the time to deal with these problems... considering yesterday and today alone I have spent over 6 hours dealing with the problem that remains unresolved. The evidence I have been paying for service I don't receive lies in the fact I have to have someone come out here to troubleshoot a more fundamental problem with my service, not in the phone call log. All I ask is that I am reimbursed for services paid for but not received, but Comcast refuses. There are few choices in terms of switching service and I need internet for my work. There must exist a remedy for this problem."
"Kimberlie of Cape Coral, FL",6/12/2013,,"I will keep this short and sweet. We have had Comcast for 14 months. We have had 17 service calls, 3 within the past 2 days and my service is still not working correctly. They raised my rates after a year and still cannot fix the problem."
"George of Spring, TX",6/13/2013,,"I chose Comcast/Xfinity to be our DSL and alarm provider, but their actions were not professional from the beginning. We were given a few credits by their corporate office for several no shows, in which one caused us to miss the delivery of important information for our uncle's funeral. The installation person would say that he would be at our house at a certain time, but he did not show up or give a courtesy call. This would jeopardize our work schedule because most of the appointments were on a weekday.Comcast/Xfinity finally installed the equipment, but the billing credits had not been posted and the balance represented the wrong promotional rates. This caused the bill to be incorrect; it continued to be incorrect throughout the months of service. I have made many requests for them to produce a correct bill. Here is a list of problems that I have attempted to resolve with Comcast/Xfinity: This is the message that I receive as I access the Comcast.net portal to check and control things in my house, while out of town: ""Page Error; your account has been suspended. Please contact your service provider to resolve the situation.""My bill has been incorrect since February 2013. Although I have made every attempt to get a bill that shows the correct amount, I continue to see the wrong amount. Internet speed is supposed to have been the fastest, but it seemed sometime slower than my regular AT&T internet speed.Although I had my alarm checked more than once, I still experience the same problems. Four times this past month, I have come home and entered my code to disarm my home alarm. The alarm continues to beep after I have entered the code several times, until the siren finally sound off. Tanisha ** (Executive Customer Relations Houston Region) sent someone out to check this problem. He diagnosed the problem as the code being entered too fast. If I enter the code and one digit does not respond, I will not get another chance to re-enter the code and disarm the alarm. This will eventually lead to the alarm siren sounding. If my alarm constantly triggers, my neighbors will soon ignore it and that leaves opportunity for a real burglary to occur unnoticed. Another problem is the complaints of my alarm going off early in the morning and in our quiet neighborhood; it is disturbing my neighbors. I did not have this problem with my old alarm system!My email system no longer keeps track of when someone enters or leave my house.I could not monitor or control features in my house for weeks all because of reasons mentioned. I made several requests for Mrs. ** to give me the service that I paid for or cancel my contract. Without any attempt to resolve the problems and give adequate service, she immediately canceled my service the same day. I believe this decision was made to avoid giving the credits that were supposed to post to my billing account. I also believe that her decision was an attempt to avoid honoring the very low promotional rate that was offered in the beginning. When I spoke to her the same day that she disconnected my service, she told me that I would not receive a refund for the poor service received the entire time of service. She also made sure to inform me that by taking this matter up with corporate CEO (Brian Roberts), it will only trickle back down to her.I sent Mrs. ** a final email as an attempt to get her to correct the problems. I told her that I'd really rather have this situation resolved and allow them an opportunity to give better service. She told me that my service had already been cancelled and it would cost me installation fees again. She also informed me that the special promotional rates would not be available. This definitely demonstrates how unethical and unscrupulous Comcast/Xfinity is to their customer. To lure a customer in with promotions and not give the service that is expected, but cancel the customer's account instead of attempting to resolve the problems is just ludicrous and immoral.I am requesting that my full service be restored along with the same promotions that were tied to the account; I also need all issues and concerns resolved: I need my bill to reflect the proper amount online moving forward. I need the keypad that does not properly work replaced with one that does work. I need to be able to control and monitor my system online without error. I need your system to do everything that Comcast/Xfinity advertised it to do. I need my high speed internet to reach the speed advertised in the promotion.My house that was monitored under Central Security is unmonitored and can be broken in at any time. If service cannot be restored, I would like a full refund of any amount paid to Comcast/Xfinity!"
"Tj of Grosse Ile, MI",6/14/2013,,"After subscribing to Triple Play Services, I have had nothing but negative experiences with Comcast. The problem is that the company has grown into the largest cable provider in the world and its customer service has suffered. I attempted to use their self-install option, but after numerous calls, it was determined that I did not have service into my home. This was after several Comcast representatives assured me that I had service into the home. I scheduled an appointment for Saturday, but Comcast arrived on Friday morning instead. The technician left a note stating, ""No In-feed, requires Professional Installation.""After calling customer service and speaking to four different representatives, I was advised that it would be a minimum charge of over $200.00 for professional installation. I now have an appointment for Sunday, but I will be returning their equipment to their technician and stopping my scheduled service. For some reason, these companies do not value the time of their customers, and for this reason alone, I will seek a better option."
"Richard of Crosby, TX",6/15/2013,,"After switching from DirecTV to Comcast to save with the bundle package, the nightmare began quickly. After having trouble hooking up an HD box in the room, I spent 90 minutes with tech support assuring me each time ""this will work."" Finally, she said a tech will come out. He claimed all he did was use the HDMI2 output, which I did a number of times with tech support. Then he claimed the volume was messing up because the TV was old and should be replaced. I, like a dumb **, bought a new TV. And yes, the same problem occurred. In 1 month, the cable, phone and internet were out 9 times. The last being 12 hours. Had enough because they couldn't tell me why. Just that they knew the outage was in my area. I went back to DirecTV. My bill of $571 for one month came in and I was now livid. Numerous calls and no progress. Finally told they would take a large portion off my bill but didn't happen. Finally, they cut my phone and internet which I kept. Called them and told my story for the umpteenth time and told them just as they record me, I was recording this call. She talked to a supervisor and within 3 minutes, my services were restored with the promise that my bill would be fixed within 24 hours. Been 2 weeks and the bill has not changed. DIRECTV WOULD NEVER ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN TO A CUSTOMER!"
"juliana of Minneapolis, MN",6/16/2013,,"I have been dealing with interrupted service for the last month. Let me explain. First off, it started with pixelated picture, then the sound kept cutting in and out, and then the picture starts cutting in and out. I called my neighbor, had Comcast come out three times and it never got fixed. So I called about a dozen times and almost used up all my minutes on my phone and chatted with them online. All they told me is just to disconnect the cable box and connect it and the problem should be fixed. I called again saying that it is still doing the same thing. They told me that they will charge me $35 for having them to come out and look at my cable box or I can go in and get a new one. So I took the easy way. I went and got a new one and hope that works. I hooked up the new cable box and as soon as I hooked it up, I still get the problem. So I called again and they said that it is my fault. So I took my camera and I video-recorded the problem. I went outside and asked my neighbor if I can get a picture of the cable. So I did that and I went back to Comcast and showed them. They told me since my block does not have an alley, they cannot do anything. And I pay way too much for Comcast."
"Janet of Paradise, CA",6/17/2013,,"After three live chats and then two phone calls, still I have no resolution. They wanted to sell me something and then switch me to another agent to charge me for something that Xfinity should be taking care of. I am trying to access my email on my desktop and it keeps coming up access denied. It was fine a week ago. I am ready to go to another service provider. This is so frustrating. NO HELP!"
"Alex of Lake Worth, FL",6/18/2013,,"My horrible experience with Comcast started a few weeks ago. My boss and I were working late one evening when we noticed that neither one of us could send emails with attachments from any of our multiple webmail accounts (it is worth mentioning that my boss and I work out of his house). This problem forced us to call it quits. The next morning, I find out that after I left the previous evening, my boss spent several hours on the phone with Comcast and did not get the issue resolved. It is then my turn to call Comcast and after talking with several support advisors for hours, including a manager, I got nowhere. After wasting my entire morning, I finally spoke with someone who seems to know more/is more intelligent than the previous Comcast employees that I spoke with. I am told that the reason we are having internet problems is related to the fact that Comcast recently upgraded internet speeds in our area. Apparently, the modem we had (which was rented from Comcast) was not allowing us to access the higher speeds and according to the support person was the root of our problems. I was told that we needed a new modem and that Comcast could send one to us in 3-5 days. Since my boss and I work out of his house, we couldn't wait that long and I went to Best Buy immediately and bought an appropriate modem. It is worth noting that Comcast never sent out a notice in the mail explaining the internet speed increase and the fact that existing equipment might need to be upgraded in order to gain access to the faster speeds.After I installed the new modem and registered it with Comcast, the problem continued. I called a friend who works in the IT industry and he told me to run a speed test. After doing this, I learned that the download speed on the internet is fine but the upload speed is very poor and is the reason we are having problems sending emails with attachments. Again I called up Comcast and after a long conversation, I was told to contact a special technical support department in order to get the problem resolved. I spoke with a manager in this department who explained to me that the problem is on our end with the new modem and can be fixed, but they were going to charge us 50 some odd dollars to do so. At this point, I was fuming mad and told the manager that this was unacceptable. The conversation went nowhere and hang up. I called the regular Comcast support again, and after more time wasting, it is determined that the best course of action is to have a technician to come to my bossâ€™s house.The technician went 3 days later. At some point in days before the appointment, the download speed issue had somehow been fixed and everything was working fine. I could send emails with large attachments without any problems. The technician looked over all the components and checked the cables, and everything was working great.Fast forward a week and one morning, the internet goes from connected to unconnected every few minutes and eventually stays unconnected. I call Comcast again and spend my entire morning trying to have someone help me figure out whatâ€™s going on. I tell the Comcast person my experience from the previous week and they decide the best course of action is to send out a technician to the house again. The Comcast person I spoke with tells me that they also want to send a different technician to check the cables and components at the street level. However, based on the schedule, the earliest they can send that technician out is in 4 WEEKS!! I find this totally unacceptable and am told that this is the best they can do.A day or so later, my boss speaks with a neighbor down the street who has been experiencing the similar problems with their Comcast internet. The house technician shows up two days after this and we are finally told the truth. THE ENTIRE STREET AND NEIGHBORING STREETS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS!! The fact that my boss and I wasted a total of 3 working days trying to figure out what was going on with the internet was very upsetting. The worst part of this experience was Comcast repeatedly telling us that the internet issues we were experiencing were on our end of things. They were not being truthful with the fact that we were one of many in the area that were experiencing the same issues, meaning that the problems were in fact on their end. We still donâ€™t know what the exact reason/cause is for the internet issues because the street level technician wonâ€™t show up for another few weeks. As far as we know, issues with the internet could still occur at any time. We are currently looking into other internet providers in hopes that we find one that is reliable."
"Jim of Maple Grove, MN",6/18/2013,,"I ended up ordering a new Comcast internet service back on May 1, 2013. I had moved to a new address and previously had Qwest/Centurylink internet service for the past 7 years with no issues I can recall. Unfortunately, since this is a new development, I couldn't transfer my Centurylink service to the new address because they haven't completed running wires to my location yet.First, it was technical issues with Comcast not being able to provision my own cable modem. Although my cable modem was on their supported list, they had many problems getting it provisioned. It took no fewer than 15 calls to their technical support and required me to actually replace 2 perfectly functional cable modems at my time and expense. It took from May 1 until June 14 and 30+ hours of tech support time to finally get connected without some sort of issue.What I will say is that Comcast has a fundamentally broken tech support system which costs them huge in overall customer satisfaction and $$$. At some point you're going to have to call their technical support line if you have an issue. The first person you actually speak with typically is not very technically knowledgeable. I have personally worked in a technical field all my career (25+ years) and can immediately tell if I'm talking to someone who knows something or not. It also depends on the time of day you are calling. If your issue is not something they've dealt with many times in the past, you're in trouble.One of the Comcast tricks I've personally had done to me on at least 3 of my calls into their support line is if the person you're talking to can't solve your problem, they start putting you on hold for very long periods of time. During this time, I have no clue what they are doing, but what happens is that eventually they either just hang up on you or you unknowingly get transferred to someone else in tech support who has no clue what or who you've been talking to for the past 40+ minutes. You have to start completely from scratch!The other neat trick is that the tech support person tries to sell you more services. In my case, the tech support person thought I should have the Comcast Phone package. Although I very clearly stated I was not interested, it didn't matter, the person still went ahead and put in an order for phone service and told me nothing about this. Then, they transferred me to someone else to continue working the issue which they could not resolve! This later caused me huge issues because I had to make more calls to other people at Comcast to cancel the phone service I didn't order or want. They told me that because I was now downgrading my service, I could no longer have the special pricing plan I was originally offered for internet service only. They were also billing me for unrelated things I should not have been billed for. After this, I completely blew up and told them to just cancel the service. What happens then is you get transferred to someone else who really can fix it and put things back. But it needs to come to that in order to get to someone. So this has been my experience with Comcast during my first 7+ weeks. At my earliest opportunity, I'm planning to get rid of Comcast and go with virtually any other option I can find or just not have internet service as it's just not worth the trouble!!!"
"Chloe of Saint Paul, MN",6/19/2013,,"Comcast (now called Xfinity) is the worst internet service in the planet! Overcharging the service fee without customer noticing! I was charged with both basic cable service and internet for about $71 ($51.95/month for internet, $9 for cable, and other miscellaneous fees)! When I called to cancel the cable service, the representative told me that according to the policy, I should pay $64 alone for the internet if I cancel the cable!! I said the price listed online is just $51.95/month (THERE IS NO SAYING THE PRICE IS FOR NEW CUSTOMER OR IS A DISCOUNT). He kept telling me I was receiving discount for that price. I asked him to show me where I could find the policy either in paper or on the website. He was not able to give me the answer but promised to transfer my call to ""canceling department"". I was waiting on the phone but the call was just hung up by the representative! I tried a few more times and received the same result over and over again! They just don't want to solve any problem for customers! Worst company and poor customer service!"
"Shirley of Parker, CO",6/21/2013,,"I recently signed up for Comcast bundled services. There were so many errors on our bill, beginning with the packages they were advertising at the time. We received our bill and it was a completely different package, charges for install, misc fees. I don't know what to make of it. I called numerous times to clear it up. Poor customer service. Do consumers have any rights at all? We have very little to choose from here; it's either satellite (DirecTV) or Comcast."
"John of Atco, NJ",6/22/2013,,"I'll try to keep it summarized. The appointment was made to upgrade service and add a new TV to an existing Comcast service. Initially, it was pleasant on the phone while we were making these improvements to our system. It went all downhill from there. The appointment was from 11 to 1. My wife came home from work at 11, with plans to leave about 3pm for another activity. I called Comcast at 11am to see how the installer was running with the appointment time. They said, ""No problem."" At 1 pm, they called to let us know that the installer would be there no later than 2:30 (and never called after that). Now, my wife is fuming because of missed work and now having to postpone her 3:30 activity. At 3, I left work early to come home so she can leave. Again (about 3:30), I called Comcast about the appointment. They couldn't tell me anything besides, ""We can reschedule for another day that is more convenient for you."" Now both my wife and I have lost work time waiting for them, and they want us to do it again??? The final answer they gave was that he was on the road and to give him 15 minutes or so. An hour and 1/2 later, I called again (now after 5pm). This time, they couldn't tell me anything at all about the time that the technician might show up. They offered a $20 credit for my inconvenience. In my mind, that was an insult. A free months service would at least make me feel better. I wanted to talk to someone in charge, and after several minutes holding, I was told that the supervisor was busy and couldn't talk to me. I had been nice up to this point. I told them to cancel the upgrades and additional TV, and I would look for another service provider so I could never have to deal with Comcast again. The girl apologized and canceled everything. It gets betterâ€¦So now, I go back to work for a few more hours. My wife comes home from her activity at about 6 pm. I called her on the way home, about 8:30, and she tells me the guy is there installing the equipment. Ugh. So I wanted to rush home and kick him out, but the drive home calmed me down. By the time I get home, he has most of the install done. Iâ€™ll skip to after he leaves at 9pm. My son goes to the basement to watch the new TV that he connected. It powers on and then the box dies, and it won't come back on. He went upstairs to check on the bedroom box and noticed the 8-year old remote that has buttons that don't work (one of the reasons we wanted new boxes) was not replaced, so we can only go up channels (down button broken). The family room remote wasn't new either. I called Comcast to complain, and they want to schedule a technician 5 days later during the day!!! There's no way I'm waiting around all day again. So at some point when I have the time, I have to disconnect the equipment and grab the remote controls, drive 25 minutes to the nearest Comcast office and request replacement products. Meanwhile, I have a new TV in the basement that we cannot use. I am disgusted with Comcast. I will be looking for a better service provider. They better not try to hold me to the 24 month agreement of theirs! I will say that the customer reps were pleasant (not nasty), but they couldn't give us any answers. Imagine having an 11:00 appointment at the dentist office, and after waiting until after 5pm, you are told that you'll need to keep waiting because the dentist isn't sure when he'll be done with his previous patient. This would have all been easier to handle if they had told us that the technician could show up any time between 11 and 7 (ridiculous, but at least we'd be prepared)."
"Brad of Jensen Beach, FL",6/23/2013,,"I have relied on Comcast's services for both my home and office. I can't use the internet at either. This has been going on today and yesterday. I have contacts that need to go out and I can't send them due to outages. This is costing me thousands of dollars and could be detrimental to my business. We also have payroll that we rely on intranet connection to complete. If the problem isn't resolved soon, people will go without paychecks tomorrow."
"Anne Marie of Peckville, PA",6/23/2013,,"I have had a Comcast account for a year. I have standard cable, as well as internet service. In a year, my bill has gone from $100 a month to $129.14 a month to $164.47 a month. I have not added any channels or any services. Why does this cable company continue to operate which such impunity, while consumers are not given any options?"
"Charles of Jacksonville, FL",6/24/2013,,"On any given day, I would easily achieve speeds between 16.00/25.00. In the beginning, I rented Comcast's WiFi Router combo, but it was a P.O.S. as well, so I returned it and purchased a separate router & modem (I've read it's a preferred option); speeds seem to be far better than previously. However, as of last week, the same problem started once again. I've been experiencing slow to ridiculously slow internet speeds, mostly in the evenings and between the hours of 4PM - 8PM. Download speeds were between 0.44/1.08 & Upload unaffected, and steady between 4.00/5.00. The worst was last night. I purchased an HD movie from iTunes and usually it would begin 1-2 min. after purchase. This time, I was getting a message on screen advising a time movie would be ready to view, as it was ""loading"" and it jumped from 1 hr. 36 min to as high as 3 hours!. After 45 min., and a reset of modem, movie began to play. I stopped calling Comcast Customer Service. It's pointless since they always assume it's on the customer's end, and they do the usual system checks and ask you to turn off modem and restart. B.S., I tell you. I believe they are doing something to slow the speeds down during these times, but what can the consumer do? My only other option is AT&T, but only DSL is available, and why should I switch? If I'm paying for high speed service with Comcast, I should expect top speeds no matter what time of day it may be. Frustrating, I tell."
"Nichelle of Frederick, MD",6/24/2013,,"We just moved into our new apartment and, with a strong reluctance to order from Comcast, we had to anyway because of the monopoly of cable companies. It was either Comcast or Verizon DirecTV, and satellite dishes I despise. So we ordered three boxes and internet and chose the option to install ourselves for free to avoid the headache and aggravation of an appointment. After I installed all devices, I used to the internet to activate them to avoid again any further headache or aggravation from their customer service. Only two were activated and it instructed me to call customer service. After speaking to about 8 customer reps and 12 transfers to various departments, they informed us that there was an outstanding bill from about 4 years ago and only one box was allowed on our account. So they deactivated the other two boxes!!!!! We don't even know what they are talking about and it's so aggravating. If that's the case, why wasn't this disclosed in the very beginning?!!!!! Then we have to wait until the next day to speak with the department who handles this type of situation. I so wish I can cancel but they are the only cable provider in Frederick, MD!!!! I hate Comcast so much with a passion."
"Edward of Grand Rapids, MI",6/25/2013,,"Recently, I went into the local Comcast office to ask a question about my service. I drove to this location, because it is 3 miles from my home and because it takes less time to drive there and stand in line than it does to wait for a representative to answer the phone. The woman I spoke with looked up my account and before she even addressed my question told me that I had been receiving channels that I was not entitled to and that my monthly rate was going to be raised by $40 effective immediately! I literally stood there with my mouth open for a couple of seconds wondering if it was some sort of prank. Unfortunately, it wasn't. When I explained that the channel package that I currently had was one that I purchased from Comcast several years before, her response was ""We've gone digital, so we can now track our customers better."" I felt like a criminal! The next words out of her mouth were ""Can I help you with anything else?"" She finally relented and said that she would only raise my bill by $10 a month for 6 months but at that point, it would be bumped up to the full $40. I think her attitude was as aggravating as the rate increase. She was totally indifferent to my concerns and sat with a smirk on her face the entire time. I am going to buy a smart television and begin streaming videos and get an antenna for local stations. AT&T and Comcast are monopolies and they act like it because they can. There is no such thing as customer satisfaction in their corporate vocabularies and there certainly is no oversight of their business practices."
"William of Fair Oaks, CA",6/26/2013,,My call dropped at least 10 times in 2 days. All operators refused to allow me to talk to a supervisor. They said they would make corrections to my bill and never did. They transferred me to other departments and individuals without telling me. Operator scripting prevented an intelligent scripting. I had to pay off a bill even though they had more than enough money in a closed account that I wanted them to apply.
"Kent of Appling, GA",6/26/2013,,"I have had substandard cable TV service for months. I called several times and had to hang up before ever talking to a representative because of the wait time. After finally getting to talk with several people in various countries and states, I had, over a period of a week, received four appointments for a tech to come to our house. I was stood up three times. (Comcast will dispute this because the techs reported that they came, but they lied and did not!) There seems to be no or little accountability with their techs (usually contractors). None of the techs that supposedly came to our home came to our door, called, or left a note on our property saying that they had been here. One time I was given SEVEN HOUR WINDOW for a service call (and no one showed up).Today's call was related to my bill. A Comcast representative gave me an adjusted total amount to pay last month's bill of $143.20. Now they say I owe an additional $84.20. My new increased bill has been around $178 per month total. It was increased to this amount because their rep says that my ""promotional"" ended. When I started this account, I remember asking for a rate that would not change. At that time my monthly bill was around $143.Today, they are telling me that my monthly bill will be about $190 plus taxes and fees, which will make my bill exceed $212 (or as my statement says, $234.92). It seems that every time I talk with a Comcast rep that my monthly bill increases. I am not adding any services! All I want is that I get the services that we agreed on at the prices that I was quoted. Is it too much to ask that the services work fully that I am paying for each month?I am livid! The worst thing is that there seems to be absolutely NOTHING that I can do, other than drop my service. If I refuse to pay the outrageous bill that they say I owe, then Comcast will turn me over to collections and ruin my credit over their incompetence. I want their ways exposed publicly. I have talked with many people that also get no resolve to their issues with Comcast. Can someone help expose their poor customer service practices?"
"William of San Carlos, CA",6/27/2013,,"I was going to cancel my service and they talked me into staying on with a faster internet service and a new modem. Of course, when I got the new modem, it worked on the landline but the wireless portion did not work. Yes, I know it is cap sensitive and a million charters. When I called in to the little brochure, they slipped in the package it was for signature support services. They wanted to charge me for the support of something they just sent me that did not work. I said that was silly and she said this was the only department that could help with wireless... I hung up with her and called back in, getting cut off two times and spending over 3 hours of my time. I believe the issue is finally fixed now but that remains to be seen. The last service person was great... The three people I spoke with before her were very bad and did not follow through or help me with my problem. I want to switch to Dish or DirecTV now very badly..."
"BOB of Norwood, MA",6/27/2013,,"Came off seasonal disconnect on May 1. I visited the house on June 8 and found all COMCAST service dead as a door nail. Comcast box in basement had no lights. I arranged for tech to come out on June 13. Tech spent 2.5 hrs and fixed everything including a new interface box in the basement. I contacted customer service on June 17. They told me because of seasonal disconnect, they would give me a credit of $256. Asked if I should pay the current bill, they said, ""Wait till you get the credit."" NO credit on the bill. I called and they said, ""There is no indication from the last rep that you would be getting a $256 credit."" I spoke to a supervisor and all he could belch up was scripted garbage. He did not even know what CRM was!! He did not even know the rep who authorized the $256!! I asked for his supervisor to call me back... ""They're all at a meeting. I will send them an email,"" he said. More garbage... what do you believe no one will call me back!!!"
"Carter of Warren, OH",6/27/2013,,"I took out TV and internet service with Comcast in January 2013 at my Florida location. I explained it would be temporary and paid the full rate (no discounts for contract duration) for the service. On 3/27/13, I returned their equipment to their Leesburg, FL service office, expecting to get a refund for unused time and returning the equipment. To date, I have received a check for $21.07 from a total of $66.07. When I contacted them about the remaining $45.00, I discovered they were keeping that because I supposedly failed to return their equipment.When I returned the equipment to the Leesburg office on 3/27/13, I asked the lady on duty if I could get a receipt showing that I returned the equipment. She informed me that all of the equipment had serial numbers and they would identify when it was returned by the numbers. A couple of weeks after I returned to Ohio, I received a call from a Comcast rep asking when I would return the equipment. I explained that I had and what I was told in the Leesburg office. She assured me she would take care of the issue. Since then it has gone downhill. I used chat (more than once) to discuss the problem. Finally, I had a chat on 5/10/13 with one Melani, who assured me I would receive a check in 3 to 4 weeks. To date, I have not received the $45.00 they owe me. THIS IS RIDICULOUS! I did what I was asked and I feel as though I am being treated as a liar or just flat being ignored. I returned their equipment on 3/27/2013. It is now 6/27/13. I think there has been more than sufficient time to return my refund. If I owed them money, would they wait three months to get it?I want someone to contact them about this issue and, if possible, their ratings to be negatively affected because of it. If you are not the agency to do so, please advise with whom I should file this complaint that will take some kind of action with Comcast."
"Karma of Bryant, AR",7/2/2013,,"I called to get internet and cable services in April 2013. I paid for the first month's bill, equipment, and shipping for all of the equipment on the date I ordered the service. The equipment received was short three adapter boxes (although we received the additional remotes). I called back and they shipped the adapter boxes immediately. All three tiny boxes came in the same package. A shipping charge of $29.85 ($9.95 per adapter) was applied to my account for these adapter boxes (that should have been included in the original box and original shipping charges). I have contacted Customer Service three times since receiving this charge (once in May, twice in June, and now finally today is the fourth time). Each time, the representative agreed that I should not be charged and that a credit would be applied.The third call was on 6/20/13 at 12:12 pm. Allen, employee number **, informed me that the credit of $29.85 to my bill for shipping fees that should not have been charged was still being reviewed by a supervisor. I explained that I had been told this twice in the past month and asked to speak to a supervisor. He placed me on hold and upon his return said that all supervisors were busy but he was able to discuss this matter with an account specialist. He said that what he could do for me is to go ahead and apply the credit to my account (and was doing so while we were on the phone together). He explained to me that the past reps had only submitted the credit to a supervisor. He assured me that the credit would show on my next bill and that I would not have any service interruptions due to this $29.85 charge.It is 7/02/2013. I had to contact customer service again because they shut my service off due to the ""past due"" amount of $29.85. I went to pay the bill online (which I always pay on the 2nd of the month) but was not allowed to submit it unless I included the $29.85. I paid the full amount. I contacted an account rep through online chat to discuss the credit I am due. Joancien typed, ""I have fully applied the $28.95 shipping fee credits on the account. The services are now also restored since the past due amount has been credited."" She also stated, ""The previous credits quoted by our previous reps were not posted on the account since the previous reps only submitted the credit request to a supervisor but the credits were not applied.""Service was restored so let's hope that it is due to her issuing the credit and not because I paid the bill. I hope it does not show up on the next bill, which I am afraid that it will. In addition to this, the internet service does not work without completing a reset every time (and then sometimes it still doesn't work). A technician has looked at it and ""repaired the problem"" but it still fails. I have also spent countless hours on the phone with Support over this issue. Keep in mind, I have only had the service since the middle part of April 2013 and it is now July 2, 2013.Needless to say, I have spent so much of my time devoted to trying to get at least decent service from Comcast. All in all, they have poor equipment and very poor customer service. Sadly, unless I want to go with satellite service, Comcast is my only option."
"stephen of Hallandale, FL",7/2/2013,,"Comcast rep went into a gated backyard, opened the gate, and let the dogs run out. Broke a panel on gate to open it. I found him in the backyard and asked why he would go back there without permission. His answer was he didn't need it. I asked for his supervisor's name. He said, ""I'll get it"" and then gave me a Comcast brochure... for sales. Police said because they have an easement, they are granted the right to enter at anytime.So he caused damage and I have a 15-year-old that goes back there to sunbathe and swim. So now I have to worry about Comcast subcontractors wandering around at their whim. They come a lot. I don't even use Comcast... but their box is at the end of my yard. I was told by the PD that if I lock the gate, they even have the right to cut the locks in South FL."
"William of Bentonville, AR",7/6/2013,,"We had Comcast a decade ago. It was a nightmare trying to get them to stop charging us after we cancelled the service and returned the equipment. They even tried to charge us for the equipment after we had returned it. Thankfully, we kept the receipt handy and had to send copies several times to get them to stop charging us for it. Now we are having the same issue. I was told that they were much better these days, but again they are charging us for services after we had cancelled. They claim they did not receive the call in April 2013 when I cancelled the service. They are still playing their stupid games of pleading ignorance. They need to be sued. There are enough complaints for a class action against Comcast."
"D of San Leandro, CA",7/8/2013,,"Comcast, Shame on you. Be proud enough of your organization to answer the phone in the USA. My Internet was out for several days. Every Comcast phone number I could find connected me to either Singapore or Korea. All those reps could do is read me scripts asking me to fuss around with the cable TV connection to my modem & reboot. One idiot ran a ""remote diagnostics"" test, and swore I had a blown modem. He insisted that I take the modem to the nearest Comcast retail store, and stand in a 1-2 hour line to exchange the device.After insisting on speaking to a US operator (and getting hung up on 3 times), I was finally connected to their Denver office. A supervisor there confirmed that there was a network equipment node outage on their end in Fresno, CA on 07-05-13, which affected my service, even though my service address is more than 250 miles away. The foreign CS reps are not provided with accurate or timely information concerning service outages, and are just there to frustrate customers."
"Mason of Monessen, PA",7/10/2013,,"On June 23rd, 2013, my services were interrupted for past due balance on my account. Something came up previously and I was forced to skip a bill. I had every intention to get caught up. However, when I called Comcast, I was unable to pay with a postdated check because it was a Sunday and billing dept. was closed. The gentleman restored service as I promised to call and set up payment on the next business day. I called on Monday, June 24th, 2013 and scheduled to have $205.00 (past due balance) debited from my checking account on June 28th, 2013. Friday came and went and on Wednesday, July 3rd, 2013, suddenly, my services were suspended, again. So I called Comcast again and demanded explanation. The woman working at the time assured me that no postdated check was ever taken and no notes were left in system. Now I am getting very frustrated. So now another woman says that she does not want to take a payment in case of postdated check going through. Next, she explains she will dig deeper into the situation and get back with me after the holiday weekend and resolve the issue. My services were restored once again. There was no phone call on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday on the new week after July 4th weekend. On Wednesday, July 10, 2013, my services are once again interrupted. I called once again and now the woman I am talking with is insisting that no previous attempts were made to resolve bill payment on my part and my (new) past due balance is $384.00. Now I am erupting with anger. After arguing with the billing dept., I am transferred to a supervisor. I explained my entire issue with her and she tells me that her hands are tied and there is nothing she can do. Meanwhile my cable is off and this could have been easily avoided if only an employee of Comcast would have simply done their jobs. I commit to a postdated payment of my (new) past due balance of $384.00. Now they are unable to help me because the system is only able to approve postdated payments 7 days in advance. I can only agree to 9 days which would end up being paid on Friday, July 19th, 2013. The supervisor again tells me there is nothing she can do until seven days before the payment. So now my family is out of cable for 2 days. I can handle it but to a two-year-old, they do not understand. ""Dad, why can't I watch TV? Was I bad?"" It's pure embarrassment to my family and shows a sign of weakness. Nobody looks up to that. Correct me if I am wrong but loyalty at one time went a long way in this world. I have been a customer of Comcast for over 5 years. Though they made a mistake, they cannot give me two days with a committed payment to restore my services? Something is wrong."
"Marcus of San Rafael, CA",7/11/2013,,"Back in May, Comcast announced, ""We just increased your Internet speed."" All that was required was that I have a modem with DOCSYS 3.0, so I purchased a new $100 Motorola modem with DOCSYS 3.0 and hooked it up. I called Comcast to activate the connection. Fine and dandy so far. However, according to the Comcast reps, we're supposed to be getting a minimum of 20 Mbps -- something we have NEVER experienced. We've been lucky to get as high as 1.2 Mbps on rare occasions; usually, we settle for 700 kbps. But then, in the middle of June, downloads dropped to a start of 500 kbps, and then, within 2-3 minutes, it dropped to 20 kbps, rarely completing any download.We've run numerous antivirus programs, Malwarebytes malware scrubber, CCleaner clutter cleaner, defragged hard drives, etc. ALL of these indicate that our PCs are squeaky clean. Ergo, the problem MUST be from Comcast's side. When I contacted Tech Support, they checked from their side and stated that we should be getting that minimum of 20 Mbps. Beyond that, a tech would need to be sent, and if the problem was ascertained to be non-Comcast, it would cost $50. OR, I could agree to pay $3.99 per month forever for the Service Protection Plan.This smacks of a Protection racket scam: sell something, drop the performance to generate the trouble call, then sell ""insurance"" to correct the problem, especially when the fine print reads, ""Restrictions apply. Not available in all areas. Speed increase affects Performance Internet customers. Actual speeds vary and are not guaranteed."""
"angie of Miami, FL",7/12/2013,,We've had so many issues with Comcast. They disconnected our internet service for no reason. They are so incompetent. Itâ€™s unfortunate they are such a monopoly.
"Jessica of Grand Rapids, MI",7/12/2013,,"Comcast is outrageous!! We wanted the security system. I tell you, it's not worth it at all!! Please be aware they want money. Well, what happened with us is ... they had someone else's security on our account; our bill was $400. We are supposed to do 3 months of $133. We got our bill and it's almost $600!! I called, ""Why is it high?"" She said that we had one more payment of $133 than two months worth which is about $250, $250 and $133; it is not $600... Do not get the security; they will make you broke!!!! Please be aware!!!"
"Kelly of Fort Lauderdale, FL",7/12/2013,,"I took several days off of work to travel to my daughter's apartment 100 miles away to coordinate service for internet and phone at my daughter's apartment. They kept not showing up, changing appointments and then just threw up their hands and said to return the equipment, which we did. When I returned the equipment, the Comcast employee verified that we never logged into the internet from this location. Now, I have over a $500 bill after returning the equipment. We never had service for one day and they are refusing to resolve this issue, saying I OWE THEM per the contract?!? In order to have a contract, you MUST provide a service, which they NEVER did!!!"
"Pamela of El Dorado Hills, CA",7/15/2013,,"Telephoned Comcast to order service on April 16, 2013. Informed Comcast that my move in date was May 1, 2013. A deposit was required and made to obtain a Bundle service. On May 4, 2013 received a bill asking for payment for one month. Telephoned Comcast and informed them that I had just moved in on May 1, 2013. Comcast informed me that statements commence on the date of order even though services are not provided. On May 1, 2013 a service representative came to my home to install services. While ordering phone, TV, and Internet, the installer only installed TV. Was informed that he had another appointment and had to leave. Leaving me high and dry.While the installer was at my home he broke a $300.00 figurine that was fifteen years old. Telephoned Comcast to advise of damage. A Comcast representative told me that a report would be written and the matter would be closed in three to five days. After three weeks, telephoned Comcast to ask for update on damage issue. At that time, the rep informed me that Comcast was not handling the matter and I should contact Liberty Mutual Insurance Company. Each time when telephoning Liberty Mutual the agent was nasty and refused to assist me.Finally after a four-week wait Liberty Mutual told me that their company was a third party and would not pay for any damage. Liberty Mutual was told that I DID NOT BREAK the figurine the installer did. Telephoned Comcast and reported the discussion with Liberty Mutual to the CEO office and was informed that an executive would contact me to resolve the matter. Three days later a representative - not an executive - telephoned me and told me that Comcast was not going to help me even though they did receive confirmation that the installer did own up to the breakage of my figurine. A week later a check in the amount of $110.00 was received with a take it or leave it statement. Deposited the check and immediately cancelled services with Comcast as I will not deal with such a dishonest company.How do you allow this Company to continue to do business? Comcast continually fabricates, increases payments without notification, does not adhere to agreed prices and denies or feigns no knowledge of what is told from one representative to another, and will not take ownership for what they do. Along with what occurred above Comcast billed for incorrect amounts and did NOT record payments paid. This all took place in a seven-week period!!!! This Company should NOT be allowed to continue to provide any type of so called service to the public. Thank you for allowing me to inform you of what takes place with Comcast."
"Janet of Elk Grove, CA",7/17/2013,,"I noticed that my Comcast bill was going up again! I have basic cable TV with performance (25 mbps) Internet service = the cheapest service possible. I called and asked if there was anything I could do to lower my cost. I am disabled and also 61 years old and live on a fixed income. I don't own a regular phone, but use a Tracfone, so no DSL service is possible yet. The agent told me I had the only package possible and should go to my nearest local Comcast office and see what they could do for me.I drove to the office a couple of days later with my modem in hand and asked about what they might be able to do for me. NOTHING. I was told there were no programs available for the disabled or low income people in the nation. He told me ""if you can't afford it, you can't have it."" I gave him my modem, and turned in my digital converter box the next day. I was put on a promotional plan of $49.99 a month for Internet service for 12 months while I look around for another provider. I feel insulted by Comcast. The company only thinks of raking in money and not the people it serves."
"AngryCat of Sammamish, WA",7/18/2013,,"I only have basic TV service. Comcast provided me with one box; this box only can get SD. If I want to watch HD I have to pay another $9.90/month, additional box $1.99/month. The fees piled up. I decided to cancel my TV service but they want to raise my internet service from $51.15 to $64.95. I will shop for another broadband service to get rid of Comcast. When the day comes I'll never look back."
"Lee of Houston, TX",7/18/2013,,"My business has been a customer for 3 years. We decided to print our invoices online, rather than paper. To get on the website and print a bill, you must first enter a ""security pin"" which they are supposed to send you. I requested one through their website three different times and never received one by email as promised. I called their customer service and they said they would send one by mail. It never arrived. I called back and they said they couldn't help because the ""security pin"" was issued by a ""black box"" system they had no control over and all they could do was order another one. It never arrived either. I called back and was transferred to a ""specialist"" who assured me one would be sent. Two weeks and it has not arrived either. Still cannot view my account online and considering just changing providers."
"Richard of Howell, MI",7/18/2013,,"Comcast caused several issues for us that I think people should know about. (Long Time Customer) 1.) We called Comcast to come out to install coax cable in our dining room and living room. When the technician finally arrived, the technician ran the coax cable in loops over the siding instead of cutting and fitting the coax so it is hidden. Some of the TVs won't work unless you wiggle the coax. We called them to come back out to fix the coax and they told us that they would have to charge us $4-500.00 to fix these issues. After several hours on hold and calls to Comcast, Comcast customer service told us they would send out a technician to take a look at these issues. We scheduled a date and time for the technician to come out. The technician never showed up nor received a call from the technician 3 TIMES! We are currently fixing all of their mistakes. Absolutely ridiculous!2.) Needed to add a TiVo to our plan - TOOK 10 HOURS TO GET MY TIVO'S CABLE CARD CONNECTED! 2 WEEKS, EVERY DAY! TOOK SEVERAL CALLS TO FIND SOMEONE THAT KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING! Got placed on hold for several hours, was told my cable card was broken (LIES). If Comcast technical team didn't want to deal with me, they would hang up, put me on hold, or tell me to wait for 1 hour for the channels to come through. If they didn't know what they were doing, they would tell me that they needed to go talk to their team to get the card connected. Then after 10 to 15 minutes, they would come back and tell me to wait one hour. I did this process 4 times!Finally, I talked to a technician that knew what she was doing and sent the signal to my cable card and got the channels to come in while I was on the phone within a few seconds! Then I called the next day to tell them my On Demand freezes up. 3 hours on the phone and talked to 2 different technicians and they told me my card is broken again because they don't feel like fixing the issue. My cable card is brand new! The card works great and there is nothing wrong with my card! I could not believe it!I gave up at this point. The On Demand still will not work to this day. This was truly the worst experience I ever had and never would recommend Comcast. Comcast customer service and their technical team have the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. They are rude, unknowledgeable, and extremely lazy. Comcast really has a lot of work to do. The faces of Comcast are making the entire company look bad and I don't think this is fair for the good staff of Comcast."
"W of Miami, FL",7/19/2013,,"Comcast essentially has a monopoly in our area, with all other choices being as bad as their services. I have felt overcharged, abused, and have been flat-out lied to about my services and billing. I can't wait for Comcast to go out of business forever."
"TONY of Olympia, WA",7/19/2013,,"On July 2, I contacted Comcast moving service. After a thirty-minute call the analyst transferred me to another person. This person would supposedly set up a service person to come to my slip and confirm services were available. This second call took another 30 minutes. I was issued a service ticket number and told to call back if I did not hear from the service person by the following Monday. No call from any Comcast employee. I called again and spoke with another analyst. This person could not comprehend that if there was service at B24, B10 and B3 there should be service at B7. This person told me, ""Sorry, I can't help you. Call the moving specialist (the number I called was to the moving service)."" I spent another 35 minutes on this call. I called the next number and was told that the analyst would check into the problem and that I should call back in one hour. This analyst sent me a link that would supposedly get me back to her so I would not have to explain the issue again. When I called the link I got another person who was clueless to what I was trying to accomplish. He transferred my call to yet another person who promised that by the next Wednesday, I would be contacted by a field service agent. No call on Wednesday. I called again and after going through the whole issue one more time, I was told I would be contacted by that Friday. No call. I called again and talked to another person who seemed to understand the issue. He could see that there was service on the dock. He gave me another ticket number and said that I would be contacted by this Thursday. No call again. So it has been 16 days and over five hours of my time trying to just get Comcast to transfer my service 100 yards from slip 43A to B7. How can I resolve this and get my service moved and be reimbursed for the days I was not provided service after my move request?"
"Flint of Conyers, GA",7/19/2013,,"Been a Comcast customer for a very long time and never really had any issues with them before now. On May 21st, 2013, I called Comcast about a problem with my modem after a bad storm that we had. I finally got that issue resolved after calling three different times and getting ""disconnected"" several times. The last person I spoke with asked me if I would like to upgrade my service since my initial double play bundle had expired and I was now being charged the ala carte price which is WAY higher than the bundled price. I said, ""Yes, I would like a package that is around $100 per month"". She told me that they were currently offering the triple play package for $99 per month so I decided to go with that even though I do not need a home phone. So, I thought everything was fine...got my first bill and actually had a credit from the difference in price. I was very happy with everything until my 2nd bill arrived 2 weeks ago. It seems they cancelled my triple play bundle and reverted me back to my old double play bundle without telling me. They also charged me TWICE! My bill for one month of service is $255. I have both bills on paper (thank god because I can't pull up my bill online). So, I called up Comcast and was ""disconnected"" (hung up on) 2 times and the third guy says a member of management will call me within 24 hours (not holding my breath - if someone calls I will be AMAZED).Comcast needs to have competition. They are the only high speed internet (cable) company available where I live. They are a monopoly that hires stooges from Asia to answer their phones and read from a script. I have to have high speed for my home business or I would dump them right now. I feel sorry for the good people who work there. My installer when I moved was AWESOME. My neighbor down the street works for them (super good guy). If they would just get people to answer the phones that were competent..."
"F of Ab, PA",7/20/2013,,"I had trouble with my internet after a rainstorm, which was a normal occurrence when it rained heavily. Comcast was able to send a tech the next day to fix the issue. They were awesome on that visit to fix the problem. The CSR offered me a land line service that would reduce my bill. Sounded great, but they would need to come out again. They came as expected, but I wasn't home to see what they did. When I came home not only did I not have a working land line but the internet also. After calling them and being on the phone for over an hour, it was resolved. I asked them if I could get a credit on the account and the phone tech support said they'd have to transfer me. Then I heard music & the call was dropped. Then I had to call back in and after waiting several more minutes the CSR said they could give me $1.40 credit and 3 months of a premium channel. I then said, why not an actual account credit like they advertise on TV with a late appointment, you get $20. They had to transfer me to a supervisor. After waiting several more minutes the supervisor said she could give me $25. I said that I would have accepted that before but the hold times should warrant more. Then they said I have to talk to a manager since I didn't think it was reasonable. Another long wait and a manager said, ""We'll offer $25 and that's it."" They said they don't pay for your time & one day service is what the issue was. Mind you, I was pretty upset at this point and after being lectured to, I said, ""Aren't you supposed to be trying to keep customers,"" and their reply was, ""We do but only will offer that credit."" After several more minutes they upped the offer to $30. Finally, I accepted and when I asked for something in writing, they said, ""No, take our word for it."" I then said, ""If the credit doesn't go through, then what should I do,"" and I was advised to call the 800 number. I repeated back to him what he said and he wouldn't confirm it.I understand things happen but the tech should have made sure everything worked before they left. Also the call support should learn how to talk to people & not talk down to them. Shame on Comcast for putting managers in place that don't care about the paying customer. This isn't the first time and I know it won't be the last. Sadly FiOS isn't any better price-wise so I am stuck with Comcast."
"David of Stillwater, MN",7/21/2013,,"On Sundays, my internet speed drops to 2.2 download and 1.4 upload according to Speedtest.net. The rest of the week I am usually in the +20 download, +6.5 upload. Comcast's poor customer phone service routed through the Philippines always insists it is my equipment. US management agreed to run a test the day of the problem the next time I called, but you cannot get that message through their inept specialists overseas that answer the calls. How can you pay more and get less? Satisfaction guaranteed? No way. We really need competition to keep them honest in their claims or at least give us an option."
"george of Englewood, FL",7/21/2013,,"Way too much stuff. I won't get into detail just the list.7) The problem with my web pages disappearing was due to the fact they sold/gave my info to a 3rd party, without authorization.There is nothing less than a new cable company that I am seeking. Nothing. And satellite is not the same. I want freedom to choose cable companies cause Comcast sucks. TY"
"Todd of Fort Collins, CO",7/21/2013,,"Comcast is always charging me additional fees, and I am sick and tired of it. About four months ago, I called and complained about the ridiculously high cable TV and high speed internet service cost, and asked for the most basic TV package they offer, and in turn they gave me HBO. Also, let the record show that I had one of their most basic packages to start off with, so I'm not sure how it gets more basic. I declined their HBO offer but the idiots did it anyway. Then it turns out that the ""free"" HBO was good for a month or two, so I noticed a HBO charge on my bill. Evidently, I was suppose to call them back after the trial HBO period was over to avoid getting charged.To top this all off, their ""high speed"" internet is TERRIBLE during peak use times. Everyone in my neighborhood is on ONE copper cable, so I'm lucky to be able to stream a YouTube video without interruption. I'm switching to CenturyLink. Fiber Optic cable as compared to Comcast's out-of-date excuse for technology. I am very much looking forward to taking back Comcast's cable box and telling them exactly where they can put it."
"Carmen of Miami, FL",7/22/2013,,"In Dec. last year, I decided to change Comcast for AT&T. Comcast was charging me a lot more monthly for services for TV, Telephone and PC (it was a package). They send me the final bill which I paid right away. I had returned all the equipment. Two months later, they send me another bill for $42 and change, and I believe is not necessary because I did pay for a final bill. I am not going to pay for something that I don't have to. They are abusing the charge. Thank you."
"Deborah of New Castle, DE",7/23/2013,,"Through Best Buy I switched my television, internet and 2 land lines from Verizon to Comcast. Installation was set for July 15. The tech showed up on that day on time and after 20 minutes said that wiring had to be re-done on the pole and that installation would have to be rescheduled and that I would receive a call. Two days later I awoke to no telephone service (on both phones). When I finally got through to a Customer Service Agent, I was told that no one could come out to complete the installation until the next day between one and three. A tech showed up at 3:20, worked until 5:30 and then said the connection would not work, that he needed to contact his supervisor and then get back to me. He never did. On Friday, I again called customer service - they said an outside provider would have to do the line work. Being upset that I had no phone lines, I asked to speak with a Supervisor. She said they would try to expedite and that she would get back to me within the hour... She never did. I sent a letter to the head of Customer Service later that day... No response. I again sent a note on Tuesday, March 23. It's been more than six days now - Comcast cancelled my telephone lines with Verizon and have neglected to: 1) complete my service to install the lines through Comcast and 2) neglect to contact me or follow up in any manner. One of the land lines is used for business opportunities which presents a more serious issue for us."
"Lynn of Jacksonville, FL",7/24/2013,,"Have had issues off and on for the past year. Most notable being kicked off the internet while working, and having to reconnect, sometimes as often as several times an hour. Have spent countless hours on the phone with tech support and have had at least 4 technicians come to my home, crawling through the attic, climbing poles outside, and even replacing the modem. And yet the problem persists. At one point last Sept I signed up for ""Signature Support"" thinking that because I was paying extra for the service, I would get improved service... NOT! Not only did I spend hours on the phone with them trying to resolve problems, but they said the problem was not with the router but the computer. They would gladly fix it for an additional fee (by the way it was NOT the computer). At that point in October I realized this was a scam and called to cancel the service. I documented the phone call because I truly couldn't make this up - it was so absurd. I was on the phone for over 2.5 hours and this is what transpired; the first person I spoke with was in Texas. After explaining the entire situation to her, I was told she was not authorized to remove this service, or charges from my bill. I was then transferred to a gentleman in Manila. Once again explaining the situation, he tried to assure me the service was worth keeping; however I told him I wanted it removed and I wanted an updated bill to document that it actually had been removed. He was not authorized to do so and transferred me to a lady in Manila. Once again I fully explained the situation. After lengthy discussion she said she also could not help me and transferred me to CHICAGO. Once again explaining the situation and asking for an updated bill I was told simply to deduct the fee from my bill. I certainly did not trust this instruction and when I asked again was transferred back to Manila! I gave up!! I did deduct the fee from my bill and could write another paragraph about the results but at this point won't waste more time, other than it took 2 more months and at least 3 more phone calls to get the issue resolved. This company used to be the best around. They expanded TOO fast; with WAY too much decentralization of services to be remotely consumer friendly. In their need to compete with other companies (primarily Uverse in our area) they turned into the antithesis of what they once were. Once again a tech came to my house yesterday. I was told that a month after the service (bundled package) was installed in my home last yr the modem code reverted from the ""promotion"" code, which gave me complete services, to a previous code (partial service) which was why I continued to have problems throughout the past year. (4 previous tech visits never figured this out) To add insult to injury I received my bill which had increased by $20 this month. I called Comcast to ask why and was told the first year pricing was a promotion and July marked the beginning of the second yr. When I asked to have the bill adjusted for the service I did not receive I was transferred -- guess where??-- tech support in MANILA. Not only did they not know who the technician was whom had come to my house, but they had no idea what he did other than the report which stated ""wifi in proper working order"". Tech support in Manila has no idea what tech support in Jax is doing. When I told the lady in Manila the problem occurred once again this AM... guess where they sent me?? ---- Signature Support in Manila--- where I was assured that for a fee my problem would be resolved once and for all. Needless to say, and after my previous experience with Signature Support, I completely lost my temper. Won't bore you with the followup. Needless to say... if you are in a community that offers an alternative to Comcast, don't hesitate."
"brooke of Adrain, MI",7/24/2013,,I got the home security and internet and cable package and they told me it will be $150 a month. I got my first bill and it was $500. Next month it was $700 so I stopped using them. They are really rude to you when you ask them a question about the bill.
"don of Seattle, WA",7/24/2013,,"I have been a Comcast customer for years and now I find that Comcast keeps adding new charges to my cable bill. When Comcast changed to digital service a couple of years ago they gave you 2 FREE digital adapters for you other TVs and charged you $1.99 for any more above the first two. Well now they have figured out if you were willing to pay for any above the two free adapters why not charge for every extra digital adapter. When it seems like your cable bill can't get any higher, Comcast will figure out a way to squeeze you for more money.In my area there are 3 other cable companies and I'm sorry I signed a 2 year contract with Comcast guaranteed basic price but what isn't guaranteed is pricing on anything extra which isn't stated in the basic price. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND COMCAST to anyone these days. For years Comcast had a lock on our area but now there is 3 other cable companies so they now have competition. Anyone looking for cable look what the others are offering and their pricing. The service is almost the same BUT the pricing from the others is much cheaper."
"Marcia of Snellville, GA",7/25/2013,,"For the past several days, we have experienced terrible internet connectivity. Normally we do not have major problems, but it has been a chore just to browse the internet or even read email. Not to mention the fact that both my son and I play online games. I just spent a frustrating 15 minutes just trying to get the Comcast technician to slow down and speak clearly enough so I could understand what he was saying relative to the connectivity issues I explained to him. Got disconnected in the middle of that only to get him back on the line and then he kept saying he could not hear me. Instead of trying to find a supervisor, he said there was none available...so I was stuck. Then the call disconnected again....I suspect he just hung up on me.Comcast NEEDS to fix their service problems. Having no alternative to calling in to get another technician or even a supervisor to help if the technician one is speaking with is not helping, is a major problem. Then to top all this off, the very first thing he tells me is our modem is obsolete...and will fail to function within a few month's time. Excuse me? He could not explain that comment to my satisfaction, so he got irritated with me and wanted me to connect my PC directly to the modem bypassing the router. My answer to that was this: If we had decent connectivity up until just a few days ago, how does that change things when we have not changed equipment in our house? Does not make sense.I can't seem to find a direct line to complain to them so came here to submit this complaint. It would be nice if Comcast had someone we could actually speak to without all the runaround and idiotic answers their technicians seem to give us for comment problems."
"maureen of Newark, DE",7/26/2013,,"I set up an account for my sister who is going through financial hardship living in NJ. In 11/11 I set up the account, billing was from my bank, and I received the bills. When I inquired about changing owner of account to my sister I was told that I would need to accompany her into a Comcast office in NJ and do that in person. That never happened but somehow my sister was able to change some of the features of the account when she moved to an apt in the same building in 1/12. When I went to the online chat with Comcast about billing increase, I was told they could not talk to me since I was not the owner of the account due to privacy. This is all despite being the owner and never relinquishing that. I made several complaints but cannot send Comcast email, and no one was willing to help since I was not the ""owner"". When the account needed to be closed due to my sister's pending eviction I also could not communicate with Comcast regarding but went up to NJ to go to the office with my sister for the first time, bring the equipment in, and paid to close out the account. Now they say the account is missing equipment (I am getting the bills to my house still despite not being the owner) and they have gone to collections. It has been a miserable experience all the way around. I feel that they violated their own privacy policy and punished me for that. It is impossible to get resolution when you are not allowed to speak to them and there is no email anywhere on the site."
"Brian of Albany, CA",7/27/2013,,"Comcast sent a new modem, promising it would deliver much faster internet speeds. I dutifully installed it. Sometimes speeds were great, other times they were terrible. I called support, and they tried resetting it. No help. They then passed me onto service level 2, who inform me that for a mere $80 they'd help me solve the problem. I protest that the problem began with their new equipment, and that charging me $80 for making it work as advertised is tantamount to charging me $80 for my ""free"" new modem. They refused to engage with this argument, and insisted that I could either pay the $80 or attempt to have level 1 service (free) fix the problem. And they assure me that level 1 service cannot fix the problem. Total scam. This company is run by piratical leeches. STAY AWAY FROM COMCAST!!!!!"
"Joseph of Plainfield, IL",7/29/2013,,"I have been a subscriber to Comcast services for just over five years. I subscribe to home security system, phone service, internet and cable TV. Up until October of 2011 everything worked fine. During October of 2011 I noticed my internet becoming very slow. After about two weeks having experienced this I called and made a service appointment. Someone came, checked it and told me it was fine. The internet continued to be slow. During the next three months I continued to complain, made service appointment, had modems replaced, things adjusted, repeaters installed all to no avail. In February of 2012 my Comcast phone service stopped working. I called, made an appointment, took time off of work to meet the tech at the appointed time and it he/she did not show up. At this point I started documenting the problems and dates in regards to my Comcast services. I called Comcast to complain about the no-show and to which they apologized and gave me a $25 dollar credit on my bill. I reset the appointment for the following week February 21st between 12p-2p. I adjusted my schedule to be there. On that day 2pm came and went. I waited until 2:30PM and then called Comcast to see why the tech did not show. Again they apologized, assured me the tech was on his/her way and credited me another $25. I couldn't afford to wait and had to reschedule the appointment and return to work. I again rescheduled the appointment for March 7th between 5pm-7pm. On that day the tech showed up and came into my home. At this point my internet speed was at a running slow but it was almost non-existent after 9pm, one of my comcast DVR's had stopped working and I couldn't get a dial tone on my phone. I explained all of this and he excused himself and went outside to make a call. After about ten minutes another tech showed up and informed me that neither he nor the first tech were allowed to cross my home's threshold because I had the Comcast Home Security system and because of that only certain specially bonded technicians were permitted to service my account. At this point I was extremely frustrated both because I was being billed for services that I wasn't receiving and for all the time I had wasted in trying to get the problem resolved. I did not call them back for three weeks. During those three weeks I began experiencing problems with my home security system. The cameras were not reporting and my remote light switches stopped responding to the control device. I called Comcast to set another appointment for April 4th, 2012 between 8AM-10am to have all of the issues looked at. In the interim I returned two of my DVR's to their Romeoville office as one had stopped recording and the other stopped responding to the remote control. They gave me two refurbished units as replacements of which only one worked. On April 4th I scheduled additional time off of work to be home for the appointment. 10AM came and went and I headed back to work at 10:01AM. I called Comcast so angry I could barely speak properly and again they apologized and offered to reset the appointment. It was at this point that I asked to have my services cancelled to which I was told I could not cancel my non-functioning phone service because, somehow my home security system was interconnected to it and if I wanted to cancel my home security system I would be responsible for a $1600.00 cancellation fee even though the service wasn't performing as promised. Since that day I have been in contact with Comcast's managers, corporate people, local reps, and had many more tech visits. Some successful, some not. Not until September 20th did a tech come to my home and get my phone working again. I was without phone service for roughly seven months but charged for it and paid for fear of negative credit reporting if I refused. Since November of 2011 I have replaced nine (9) DVR's in order to get three that are now working properly. My home security system has worked approximately 30% of the time that I've had it and when I ask to cancel that part of my service I am told that I will have to pay a hefty early termination fee. There is so much more. The hours of telephone conversations with uncaring reps. The same questions and suggestions for a do-it-yourself repairs. I'm writing this letter tonight because, once again, my security camera are not functioning, my remote light switches and thermostat are not responding to the control pad and my internet slowed down considerable since 9pm. I called a little while ago to schedule yet another appointment. I have documentation to back up what I've written and photos of my blank screens. I probably could have been more articulate but frankly I'm just tired of the whole mess and no one seems willing to make it right after nearly two years of constant problems. Please help."
"Thomas of Heiskell, TN",7/31/2013,,"I upgraded to the Xfinity internet with Comcast and have had nothing but trouble with tech support. The techs are just probable just doing their jobs and are polite, but the problem is they want to transfer you to level 2 if level 1 can't fix the problem. They must be from some foreign country as they are hard to understand and don't listen to what you are saying. They ask for the same information over and over. Then they repeat what they said several times and by the time you tell them the problem, they want to know the same thing over again until you become so frustrated you want to throw the phone at them. Well, by the time you get to level 2, they want to charge for the service level 1 couldn't handle. This is not the first time I have had trouble with them. I switched to Comcast several years ago and it took 6 months to get the billing and problems fixed."
"Yanickg of West Palm Beach, FL",3/2/2014,,"This is after over several hours on the phone with Comcast Cares Support and on Comcast live chat trying to get my offer of the upgrade to Extreme Internet Service at no additional cost as per the letter I received in the mail. I ended up losing consciousness and when I woke up my blood pressure was still a bit high, but I have to go check with my doctor... I am certain that my health crisis was caused by being increasingly frustrated by the lack of support while speaking to Comcast representatives, which kept augmenting my blood pressure. I am a cancer patient so I am very susceptible to physiological changes in my body, especially since I am undergoing chemotherapy. I really thought I was going to die. I couldn't get to the phone fast enough. All I could think about was my kids. I never got an ambulance, regardless of how much I begged the representative to contact emergency services for me since he was my only hope.My son is coming to pick me up to take me to the hospital right now. The vision in one of my eyes is still blurry even now. It was fine before I had to deal with Comcast Cares support. The stress of hours upon hours of trying to get my issue resolved with Comcast just caused my blood pressure to rise out of control and this happened while I was talking to a Comcast Customer Care representative. My issue with Comcast still remains unresolved.I am so scared. I am so glad I did not die as no one came to my house to help me. I could not get to the phone in time, so I begged the representative to contact emergency services to help me. I was not able to read anymore since my vision got blurry. I was able to type since I am able to type without having to look, so I was hoping that by begging the representative to call for help for me would result in an ambulance to come to my house. But no one ever came. God must be looking out for me. God bless you all! I am very glad to still be alive."
"Ang of Monroe, GA",3/4/2014,,"I was lied to, intentionally, by two employees about the package they were offering. It sounded too good to be true so I explicitly asked and was told Yes. When the cable was installed and I saw the package was not what I had been promised, I called. After 4 transfers and a 2-hour hold from one rep to another (I think they were hoping I would hang up), I decided to go back to DirecTV, regardless of the cost. Worst service I have EVER had."
"Tom of Hypoluxo, FL",3/5/2014,,"I am a snowbird. I called on Monday, March 3, to report that the cable box doesn't respond and that I would like a service technician to come and replace it. I was informed a technician would come between 1-3pm on Tuesday, March 4. At 4pm that day, I called so many times I can't remember, and was told that I was mistaken about the appointment time. It was rescheduled for Wednesday, March 5 between 1-3pm. I decided to drive to the Lake Worth location and replace the box myself. They were very nice at that location. I replaced the box myself, called the number provided, 1-855-OK-BEGIN. Went through an automated sequence, but the cable box didn't respond. But, at least the BYPASS light was illuminated (the box I returned was totally dead). I was told it would take 45 minutes (by the automation) for the system to load the information. I was also told that my service call was open and that the expected time of arrival by the technician is between 2:50-3:10PM. Needless to say, as I type this the time is 5:18pm and no call, no service technician, NOTHING. While I waited, I logged on to Comcast.com to try and get resolution from there... nothing again. I have called about 4x. I have been asked the same questions over and over again with the same results: NOTHING. I requested for a supervisor to call, put on hold and then disconnected. This happened 2x. Right now I got hold of yet another person and was told a supervisor will call me back. THIS IS DISGRACEFUL SERVICE. How can we have this kind of service (or lack thereof) in this country? You would expect it from a 3rd world country? What is the problem???? I am so upset right now. I will report another complaint/update if there is one. I am exhausted right now. This is supposed to be my vacation and I've wasted two days out of my week!"
"bobbi of Kirkland, WA",3/5/2014,,"In January 2014, I was told by two sales associates in my local Best Buy store about the virtues of Comcast. The $39.99 monthly fee was very attractive and I scheduled an appointment for installation. I was purchasing only the internet and phone service and have been very pleased with it. However, I received a bill for over $100 for various fees beyond the $39.99 fee. The representatives had assured me that additional charges that appear on a typical phone bill (taxes, surcharges, etc.) would no longer appear with Comcast. On a subsequent visit to the store, the representatives told me that they couldn't do anything about the bill and that I should contact Comcast directly. When I called customer service, I received a runaround with no resolution. I wrote the CEO of Comcast and enclosed a check for a month's service, with no reply and they have not cashed my check that I sent to the CEO on February 19. Since then I have received calls from Comcast threatening to turn off my service because I will not pay their inflated bill for services that I was not informed about. I have been attempting to reach the Best Buy manager for three days, but he has not returned my call. My option is to go to the store and speak with him. My next option will be to go to my local TV station which has a reporter that chases down circumstances where that consumer has been wronged. Comcast falsely represented the terms of their service. They are unethical. Somebody there needs to go to charm school. Admitting their deception and correctly billing me would be a pleasure."
"Ted of Jacksonville, FL",3/5/2014,,"On March 4, 2014 I placed an order online via Comcast website to have services installed at my home in Jacksonville Florida. Comcast offered online a basic digital service of $19.99 and an installation date on Sunday March 9, 2014. Today I received an email from Comcast advising that it was crucial that I contact a toll free number and speak with a customer service representative to discuss the proper selection, billing, and installation of your chosen services. Upon contacting the customer service representative I was informed that the package I was offered online and that was confirmed online I would receive was not available and the only other basic digital option offered was for a price of $44.99. In addition, the installation date that I chose online (Sunday March 9, 2014) that was also confirmed online was no longer available and the next date was Wednesday March 12, 2014.I am extremely disappointed in the way Comcast portrayed a service package and an installation date to me as a consumer that was never available in the first place and that I was dumped into the lap of an offshore third-party company to handle my dissatisfaction and who has no authority to assist me (the consumer) with my concerns I have as it pertains to the bait and switch practices I have fallen victim. When I asked for an escalation number to voice my concerns I was told to go to Comcast website. Being that Comcast has a monopoly on cable services in Jacksonville my concerns about Comcasts unfair practices as a consumer is warranted for regulatory review. Prior to my filing complaints with all the regulatory agencies and advice from my attorney, I wanted to first provide Comcast with the opportunity to assist me with resolving my legitimate concerns pertaining to unfair consumer practices.Please contact me ASAP to attempt to resolve the issue and restore a customers confidence."
"Michael of Santa Clara, CA",3/5/2014,,"I recently discovered that Comcast erroneously sent an incorrect bill to a collection company under my name and social security number. This erroneous report damaged my credit at a time when I was in the process of purchasing a home. I recently discovered this error and have asked Comcast to send me a copy of the bill that was erroneously established using my information. Since this happened in 2010 the representative I spoke with today, ID **, is stating that she can't pull up this statement even though other Comcast representatives have told me that they can.Comcast is insisting that this was a case of Identity theft and not a mistake of Comcast. I've filed a police report at the advice of Comcast and even the officer taking the report suspects that it was a mistake by Comcast. I feel that I am entitled to receiving the statement that damaged my credit but have tried many ways of getting this without cooperation from Comcast."
"Elizabeth of Jacksonville, FL",3/6/2014,,"On Feb 28, 2014, I paid my Comcast bill. On March 4, I paid my cell phone and everything was fine. Yesterday, I came home and was told we have no Comcast service, so I call Comcast and a automated voice ask if I have another credit card. It said you have to say yes or no. I waited until I got a hold of a Comcast rep. I was then told there was a system error and to wait for him to correct the problem. He tells me to turn off my phone. I ask him, ""Which phone, the house or my cell?"" He says my cell phone and that my next payment due is 4-4-14. Now why would Comcast have anything to do with my cellphone service? Once I turned off my cell phone and my Comcast service started up. I think this is very illegal. Why would my cell phone have anything to do with Comcast service? I called Comcast and was blown off. "
"Justin of Lombard , IL",3/6/2014,,"After $400 of rewiring my house with cat 6 cable and high speed LAN and being promised a new outside drop line. I had to argue with a contractor to call his supervisor because the contractor that added an additional box split off the amplifier which caused our service to cut out even more than what it had before they started. The tech told us that the signal coming into the house was -8 db when their spec was suppose to be -10 to+10 db. Even after I told the supervisor that the outside line had been damaged when tree branches fell on it multiple times and I had to rehang it and that our service had been cutting out before we upgraded and the original tech had told us that the line coming into the house would be replaced, I had to threaten to throw their equipment out into the street and cut down their wire from the pole to get him to agree to install the new outside line. After 3 days of waiting at home 8 am - 8 pm missing work and school the new line was installed and I still was losing service. I tried using the better business bureau next. THIS IS COMPLETELY USELESS!!!!! TO GET A BBB RATING OF A+ COMPANIES ONLY NEED TO RESPOND even if their response is to tell you sorry your S.O.L or f.u. This got me a response that gave me my 7th work order number. They sent out a tech. I made him measure/test every out let after they cleaned up a rats nest of wire the first tech left hidden in our attic. (Tech even took pictures to back bill the contractor that originally short-cut our install). Dimetrea from Executive level care was responsible for this BBB complaint twice now, she has tried to close the complaint without verifying my issue was resolved. I was only issued 1 $25 credit for a missed visit when they had missed 3 days worth of appointments and they claim I was issued a $45 credit toward my 1st months bill but that was part of the original promotional deal. Our first bill was $345 after their credits for phone internet and high def TV. This is nowhere near the advertised rate of $120, our next bill was $160 with taxes. Apparently no matter how much time they waste of yours it's only worth $25. Their guarantee is completely worthless and is false advertising. Just like their ad claiming they are better than U verse and its old wires. They are using old wires just the same and even if you are at the bottom of their specification it's good enough. If you want your equipment installed right, ask the tech for their tech number, if they give you a phone number kick them out of your house!!!! If you get a 4 digit number you can relax a little your equipment will be installed half ass right. And be prepared for them to try to talk over your head like your an idiot. This is the mistake 3 of the tech made. I am electronics tech myself! I had -8 db signal coming into an amplifier and then split off on a 3 way slitter. This Crappy installation is acceptable to them!!!!!If you are having similar issues file complaint with the BBB 1st, the attorney general of your state 2nd and the FCC 3rd. There are many people out there trying to fight the monopoly of Comcast. If your like most people like me, your choices are CRIME CAST OR SCREW VERSE. This is called a MONOPOLY and it is suppose to be RESTRICTED and REGULATED. So why are we FORCED to choose between LACK OF SERVICE and NO SERVICE or PAY OUT A$$ FOR SERVICE WE DON'T GET? WE NEED TO JOIN TOGETHER TO FIGHT BACK!!! Before Comcast consumes all and we are forced to abide!!! If your ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE is worth a ** send them Comcast's guarantee. And explain how your experience has failed to live up to their advertising. I am sick and tired of these corporate oligarchy's ruling or way of life. MOVETOAMEND.COM. Join now and sign the petitions to fight back against CORPORTOCARCY!!! "
"patricia of Englewood, FL",3/7/2014,,"They would not credit one day of 3 years of bad service. They told me to use my internet that I had to buy a splitter and router. Unhook my tv then hook up my internet, with a broken spine and nerve damage. If that is not worth a credit of some type I do not know what is. I have tried to talk with corporate in Philadelphia but you can not get anywhere. Forget Florida Corporate they are even worst. Join our voice, in numbers we have power. I have the FCC applications which they have 30-days to answer. LET'S SEND THEM ALL IN AT ONE TIME TOGETHER. SAME PARCEL, SEND TO PATRICIA ** **. I HAVE A COMCAST PHONE. IT DOES NOT WORK."
"Cecil of Sharpsburg, GA",3/8/2014,,"Comcast Installation crew installed new cable from Pedestal to pedestal which ran the entire length of my front yard while it was raining. During installation, my sprinkler was broken by Comcast crew and did not repair, and then covered it up. Comcast crews dug in three large areas of my yard chopping my sod in small pieces then back filling holes without packing or leveling. Comcast crews Left Red Georgia clay covering the entire length of curbs where they installed the cable. Comcast did not come close to putting it back to which they found it. If it were a cow pasture it might be appropriate. I've requested these items to be repaired immediately. Waiting for reply."
"Evgeny of Hanover Park, IL",3/11/2014,,"I ordered new internet service with Xfinity Comcast. First of all, the price for the service I picked on their website was $44.99 plus $34.99 for installation. A few hours later,  I received confirmation email with a different price for the service - $54.99 and installation $34.99 Plus they set up an appointment for installer to come, it was 2 hour window between 10 am - noon on Feb 19. I called them to ask about the prices. They said it was a mistake and they corrected the price. Got second confirmation email. They kept the appointment for the same time. I do have copies of those emails. According to their customer policy, if installer comes late, after 2 hour window, they credit my account $25. That day installers came at 12.45 pm, 45 minutes late. At 12.15 pm I called them to find out if the installer is coming. They answered yes, and confirmed that they will give me $25 credit. That day they did not install the service, saying that their cable outside was too low and another line technician should come and fix it first. 2 days later technician came and did nothing, saying that everything is fine and scheduled another appointment for installer. 2 days later another installer came and told me that the cables were too low. He called to the office for line technician to come again. Next day line tech came and told me the same thing, that the cables were fine. I called to Comcast, and they called a local office right away. A few hours later another installer came a finally installed the internet. I called to local office to find out what was going on. A few days later, a supervisor from local office called me and apologized. He told me he looked at my account and said that Comcast waived installation fee and credited $25 for installers coming late first time. About a week later I received bill in mail, and there was no credit or adjustments, plus installation fee was not $34.99, as stated in confirmation email, but it was already $39.99. Called Comcast again, first they told me they will take care of it. 2 days later I could see only that they reduced the bill from $87 to $67, only $20 less. I called again, this time they said they can only reduce installation fee in a half, that was those $20 for. But they cannot issue $25 credit, because they did not have a proof that installer came late. In their system it was showing that I was given appointment window from 8 am to 8 pm, and that I called that day at 12.15 am. And installers came at 11.06 am, which was not true. I told them that I have a copy of email with appointment confirmation from 10 am to noon, and a automatic voice mail reminder from them. They did research, and told me they found a copy of an email that was sent to me and finally agreed to issue me a credit in the next 24-48 hours after my last conversation with them, which was on March 4th, at 10 am. Today is March 7, 10 pm, and no changes on my account have been made. I did record my last conversation with them, when they agreed to give me a credit and have a copy of it."
"David of Naples, FL",3/11/2014,,"My complaint is as follows; Over a month ago I contacted Comcast regarding a move my wife and I anticipated. I explained that we wanted to retain our original services whereas we were satisfied with what we had. I further explained that we were moving within the same area (subdivision) and expected no changes other than you folks moving our services.Unfortunate for us Comcast dropped the ball and did not have our services move as requested, I had to call Comcast the day of our move in order to get our services activated. Several issues presented themselves from that moment forward. 1. You changed my home phone number to another number and left a recording on my original phone number letting callers know the number was no longer in service and then directing callers to contact me at ** (my limited use cell phone). 2. You had my account blocked from me being able to login. I had to contact your customer service to get access to my account. 3. When I finally was able to login successfully I found that my bill was astronomical. I contacted your billing department and was told my bill reflected an extra month due to being a new customer. I tried to explain that I had been a long time customer and that we had only moved our services. However your billing department couldn't understand me because they were in the Philippines and didn't understand what it meant to move within the same area.Every time I called your company to have this resolved I got forwarded to another country and either they were unable to understand me or I couldn't understand them because of the language barrier. Our issues are still not resolved and I expect they never will be resolved."
"katrina of Placerville, CA",3/12/2014,,"I signed up online for internet + free HBO for 12 months, 39.99/month. A few days ago I get a bill for 218 bucks! They are charging me for boxes and modems even though I had my own at the time I signed up. Since my husband was deceased, they made us drive over 100 miles round trip to give them that set of boxes and the modem back. Now, they are charging me more than double the original price. I tried to make payment arrangements... since they say I am in collections... even though this is the first bill I have received. They will not make any arrangements. Also, they say that if I just get the internet (which is what I originally thought I was ordering), I will have to pay 66 bucks a month for just that. So frustrating. The customer service was awful. I mean hey, do they want my money or not?!?!?! They say they will turn me off next week and then charge me for that too. I tried to pay them today and set up another payment for the first of the month, but they refused to do that. They are rude. Every single thing you want to talk to someone about... gets you transferred to another section/person. Come on Comcast, get it together!"
"Joseph of Fort Pierce, FL",3/13/2014,,"Six or seven months ago we were having random pixelization on our TV screens. It turned out to be a community problem, not just us, that had the problem. Calls to Comcast and visits by techs did not solve the problem. Finally a tech came to the house and did some work in the attic. The problem still not solved after his efforts. Next month I get a bill from Comcast for 88+ dollars. I made a call as was told that the charge would be removed from the bill. It never happened. Subsequent calls bore no fruit. I just kept paying them their monthly Internet charge and no more. A couple of months after the tech's visit, the pixelization disappeared. Today, they cut off my TV and Internet service. I tried to contact Billing but, to no avail. I went down to their Center and they could do nothing. Finally, I got to Billing and stated my case. They filed a case number and said I would have an answer in 24 to 48 hours as to the charge removal. I paid them their, undeserved bill, with the understanding that I would receive a credit but, no guarantee I was told by the originator. What choice do you have when they are the only show in town? They are too big and like the robbers barons of old, need a T.R. to straighten them out. But, we don't need regulation. What a joke! I hope the arbitrator is a Democrat. Monday, I will call to see what happened. Charging me for their problem is not my concern. They have a lousy organization and care little for people - just profit."
"Barb of Vancouver, WA",3/13/2014,,"Cable and Modem have both had problems with inefficient service for the past year. The apartment we live in does not allow any television provider other than Comcast, which gives them a monopoly! Our internet is less than perfect, and we were told the best way was to upgrade to their blast service! A way to make more money off of their customers! We have had our service suspended even though we have paid the huge bills in the past, and then they have lied about suspending service saying they show no record of this! Recently we had a technician out to check our modem and our cable box and he indicated he thinks we need to have a full survey of the wiring in our apartment, a charge to us even though it is not our responsibility to maintain the wiring service in a place we rent! Also we had a phone number ported from Verizon to Comcast that took four months for them to port - another ploy by Comcast to screw with their customers and add additional charges! They keep telling me to take my inefficient modem and cable box to their local center to exchange - the only problem is when you go to their center you have to wait for service, sometimes as long as an hour, and some of the representatives are rude and nasty to the customers! Since when does a customer who is having problems with equipment have to wait to get it exchanged? They are nothing but a monopoly and should be put out of business! I am seriously considering cancelling any cable service and looking to another internet provider soon!"
"smart  of Philadelphia, PA",3/14/2014,,"I got my wake up call when I was trying to establish new services with them. (yeah I know I had a moment of stupidity. lol) The Representative got an attitude with me because I started questioning him about Comcast's charges, and their billing system. I was not about to agree to give them my hard earned money for nothing. He ended up putting me on hold and then never came back to the phone.By the way, this Representative was an Executive from the Philadelphia Corporate Office. That told me everything I needed to know about Comcast! I called back and immediately cancelled my pending install. If the people at the top are like that, you know what you are in for. Everyone I have spoken with has had nothing but BAD things to say about how they are being ripped off by Comcast. I have heard countless numbers of horror stories of being overbilled and overcharged.So my advice to anyone who is considering getting service with Comcast is to do your research! My advice to you is to cut these sharks loose Today! and find another option in your area! Don't be pulled in by their empty promises and enticements to try to keep you as a customer so that they can keep their hands in your pockets! Walk away while you still can!!"
"Charles  of Montclair, NJ",3/16/2014,,"Comcast provides me with its ""Triple Play"" package (phone, internet and cable service). Phone calls occasionally go dead, computer service is interrupted and cable reception lately ""freezes"" with a need to load the Comcast transmission of the NetFlix ""House of Cards."" Several technical service people have been sent--each has been professional, helpful and made fixes that have temporarily lasted. However, each service person disagrees with and/or changed what his predecessors did. Consequences: Service problems continued and unreasonable amounts of my time are needed to reach Comcast. The latest example is that Comcast replaced its Xfinity router with a newer model, suggesting the previous model may have been the cause."
"Jeffrey of Jacksonville, FL",3/18/2014,,"For 7 months (June-Dec) Comcast billed me $7.00/month for a cable modem rental. For 2 months (Jan, Feb) $8.00 for a cable modem rental. I own the modem that they are charging me for. I hadn't realized they had been charging this monthly fee for a modem rental until recently, as I just pay my bill as it's a flat fee and doesn't change. I contacted Comcast (after several hours of frustration of being hung up on and wrong transfers) and they agreed that they should not have been charging me the $7.00 and $8.00 monthly modem rental fee and that I did indeed own the modem they were erroneously charging me for. Comcast said that even though they were in error charging for 9 months, they will only credit me 3 months as itâ€™s their policy.I have researched and found that this is a wide spread problem with Comcast fraudulently charging its customers for equipment that is customer owned and when customers realize this Comcast refuses to refund the amount owed to the customer. They have also sent a collections agency named Equipment Recovery Services in an attempt to collect the modem that I own and they admit I own. The collection agency calls multiple times a day via an automated dialer and leaves a 49 second automated voice mail message each time."
"Ema of Princeton, IL",3/18/2014,,"Ordered stand alone tv service. Price was advertised at 49.99 for 80 channels. They accepted my order, then told me over a day later, a wasted hour of time, that they could not honor that price, because 'it was not in their computer'. They tried to tell me my internet service was going to be charged more as well. I've had enough of price gouging, false advertising and customer service reps who put you on hold, refuse to actually deal with an issue; rather they say 'I understand', no they don't. Last time I checked, false advertising of services was against the law in the USA."
"anonymous of Rockford, IL",3/18/2014,,"I have been with Comcast since they started in Freeport, IL. Whatever the name was we put up with change and growth. It leveled out for a while then they started trying to push in every area phone security recently trying to beat Genie and the Hopper with the X Series Box. Now the customer service is horrible. They tell you one thing then another rep says â€œNo, they were wrong; itâ€™s this way.â€ Sometimes 3 or more reps doing that till you don't know whatâ€™s up or down. Then the techs come me personally. Have never had a bad tech. The opposite I have great techs sent and talk and have fun. Also get inside info on Comcast. The techs know more than the phone reps.I fought for a security camera - just the camera. Well the tech came, never heard of just camera. Was usually a user installed product but a rep made it a tech install 9 am till 1 pm. No not the tech, the Comcast area. They call, would not listen to me or tech reset my password when me and the tech said itâ€™s working and not the problem. I saw they were playing games. Didnâ€™t know but letâ€™s act like we do. The Comcast side missed what they all should know. My router settings were off. Me and the tech figured and fixed that with no help from Comcast. Now all installed just to find out I have an expensive best I have seen (I am a security specialist retired and retired response officer). I have looked hard and not many cameras out that can make day out of night. Most of my work we had to install an IR Flood to get these pics.So I have an evidence dream camera that could be used for evidence because itâ€™s so clear. But itâ€™s useless. I can't use it Comcast website for their home security the toddlers. My wife works with could have made better. It wonâ€™t stay logged in. It wonâ€™t full screen 20 or more flash capture image capture programs free and pay. Can't capture or record. It can't tap into the home hub, absolutely no way. I have yet to find to use your own software. Now their software every 5 min for 15 sec. What the is that joke a night has over a hundred or more clips. I had many times car there. I went out to start it. No car there poof now car running. Made wife clean snow off. Nope now car is gone. One time I got her coming home. There's car, there's her. Nowhere is she. The police laugh so hard at this stuff. O they also give a nice door trigger. Hmm outside cam pointed at walkway and car anyone else see a problem with a door triggered alarm. I have all emails CEOs, the head the committee. You email them. They all drop you to a lower person. Wow what caring heads. What a well run company. There are free to use camera software that could be used to manage their cameras but no. I should have gone to Walmart or eBay and got an IR Flood then I could use the bloody thing. Wow I trusted and wasted time and money on crap.I also see a trend to use the cloud - a service found to have problems, flaws and fills fast Google it. Then smart phones and tablets. Everything X Series cable boxes the phone features. You have to have new smart phones or tablets. I have government Safelink TracFone text and talk. I don't want the bloody web my email a so called camera or camcorder or stupid tablet. So because I like old school Comcast punishes us. Sorry voice commands on X Series Box is smart phone. I wanted better phone number blocking. They said â€œO we have a new cloud service.â€ Then whatâ€™s your smart phone; what its my home phone; why do I need a smartphone to setup my home phone.So us Backwoods donâ€™t want new crap are left behind and told screw you. They move so fast and put so little time in training and getting service reps better trained and equipped. No letâ€™s barrel ahead and screw if the reps know anything. I want to leave but I canâ€™t. My area no other providers. Frontier bad ratings, slower internet and wife has co-workers who hate it. The rest no options. So like prison youâ€™re stuck in your cell with bubba Comcast screwing you up the **. If it wasn't for my wife I would dump them and leave them what we owe and never pay but she needs the net for work and her relaxation is TV. Me I have a terabyte drive music music vids movies. I could live off that and DVDs. I was raised outdoors not hanging inside, only night family TV. So itâ€™s really easy for me to leave but have to keep the women happy and distracted so they don't bug us. I email and call the top numbers daily and not getting anywhere. If you Google Comcast you can get most all emails and numbers. Sites ask for membership. I just do trial with a fake name and one of my 5 emails then those sites tell what they don't realize is hanging out in the wind to be found. But useless they won't answer or do much a few discounts money off account and that but thatâ€™s to me like giving your kid ice cream while beating the hell out of them. O well, welcome to screwed and stuck unless you go without or sat. Thanks Comcast my ** hurts. I need a good Proctologist and soothing ointment."
"Ananth of Aurora, IL",3/22/2014,,"My Comcast Account number was ** and I had disconnected all my services as of 10/29/2013. Earlier I had Double play (cable and Internet) and the bill for the same services up to 10/08 to 11/07 ($89.99+$21.93+tax = $115.91) was paid on 10/25/2013. I had disconnected the cable on 10/25/2013 so in billing from Comcast dated 11/2/2013 (total bill of $16.18), the partial refunds were issued for prorated period between 10/25 to 11/07 for Double play. The internet service was changed as XFINITY High Speed Internet with the net monthly charge of $44.99 (11/8 to 12/7) and also charged for the adjusted period of 14 days (10/25 to 11/07) for $29.33-$9.01 = $20.32 with net total of $65.31 for High Speed Internet service from 10/25 to 12/07.Then I also disconnected the XFINITY High Speed Internet service on 10/29/2013 but the final bill I received on 11/21/2013 had issued the refund for as High Speed Internet only from 11/21 to 12/07 and the refund for the XFINITY High Speed Internet for period between 10/29 and 11/20 is missing which might worth around $40. Even though the representatives agree that my High Speed Internet was disconnected on 10/29, they are wrongly claiming that I have received the full refund which is not true and is totally incorrect.When asked about it, the account rep is confusing with actual order date and completed disconnection date... and also rep is saying that there is no additional charges... and I have not paid for that period and the bill is correct and can't issue the refund. Even I explained I am receiving a refund for Internet services I had paid up to 12/7 but the refund is issued only from 11/21 to 12/7 instead of the actual cancellation date of 10/29 to 12/7. I am not disputing the bill. The bill has issued a refund for me from 11/21 to 12/7 but the actual refund should have been from 10/29 to 12/7. Why no one is able to get this simple issue cleared out and issue a proper and correct refund and how many customers are being cheated like this.What am I missing here? I was on the phone with reps may be more than 10 times for a total of around 6 to 8 hrs...but no use. Why this treatment? They agree that I called for disconnecting my service on 10/29 but trying to come up with various weird reasons to deny my eligible prorated correct refund."
"Marilyn of Philadelphia , PA",3/22/2014,,There are taxes charged 3 times on the bill. Bill amount change from month to month without us adding any extras. How is this legal taxing the same taxes 3 times on one bill. Taxes should be added one time at the end of a bill?
"Selina of Florence, AL",3/23/2014,,"After having Comcast/Xfinity internet service over 7 years, I received a notice saying they had failed to charge me rental for my modem for that 7 years and I would now be charged $7 for it. The very modem they gave me 7 years ago for signing up - 7 years! After an endless battle, I sent them the 7 year old modem and bought a Netgear modem from Best Buy. I thought this would solve the problem - wrong. For the past 4 months, I have had to call each month to have the $7 rental removed. Each month, the rep claims the problem is resolved. Just noticed I was charged again! They obviously aren't concerned with their customers and the needless irritations they create with pathetic attempts to bring in a few more dollars!"
"Christine of Spring, TX",3/23/2014,,"Filed complaint with the BBB. Outsourced customer service is inept & inefficient. Give the runaround & excuses instead of service. Had service connectivity issues for a long time. Each time I called, ""there was an outage"". The issues are consistent throughout the day; intermittent & stops every couple of minutes. A 90-min movie takes 3-4 hours to play out.I called March 19 to request a service technician visit, which was then scheduled for Friday, March 21. We had stayed home all day to accommodate the huge window of ""sometime between 12p-5p."" We received a call about noon from the Service operators & were told a technician would arrive at 2:45p. We asked to receive a call when they were on their way. We received neither. No call, no technician. When I called later that evening, I spent 2 hours on the phone with customer service in Manila, Philippines... From 6:45p-7p, spoke to Robert who could not get my information correct, after repeating my number numerous times. I asked him to update my information, he did not. I asked to speak to a supervisor, spoke to Pao. He gave the reason a technician did NOT come out because we didn't answer the phone when the technician called 3 times. We never received a call from a technician, & regardless, there was someone at the house the entire day. At 7:30p we were finally given an ""Escalated Ticket Report"" which ""guaranteed"" that a technician would call us back by 7:50P to schedule a visit the following morning-service ticket #**. We were reassured to call back if that didn't happen and speak to Pao directly. We received no such call.At 7:55p, I call back & they had NOT updated my information to get through the long menu & maze of prompts. They had a number that had not existed for over 10 yrs which we have requested changed NUMEROUS times before, as well as over 10 times this same evening. Finally reached rep Dana. Seems no one at Comcast listens very well because she AGAIN asked me for my information numerous times. I asked to speak to Pao, she said that it was impossible because she didn't know who that was & there is no way to transfer calls, track, nor locate anyone in any way (he said he was a supervisor). I asked to speak to a supervisor or manager because I have been on the phone for over 2 hours & don't want to spend the entire evening on hold. She put me on hold & never came back. I hung up at 8:24p - that's THIRTY MINUTES ON HOLD with no follow-up.I called AGAIN at 8:24p, quite upset. I reached Nick. When I asked politely to speak to a manager because I have an issue that must be escalated, he disconnected the call without another word. We are paying $130/month for this service & this was NOT proper customer care at all. Relentless to resolve the issue, I called back yet AGAIN at 8:27p. Spoke to Kalhan who said we had no such ""escalated ticket report"" in progress. Took my number to ""call back in case we were disconnected"". Very nicely, she was ""scheduling a technician"", said it was the most urgent of requests, gave me a service #**. THEN she said it was a WAITING list for a POTENTIAL call from a technician by noon the next day, asserting that a call was NOT GUARANTEED. I asked to speak to a supervisor or manager that could escalate it & give me something more precise. At 9:03,she disconnected the call.I waited 10 minutes for the promised call back in case of disconnection that never came. This seems to be a VERY COMMON practice at COMCAST. Called back at 9:13p; spoke to Hendrick who quoted the reason the technician didn't come was because there was a ""power outage"" (a different story than what previous excuses were) which cancelled service calls. He prepared yet ANOTHER ticket #**. Promised that we would get a call before midnight to plan the service visit the next morning. Promised follow-up callback in 3 hrs which never happened. This is a ""24-hour service"". I've now had contact with 6 service staff members who have done NOTHING but disconnect calls w/ no result."
"Robert of Peru, IL",3/23/2014,,"Was charged for a modem that I returned when I bought my own. My wife pays the bills and didn't notice. When I found out, I went to the Comcast office, showed them my return receipt, and they agreed to take the current charge off my account. ""What about the 9 months you charged me for?"" ""We can't do that"" was the answer. Same answer when I complained to the Comcast rep by phone. Overpaid $63 in total."
"Julie of Jamestown, IN",3/24/2014,,"We're trying to sign up for telephone service - 1 1/2 hours, 3 phone transfers later, you have the wrong department, etc - still no service. Incredible! I thought the customer service was reserved for people signing up for services. We've had Comcast services for years & always had difficulty with customer service. BTW, most of us do not speak a second language, having reps that speak English clearly would greatly improve customer satisfaction. But have always had EXCELLENT service with the techs who came to our home."
"Daniel of Sarasota, FL",3/24/2014,,"I have been constantly on the phone with Comcast, one person to the next, get cut off numerous times. I had service installed on Jan 6, 2014, and had asked for their preferred triple play XF. Jan, Feb, March have been charged for the starter triple play XF and the preferred triple play XF bundles at the same time in which the same channels on the lower side were duplicated on the higher side. Who would do that. Prior to my January install, my roommate had the starter triple play XF and when he had been called to South Carolina for an extended period of time, I decided I had wanted to have service put in my name and had requested I wanted to go to their preferred triple play XF with phone, internet and TV all in one. From what I was told in the beginning, they were going to transfer out of his name into mine and then that's when the trouble started. On Jan 3, 2014, Alan ** and myself returned home around 8 PM and found out service was interrupted and set top ""Not Authorized"" bill current and up to date. Called in to Comcast. The lady representative said, ""Indeed service was interrupted,"" and she couldn't do anything at this point because the transition was in process to my Jan 6 install and went without till that Monday Jan 6 install. As we were speaking to each other, she noticed that the way the transition was wasn't done right and proceeded to start fresh and do the install from scratch. Comcast lady rep. said when the installer comes, he will take the existing set top box and installed another one to accommodate my install request and to make sure that the installer gave me a receipt for the one being returned. The installer came, did the work. No problems. I signed the work order along with him of equipment installed and equipment returned without a hitch at that point just like I was suppose to. Needless to say, that's when the billing issues started. Alan received his final unused portion of services not used and then the double bundles appeared on my bill. I made numerous calls, spent days on end, it seemed one rep. after another. The next to the last rep I talked with I explained I subtracted the 3 months of billing for the bundle I did not authorize and paid $62.37. One bundle was $43.00, the other $59.00 and some change in which seemed to be okay and said at this point everything would be straightened out. At this point, we went through the finalizing. She did hers. I remained on the line as she requested, got disconnected. Called back, got a different person. Now things are not right and go through all of it over again. Then there's a price difference - one to the other didn't match. I had gotten cut off 5 times trying to get this taken care of. Also in the meantime, I agreed to do their customer satisfaction survey. At this point I was at the end of my rope and answered highly dissatisfied then get thank from the recording and click disconnected. Now today 3/23/14 get a text message, ""You have a past due balance of $129.00,"" and at a boiling point with the whole shooting match. Daughter-in-Law and my son said we will go down to their office on Tuesday and get someone, whatever it takes one way or the other or going to 2 news organizations and the Better Business Bureau. I have read the reviews of Comcast and noted that 2,000 complaints in one month, 1.5 star rating of that company. From what I gather, there is something to the fact they are merging with Time Warner and it's been forwarded the DOJ in Washington D.C. for their totally out of control business practices. Who gets away with this. At this point, I'm going to write to our Florida Senator and see if they are in the process of helping the folks out on this matter. All I want at this point is my bill corrected. I have all the paperwork, the rebate check that was deposited into my bank account where the previous account holder Alan ** is secondary on the account. Check cleared Comcast Corp ""The Bank of New York Mellon"" in totally at a loss with this. Is this incompetence or what?"
"Melissa of Lake Park, FL",3/26/2014,,We have been with Comcast for 4 years. Just moved to a new home. The tech came out and put a new DVR box and Modem in and took the old with him. Now we have a 890.00 bill for unreturned equipment!!! No call backs!!!
"Al of Thornton, CO",3/26/2014,,"I've had a lot of experiences with Comcast, and mostly have been positive. I received Comcast service back in 2007 and it was that $99.00 bundle special of phone, internet and cable. Well, add in the taxes and all and it was way over $99.00; however, that was not the issue at all. The issue came in after I decided to downgrade from the triple play to just cable, because I was almost never home and I was using the internet for free at work. After speaking with a representative, we agreed that I would cancel my internet for just a number of months.After about 5 months, I decided that I wanted to have internet back at my apartment. I called them and when I spoke with a lady over the phone she informed me that a tech would have to go to my apartment to install the internet. I informed her that I have cable service through them and that I had already paid a tech when I first got my service at that apartment to install the internet. I told her that all I needed was just the modem and for them to re-connect my service, since clearly I had internet from them in that same apartment 5 months, prior. The lady would not accept my information and she pretty much took it upon herself to schedule a tech to install my service. My frustration was that I had a number of friends that had Comcast internet and none of them needed a tech to install their internet when they moved. I was there, so I knew that I didn't need a tech, especially since this apartment had internet before. I ended up having to pay the tech to just dial on his cellphone and tell them to connect service. By the time he had arrived I had the modem installed and connected to my computer. He literately did nothing more than just show up to my apartment, walk in, call Comcast and leave. Now, I've moved about 4 times since then and it's funny how no techs have been needed to install my service at a new house! I just feel that that one lady made Comcast as a whole look bad to me, just because she was poorly trained or clearly wanted to charge customers for tech service.Aside from that, I've had nothing but positive experience with Comcast since 2007. I now just have internet because I never watch TV and when I do, I only watch the free local channels. The internet is fast and I haven't had any issues with it, either. Just a modem that was too old and it stopped working property, it would constantly disconnect but that was a modem issue and not the service. Customer service was very helpful and replaced my modem immediately."
"Bill of Paducah, KY",3/26/2014,,Ordered Comcast TV & Internet was to be $79 plus $20 more for HD. May have a $40 installation fee but not for sure. I already had Internet so installation was simple. So I was expecting a $99 + Tax bill. Got my 1st Bill and it was $378 for all kinds of charges. After many calls to customer service about false Advertising and deceptive promises by sales rep and being charged for things I did not get. They lowered it by $90 but still charged my credit card $378. This company practices deception and downright lies to its customers. Told them to listen to recording of sales call and they won't do it. Needs to have new law passed to control their practices.
"Amy of Cumming, GA",3/27/2014,,"If you have another option, I strongly encourage you to take it over Comcast. I called to have services established because it was my only option in my area and I HAD to have home internet in order to start a work from home position. The first technician came out on a Thursday to install and refused to do so because he needed a handwritten letter from my landlord stating it was okay to drill holes in the wall. Okay, I get that, but at no point during my conversation to schedule the installation appointment did anyone ever tell me this. While the technician was here, he messed with something on the TV which made my dish go out with my DirecTV. He did nothing to fix this and just said sorry and left. Not only did I have no internet when he left but I had no TV either. I was supposed to start my new job the following Monday. The next available appointment date was not for 2 1/2 weeks. I was told that they would push my install through and someone would be out here by Sunday at the latest. I was not confident in this but wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. That was my mistake. I got an automated call that afternoon that they would be at my house the following morning between 8-10 am. At 10:30 I got another call from someone to reschedule my MISSED appointment. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was transferred 8 times. 8 TIMES!! Having to retell my story each time and provide them with information to confirm my identity. I was finally transferred to someone in the billing department that attempted to help me. This is ironic as I didn't even have a bill yet as no service had been established. She said she was sending an email to dispatch and someone would call me back to tell me when they would be here. I did not go to my last day of work because I was under the impression the matter would be resolved that day. Nobody every called or showed. I spent the entire weekend at home....waiting....still nothing. Finally TUESDAY they came out and the technician said he didn't need to see a letter... He did the install and left. He told me good luck with complaining as they don't care.I had purchased a bundle that included internet, cable, and home phone because it was less than a bundle without a phone. I was told on the initial phone call that I would not need to have an actual home phone. I tried to use the services on my TV but they had to be set up with my Xfinity account and in order to verify my identity I had to call them from my home phone. I was told on the customer service chat that I had to go out and buy a home phone to call them from to verify my identity. Shouldn't the phone I called them from to set up the account be enough verification? The technician didn't even install a phone line.My experience with Comcast thus far has been nothing but SUCKTASTIC. I am tempted to move just to have another option for an internet provider. If you have another option then I strongly recommend that you take it. Don't give them your business. The technician said so himself.....they don't care."
"Stacey of Sawyer, MI",3/28/2014,,"Our non-profit acquired a new building in December of 2013 and we were all very excited to move to our new location on February 8th, 2014. Setting up the utilities at the new location while keeping service at the old address was a breeze, so I assumed being able to keep our Comcast service at both locations would be as simple. 10 weeks, countless emails, phone calls and promises later, we still don't have what asked for. I've spent at least 25 hours of my work time on the matter, which caused me to get behind on my actual work obligations. It began with setting up our new service contract on January 15th. I have several emails saved in which both my supervisor and I clearly asked simply for, and were promised, new service at the new building while maintaining our old phone number for about six months with either a forwarding message or actual forwarding service. We still own the old building and helping everyone transition to the new phone number and address was something we held as very important.Sounds simple: a business needs two locations, if only for a few months. One CSA flat out told me we could not have two accounts, another told me to report her for being rude when I was searching for answers. As a matter of fact, I was advised several times to complain about particular Comcast employees. Why is it policy to throw co-workers under the bus? The problem isn't the individuals as much as the extensive bureaucracy, lack of communication, poor training, and total lack of accountability this conglomerate has. Back to the story: despite repeatedly being reassured that we would receive our services as asked for, they cut off our phones early before we moved to the new location. It took over a week of calling on our cell phones to have them restored, after hearing several different stories. The actual installation of the phone and internet service at the new location went very well, our local technician was very good. However, our members, volunteers, board of directors and vendors were unable to reach us for a long period of time. Having the old number was crucial as much of our communication is through the telephone. As it turns out, Comcast not only permanently disconnected our old phone number, it belonged to a different telecom company and we now have to pay to get it back. Fine. I sent in the paperwork over a month ago, was reassured that it was going to be expedited, but two weeks later, there was still no service. I had to call in yet again to find out what the delay was. Yet another Superman took over the account and explained that they never received the paperwork, although I have confirmation that they had. He promised it would be taken care of, along many apologies and excuses. (""We're a large company, ma'am, you can't expect personalized service"". Yes, he said that.) I asked him for an update two days ago, no call, no email, silence. We are a small company, but there is no excuse for the perpetual screw-ups on a very simple order. How do they handle large companies with multiple locations and phone numbers?"
"D. of Memphis, TN",3/29/2014,,"Comcast have the worse customer service in the world. Those idiots only want money. Their service is down most of the time and technicians are a joke, they don't have clue what their be doing. It's a damn shame this company is still in business."
"Christopher of Columbine, CO",3/31/2014,,"The internet service is always poor and overpriced. Not able to get the connection I have paid for. Customer service is cheap and with tons of recorded menus, feels like the goal is for people to give up and stop calling."
"Erika D. of Northport, AL",3/31/2014,,"I am constantly dealing with Comcast for over charging me EVERY single month, for things that they should not. I stated my cable with Comcast set on a particular date and was told that would be fine. Not only I am being billed other than a different date, they are also attaching late payment fees that I should not have. I just paid a bill for $169, without any past due balances. When I check to see how much my bill this month, it shows I owe $386.03 with a past due balance of $184.00 which is untrue. When I ask for the date of my starting service, that aren't able to provide that information, they are also incapable of proving any information about what you are paying for. I am not able to see all of the channels I am paying for. After going through ALL the procedures of making sure everything is working properly, it has been 4 months, and I am still paying for channels I cannot even watch. You are constantly being transferred to a department you don't need, ending up waiting on the phone for hours trying to get what you need just to end up getting what you did not ask for.I had a technician who installs cable too low to the ground and a truck was able to hit the wire and take as far as he was going and was charged for his incompetence after he sat his behind in my house to drink water and rest. The cable boxes they give you aren't any good, which was told to me by a technician, which tells me Comcast truly DOES NOT care. If you live in the Tuscaloosa, Northport Alabama area, there is another cable company trying to expand. It is called U-VERSE. It is still expanding; even if you're not able to get it now, don't worry. You will be able very soon. My advice, until then find another company to go with, because Comcast isn't doing anything but RIPPING PEOPLE OFF. They are just fake as their advertisement. If you want to stop Comcast from doing what they are doing put a limit on what you get, tell them what you want, don't let them tell you. Because the more customers they lose, the better they will get the picture. Remember, they call themselves raising the payments, only because they think that you need them. Companies reputations isn't what they make them, it's what WE make them. If Comcast wants your money, MAKE them earn it. There ARE other cable companies and they WILL be coming to your area. DEFINITION: Comcast- Bunch of thieves thrives to fill their pockets to take advantage, care as less about the customers and more about the pocket."
"Angela of Jessup, MD",4/1/2014,,"Since Nov. 2013, my tv and internet went out. I contacted Comcast, which a tech came out the next day. They installed a temporary orange line from the green box, running in the parking lot and onto the sidewalk to the outside of my house. The tech informed me that a contractor would fix in 5 to 10 business days. No one should up for 3 weeks. I called back again and the rep insured me that someone will definitely come out on Dec 6, 2013. Again no one showed up. The 3rd occasion, a tech came out in Jan, 2014 for the wrong issue claiming my tv wasn't working. Again, I informed that tech the real issue, again promising me that contractor will remove the orange line and fix it. Again, no one showed up. Now the 4th chat online, I explained that it appears like I'm stealing cable and my biggest fear is someone will get hurt with the cord running across the side walk, 3 weeks ago; still no one is doing anything. So, for the last 4 months this has not been handled. If someone gets hurt, tripping over the line the lawsuit is on them. A simple fix shouldn't take over 4 months. This is very poor customer service and need heat under their butts!"
"A of Culpeper, VA",4/2/2014,,"After numerous trips to local Comcast in Culpeper VA, I finally submit a FCC Complaint about losing at least 3"" from screen on TV in house. Comcast sent tech w/ supervisor. OUTCOME? IF I PAY MORE FOR MY CABLE. THEY CAN FIX PROBLEM. FCC refiled."
"R of Alpharetta, GA",4/2/2014,,"It has been an absolute nightmare working with Comcast. Every month, they decide to send us a higher bill than the previous month, and every month we have to call in and argue with them until they meet us half way. Either way, it's ridiculous how these people work. SPEED has been an issue since the day we got the service. They claim we should be getting 20 mbps; however I haven't seen anything more than 5 mbps in quite some time. This is ridiculous and we're about to cancel and switch to AT&T."
"Phil of Pleasant Hill, CA",4/3/2014,,"Comcast. Have you had the unpleasant experience of a subscription with this outfit? If not, I urge you to try anyone but these people. The ""service"" is the worst. This week, the internet, phone, and cable, i.e., all of it has been down as often as not. The packages offered are constructed with a view towards offering things you don't want/don't need/can't use. It's priced higher than anyone else and now, two weeks before the due date of their bill, a computer starts calling on the phone, reminding you of the upcoming bill! This outfit is very bad. Customer service is non-existent. This past week, internet access is down as often as not, which includes cable & phone. We will deduct this from the bill. We will call Astound."
"Freida of New Oslo, MN",4/3/2014,,"I am writing as a potential new customer who cancelled installation at the last minute. Why? Because: I am currently a Comcast Wireless Internet customer who also has DirecTV. I was promised some great promotional prices for TV and Wireless Internet bundling on the phone by a sales agent, which would have amounted to a $40 savings per month. When installer arrived, the prices he had on his work order were suddenly upped to over $40 more per month than I currently pay. I was also promised on the phone by the agent that I would not have to change my current Internet address, even though it is Earthlink.net and not Comcast. This turned out not to be true either, according to the installer.I specifically asked about installation charges and start-up costs prior to ordering the new bundling package, and was told there were none. The night before the installer arrived, I received a last minute email outlining installation costs amounting to several hundred dollars. This was NOT part of the deal, and resent being lied to. I don't like your hardball bait-and-switch tactics. Frankly, this constitutes fraud. Luckily I discovered these things before I opted for your service. If I had found out afterward, I would have called the Better Business Bureau. Maybe I will anyway. I will say that the installer was very nice and polite, and I feel bad that he wasted a trip to my house."

"Patricia of Eagan, , MN",4/4/2014,,"Let's start with the promotions they give you, they do not honor them. They change before it's due to be changed.

"Judith of Kenmore, WA",4/6/2014,,"Comcast stops the streaming of foreign language TV channels and linked YouTube material. I speak several languages and tend to watch/listen foreign TV channels. I pay (well over $100.00) for 80 pre-selected channels - watch 4 channels out of the 80 and I pay for unlimited (high-speed) internet service. This is a ""bundle"". Issues are that (1) Comcast screens the content of the internet and denies the access to foreign TV channels... their excuse is that I am not paying for the extra TV channels (my contract is limited to 80 channels). (2) Since the TV is bundled w/internet Comcast is able to censor what I watch. (3) Why do I have to pay for something that I don't consume? (4) Why is the broadband manipulated, denying equal service to all?Is this legally possible? What happened to good old Adam Smith? How is that the market dictates what I buy and I am not a part of the market? Where is my rational choice?"
"Marcia of Snellville, GA",4/7/2014,,"We recently had a Comcast tech out to check why we kept getting dropped while using the internet. He replaced couplings on the splitter and said he replaced it at the pole as well. He also mentioned we had ""a lot of noise"" in our general vicinity. Why can't they just fix the problems without telling us its our equipment? New equipment, modem not receiving signals is a problem not necessarily our modem."
"David  of South Amboy, NJ",4/7/2014,,"I've been a customer of Comcast for many years and to be honest I've had my ups and downs with this company. I'm paying $230.00 a month for internet and cable. The wireless internet modem that they provided doesn't even reach the other side of my apartment for one. The biggest complaint I have is that I'm paying $10.00 extra for each premium channel. I wouldn't mind the extra money if they would update their movie list on each channel every month. What they do is they ""expire"" a movie on Starz or HBO only to bring it back on another premium channel. Honestly, what is the point? I'm tired of seeing Mama, Predator, Pitch Perfect and so on continuously repeated. Some movies on Showtime and HBO expire and then return as the new movie. Plus they show the same movie on three different HBO channels like HBO-HD, HBO, HBO-E. This is ridiculous and I hope they are reading this."
"Patti of Marietta, GA",4/9/2014,,"I signed up for a bundle of services for a medical office (TV, which we already had, Internet, and Phones). I signed the contract on March 25. I explained to them when I signed up when our previous provider was going to discontinue service and that we had to have an install date before that time. No problem, they said. Today is April 9. We have been without phones or Internet since April 4. This is a disaster for a medical office. Comcast says it's the previous provider. Previous provider says no such thing. Comcast said to just unplug our router and plug back in. Didn't work. Then they said just unplug your phones. Didn't work. They said the install date would not be until April 17. Then they said on April 4, they would escalate the install to April 8 since it was a medical office. Meanwhile, our IT company has tried to talk to them. They get the run around, too. Still today no service. I call the customer service number and get just a fast busy. I emailed the person who sold me the service and told him we were going to cancel our contract. No response. I emailed the coordinator of phone switching. A couple of return emails yesterday. Today, no response. This is the worst service I have ever had with any company. How would you like to be the patient trying to reach us? They are now putting our patients' health in jeopardy. I wish I had gone with another company from the beginning."
"Patrick of El Sobrante, CA",4/10/2014,,"Starting with our bill for February, we noticed over a dozen movies that Comcast claimed we had watched. Most of the movies were pure trash and we would never watch that filth. Calls to Comcast billing got us nowhere as they insisted we had watched all those movies. A visit to the local Comcast office did finally get something done as the rep we spoke with said she would get the movies removed from our bill and also we were provided a PIN number to ensure that no one could watch movies on our account. Guess what? On our March bill 8, more movies had been watched despite having this PIN number to stop that. More calls to the billing department and then passed onto the Tech department. We were told that YES you did watch these movies on your second line and Comcast has the times and dates. The second line is in our guest bedroom which doubles as our home office. The television in that room is only 13 inches while the Main television in our home is in our living room and is 70 inches. What in God's name would we watch movies in an office on a small screen when we have this large television? Did the Comcast rep have an answer? Of course not; he even suggested that someone in the house might have watched these movies without telling anyone. Since it's only my wife and myself and I have out of the country since January that would have been impossible. This rep had the nerve to say that he and his fellow techs had never heard of such a problem and that we must be lying and trying to get out of paying for the movies. That did it. I told this clown that to accuse somebody of lying was beyond the pale and I was filing a formal complaint with the FCC. He quickly changed his tune and insisted that he was not saying we're lying, only that nobody had complained about this happening to them. I told him transfer me back to the department handling cancellations. Finally somebody there realized that I was entitled to these charges being taken off but it would need approval. With that I told her to cancel my entire Comcast service. Without a doubt, Comcast justly deserves the title of worst company in America."
"Jane of Portland, OR",4/10/2014,,"I am writing to detail my experience of abysmal business practices conducted by Comcast, the internet and phone provider. In mid-December, I arranged a transfer of service through Comcast. They failed to show for three appointments in a row during the holiday season--no show, no phone call. I was without internet and phone for eight days. I spent no fewer than 10 hours on the phone trying to resolve that issue. When they finally installed my service, they offered me a $20 credit which was unacceptable to me, so I arranged service with another provider and canceled with Comcast 14 days after the initial installation and invoking their thirty day money back guarantee policy.They failed to cancel my service and instead sent me a series of escalating bills. I had to cancel with them a total of three times before they actually canceled me. They sent a box for me to return the equipment, which I sent back the very next day containing the equipment. They called three more times claiming that the equipment had not been returned. Every time, I gave them the UPS tracking number, date and weight of the package. Each time, I was assured that they would take the equipment charge off of my account.Next, I received a letter from a COLLECTIONS agency for unpaid charges. Comcast claimed that I had not canceled within the thirty days. This, again, took several phone calls to resolve. I am hoping that my Comcast nightmare is over, but I have spent countless hours dealing with inept and rude 'customer service executives.' I have spoken with employees at all levels, sometimes being re-routed 4-5 times in one phone call, and several times being cut-off altogether.I am writing to you to add my voice to the apparent throng of people who take issue with this company's practices."
"Daniel of Salinas, CA",4/10/2014,,"I was not happy with Comcast for a long while before dropping them. I was not getting the speeds throughout the house. Plus, service was erratic, and I had to recycle far too many times. I wanted to buy a modem that was on their approved list. I was told that the installer would bring it with him. But the moment he opened the box, it was still the same Comcast model modem. I stopped him from installing it because I had an agreement through their customer service that he would bring the modem I wanted. I can't begin to tell you how many of their tech and customer service agents I spoke with, all to no avail. It was frustrating, and I spent far too much time on this matter. I filed a complaint and I was referred to their retention agents. They wanted to keep me, but they were wasting their time. I wanted no part of Comcast. They gave me back a check for one month's worth of service. I don't understand why they kept that modem on the approved list if you couldn't use it. About 40 miles from us in another town, I found a Comcast customer using that same modem model we wanted. It was highly rated, but they would not permit me to use it. I found out about this model on a customer review at Amazon.com.When I spoke with the various Comcast customer service personnel, I never knew who I would get, and most of the time, I was routed to different personnel around the country. Virtually, each time, I had to start from the beginning about my problems with their service. So, we transferred over to ATT U-verse. It's not perfect, but it's the only other ISP in our area. Their free Wifi equipment is okay, but somewhat weak for the whole house. So, I bought a Amped Range Extender/Repeater. This really works great. Consistent speeds, and I check the speeds almost every week to make sure we're getting the speeds under our contract. We live in a HOA, and I was one of the first to transfer over to ATT U-verse. Now, there are more users because my Wifi finder identifies ATT U-verse users. Amped includes a Wifi Analytics tool to identify all users in close proximity to my house. Comcast lost a lot of users in our community."
"Gwen of Brandon, MS",4/11/2014,,"OK, I've been a Comcast customer for several years at the monthly rate of $184 per month. After talking to a lot of friends, I realized that I was paying A LOT more a month and getting A LOT less tv. I needed to get my monthly bill lowered. So, I shopped around. U-verse is not in my area yet. However, there were other options, Direct, Dish & AT&T, that offered me a great promotional package and even when the promotion period was over, my monthly bill would be a lot less than I was currently paying with Comcast. So, I contacted Comcast. They were SO very apologetic for my high bill, offered me a credit, and offered me an amazing new deal. Everything that the others were offering. I got my bill down to an affordable amount. They sent me new equipment for every tv... SO EXCITED!!! Right? WRONG!!! Received my new equipment. It didn't work. Contacted customer service. They sent me new equipment again. It didn't work. Called again and they were able to reboot it, and it worked. Get my bill. My bill was $40 higher. They charged me for their equipment not working each time and for having to send a signal to reboot it. That was called a ""technology fee"". There were charges for HD, DVR that they said wouldn't be charged. There was a fee for ""change of service"". I guess that was when I called to renegotiate my bill. So to sum it up, the ""credit"" they gave me for paying too much, they just added new charges and got that credit back. The agreement originally made was that my bill was $99.99 for tv and internet. Four months later, my bill is back up to $184/month and when I call each month to discuss it, they just politely tell me that I didn't understand the arrangement. So I'm sure this will show up on my credit now. I now have DirecTV and LOVE IT!!!!!!!!"
"Taylor of Shreveport, LA",4/12/2014,,"I am trying to get in touch with someone about a few issues that I have with Xfinity/Comcast. I am a new customer and I have not had a great start! I just moved into a new home and I have always been an ATT customer but I wanted to see what my options where so I googled Internet providers and one of the companies that was listed was Comcast. I thought why not try something new so I ordered Comcast internet and I was going to go with DirecTV for the TV. I did not have a chance to order DirecTV due to coming home one night and having my neighbors upset with someone going in their backyard without permission and then a bright long cable going over my fence into their yard. I also noticed that person who set up my service drilled a hole into the side of my home and did not inform anyone that he was doing so. By all of that happening my HOA President informed me that I would be fined a fee every day until the cable was removed from the side of my home and from my neighbor's backyard. I came home yesterday (4-12-14) to notice that the cable was not any longer visible and that means someone came to my backyard and did not let me know that they were coming.My next issue is that I called Comcast about my first issue to inform them about the cable in my yard and in my neighbor's yard and that they drilled into the side of my home without my permission and that my HOA informed me that I would be charged a fee every day until it was fixed. As I said before, I was on the phone with DirecTV and I informed her that I was trying to order service for TV and I came home to what I informed you above. When I say she, it was like the 4th caller I got transferred to about this issue. I was on the verge of already canceling my service due to no one being able to tell me anything! She informed me that she would be able to fix my issue and that someone could most likely come out that day although no one did come out that day. They did not come out until 4-12-14. She also informed that she could offer me a great deal with them with a TV/internet double play. She told me that I would get over 80 channels along with HBO and some other movie channels along with 25 megs of internet speed all for $44.99 a month and that it would not be over $50.00 for everything on my bill. I agreed to have the TV installed since the price seemed to be a good deal. I was also informed that I would be contacted about the first issue by one of the special departments but have yet to be contacted. This is the Comcast ticket number- ** for the issues that I have informed you about from the first issue.My third issue is that my installer came out to hook up my service and after everything was hooked up, I noticed that I did not have any of the channels that I was told I would have. So I called the Comcast support number and talked to five people before I got to someone who said they could help but all she wanted to do is upsell me since I was not given the correct service. She told me that she does not know what the person before her did but she cannot do that and that the only package she can offer is for $89.99 or $99.99. I do not understand why one person can offer me something and it's on recording and they will not give it to me. I had my phone on speaker phone the whole time I spoke to both ladies about issue number one and issue number two so I could not be told they did not say what they said. I find that everyone needs to do their job and be honest with the customers. When I asked the last lady for the number to corporate and her name and the name of the lady I spoke to before her, she hung up on me. I find that to be crazy that I cannot even get a number from a customer service person to call and talk to the corporate office about my issue. I come to think that they may train their employees to do this so they don't have to fix issues.I would like to have Comcast to train their customer service agents to not transfer the customers to 4, 5, 6 different agents and not get anything resolved along with not hanging up on the customer and if they want to claim that the call dropped, then call them back although I know it was them hanging up on me. I would like to have Comcast fix the price and if not better give me a better rate. Then I was quoted of $44.99 for all of my cable and internet so that it does not have a bill go over $50.00 a month. I would also like for Comcast to pay my HOA fee that I will be given due to this issue. I hope that someone with Comcast's corporate office will call me so we can talk about what can be done to fix the issues at hand."
"Erik of Auburn, WA",4/13/2014,,"Over the years, I have had half a dozen different internet service providers. The most inconsistent internet signal and unhelpful technical support has been, by far, courtesy of Comcast. Rarely will I go more than an hour without having internet service slow to next-to-nothing or drop out completely. I have tried contacting customer service, but their ""solutions"" seem like they are just buying time to drop a charged service call on you that I would never expect to make anything better. Since everyone I know that uses Comcast has the same connectivity issues as I do, I'm going to use some deductive reasoning and conclude that the service is just bad and nothing will ever be done about it as long as they are the only high-speed internet service option. Enjoy your horrible reputation and piles of cash, Comcast."
"frances  of San Rafael, CA",4/13/2014,,"This company, along with DirecTV and a few others, practice a kind of Monopoly. There is little choice that customers have when it comes to pricing and quality when there are few competitive companies. They know this, so they offer deals that are misleading, change prices, raise prices, charge fees, affix penalties and whatever they can get away with, because they have overpriced lawyers working night and day on loopholes to trick the consumer into having to pay for things they never were aware of, or agreed to and people have little recourse to go elsewhere. I have been with Comcast for over 10 years and have seen my monthly bill go up and up every year without my adding a thing. When I read the complaints on Consumer Affairs and My3cents.com, I am horrified at the trickery and abuses these companies go to, to get money from their customers. People need to take action and get together and report this to the Federal Communication Commission and also get a ""class action suit"" against these abuses. If we don't take a stand, the abuses will continue and get worse."
"Jason of Jamesburg, NJ",4/13/2014,,"On 4/12/2014, I ordered a pay per view fight. Before the main event, the signal shut off. I called customer service. The customer service representative attempted to resend a signal to correct the issue. Throughout this process, she was very professional and helpful. After about 15 minutes on the phone, she stated that a signal would turn on within 15 minutes. If the signal does not reappear, call us back she states. At this point, the main event has started already by reading the status via social media. I asked for a refund because I am missing the main event and why would I pay for a fee if the service is not provided. The representative told me that there was nothing she can do. She stated that her manager said they can't do anything at this moment and that the charge was already processed. So, I am being charged for a program that is not showing. I asked to speak to the manager and she put me on hold. All of a sudden, the call was dropped. I called back and added an option of a follow up call within 30 minutes. Xfinity customer service offers that option in main directory. Another representative named Joseph was more professional and handle the matter promptly. I informed him that I could not receive a refund according to the last representative and her manager. I told him that I am paying for a pay per view service and yet I can not see it. Now, I can't get a refund. He told me that he will be reimbursed for the charges. He was very surprised that the initial phone call was handled in that matter. We ended the phone call. I awaited for the follow up phone call within 30 minutes according to their policy. No phone call was received. I am very angry because initially, customer service said that they can not give a refund for this service. I purchase a pay per view and yet, I could not see the program. Then the manager states that they can not issue a refund. It took me second phone call to finally receive the refund. Horrible customer service."
"James of Scotts Valley, CA",4/13/2014,,"In 2013 Comcast upgraded their technology in California so that everyone must have at least a minimal ""DTA"" (Digital Transport Adapter) box in order to receive any channels on a television set. I had broadband and ""Limited Basic"". Comcast sent 3 DTAs, and they all failed to work... After numerous activation efforts over a few days, they said I needed a tech to make my house ""Comcast ready"". I'm an SBE Certified Professional Broadcast Engineer (CPBE), and I knew my house cabling had no issues.The tech came out and found no issues but discovers that I still have a filter on the pole which must be removed. The filter originally had been placed by Comcast to limit my TV channels to about 2 dozen basics. He said it was supposed to have been taken off by them in advance so that my DTAs would work. Fine - my TV reception was restored with all 3 DTA boxes..Then I get a bill for $50 - ""Failed Video Installation"". I called customer service and explained that they had failed to prep their distribution plant properly for the new DTA devices and that the tech had merely completed that work. The offshore script reader said if a tech comes out, it's always $50 (at the time, now $99), period. That led to an explosive 40 minutes with the first rep and then his supervisor. The latter was poorly trained and had no real idea how the system works and clearly wasn't prepared for a knowledgeable person. This was my worst customer service experience ever. Note that Comcast is cheating the customer here since they are trying to bill for elective plant work on the far side of the customer demark for their own benefit and evidently hoping few would notice. Likely a legal issue could be made of this, even a class action lawsuit. This is dishonest, if not illegal, business.On the same day I drove to the store, a 25-mile round trip since they closed my local one. Those folks did reverse the $50 charge, I thought this was a fluke, but a friend called and said the same thing happened to her, and she had to go to a lot of trouble to reverse the charge as I did. I wonder how many people weren't paying attention, perhaps on auto pay, and just ignored this spurious charge. It appears to be illegal, again because they're charging for their own elective plant upgrade on the far side of the customer demark.My friend reminded me that the ""free"" DTA boxes weren't going to stay that way. After a period of time, they would be billed at ""market rate"", which then appeared to be $1.99/month. That would be $6/month on my bill. Note that the Comcast CEO, Brian Roberts (Wharton School of Business graduate), received total compensation of $29.1 million in 2012 (Philadelphia Business Journal), and we have to make sure he gets fully paid.The DTA boxes provide very low resolution SD quality viewing, probably as a deliberate incentive to upgrade. And upgrade I did - I put a UHF antenna on the hill behind my house and now get 28 channels over the air for my 3 TVs. Not only that, many are in 1080i/720i HDTV quality. For instance, PBS KQED is perfect 1080i, not the low res blurry SD quality from the Comcast DTA. I returned all 3 DTAs to the Comcast store and got a receipt. Now I only have Comcast broadband, which works well, except that it's too costly. I own the modem - they charge $84/year to rent one. Comcast is unfortunately a monopoly so there's no viable broadband competition. Every device that Comcast drops in your home is a miniature Trojan Horse filled with virtual elite robbers instead of armed soldiers. I shudder to consider the proposed Comcast/Time Warner merger. Comcast's only interest appears to be short run profitability, speedy growth, and shareholder value. They appear to be betting that for at least a while they can get away with having myriad disgruntled customers. I wrote my senators strongly suggesting they must ""kill it before it multiplies"", as they say."
"LJ of Houston, TX",4/15/2014,,"Signed up for Blast Plus Promo, digital economy + 50 mbps internet + 12 mo HBO trial at $69.99. After the install, there were no cable channels and no HBO promo. Contacted Comcast. They apologized and said they would change the service to what I ordered and applied discounts to the promo, so I would be billed $64.99 which included the HD upgrade and that would be available for 12 mo. The cable channels still did not appear but the HBO promo was. I contacted them again. They told me there were no discounts applied and that I signed up for the 50 mbps internet + local channels.I stated again that was not what I ordered, and after going round and round with them, they told me a rep would contact me 48-72 hours. They never called so I contacted them AGAIN, and was told that I could upgrade to the Blast Plus but at $79.99 mo + 10 HD upgrade. I have already received my first bill, service hasn't been up a week yet, and they are billing me for an additional cable box that I do not have. The 4th conversation ended with being told that I would be contacted within 48-72 hours again."
"E. of Villa Park, IL",4/15/2014,,"I will start that on June 17... 3 years ago this June Comcast was here telling me they needed to do outside work. Now almost 3 years later that work has yet to be done. I pretty much just run Netflix and Hulu for TV services now. But Comcast called with a deal since we do have their internet (when it works correctly it is the best). So against my better judgement I said â€œOk give me the deal.â€ Issues after issues with cable boxes. Service techs 3-4-5 times to ""check levelsâ€. Oh and letâ€™s not forget they connected my next door neighbors services off OUR line!I once again got fed up with the rotten service and my 12 yr old who after everyone went to sleep would stay up watching the Good Shows as the kids call them that DISNEY only plays at 2-3-4am? Not one of the 4 DVR units worked. So on March 19th I called to cancel services. Now April 15th Services still show LIVE in our acct. Still being CHARGED! SEVERAL calls to customer service one had the gall to say service was never cancelled (but yet I have 3 emails saying it was). One customer service rep gave me the 3rd degree of WHY I am cancelling service? Seriously? How does because I ** feel like it sound? Because itâ€™s really none of your damn business. Email response 5 days ago was â€œWe will call within 24 hours.â€ As of yet not 1 phone call and now got charged for a NEW months of services! So now we are on 2 months of a $200.00 each month of service no one has used."
"Mary of Hollywood, FL",4/15/2014,,"Last week, I had a very low cable in my backyard. I had to call SIX times to get that resolved (and only have filing a report with the FCC). Tonight, and other days this week, I am unable to get the ONLY TWO CHANNELS I watch. I find that VERY strange. Why do all other channels work, except the two that I watch at night. When I asked for a supervisor, I was put on hold for 5 minutes, only to be told that he would be with me in another few minutes. At that point, I hung up. The service I am getting from this company is deplorable. Yet I am expected to pay my bill on time!"
"William of Southfield, MI",4/16/2014,,"No billing complaints yet. Here is my situation. Comcast has people who do not know anything about their job. I elected to increase my broadband service. Comcast did some configuration changes then sent tech out to swap out the modem. Either the dispatch or the tech failed to take notice that I was a business account and installed the wrong modem. When I told them I was still having problems and I had purchased 5 IP addresses.Apparently the tech did not know how to configure a business account and left. Two hours later another tech comes and says he is one of only eleven techs that can handle business accounts. He swaps out the modem. Wait an hour, then he leaves without a full check of the system. Later that even I started get complaints that none of my customers can reach any of my servers. I check behind the firewall and everything seems fine, but on the other side of the modem for anything coming in, there is nothing happening. I have called several times and the techs all tell me the modem is fine because they are testing from the modem on into my network. I try to get them to use a browser to one of my web pages or something and they just refuse to do it.As I bang out this complaint, I am at the Southfield Library performing some tests to my network and everything has failed. I cannot reach any of the web pages and my radio station is dead in the water as well. Now I have to wait another 48 hours for a tech to come out and look at my network. By the time he leaves I won't be able to get out on the net then. I have lost over a thousand dollars because of this. I wish I had not done this and just left everything as it was. It seems that they bring new equipment in service to make money and very few if any of their people are properly trained. The tech on the phone told me that they were still learning the new business modems.It seems that these new modems have issues that Comcast Techs do not know about. Everything looks good on their end and that is what they stick with. But when I can get to my websites and radio station just fine on the inside of the modem, but cannot get to them from the outside of the modem and the firewalls on the servers are down, then there is clearly a problem with the modem. These servers are directly connected to the modem. No other devices are between the server and the Comcast cable modem. I have a 1 o'clock appoint with them today and I have told them that if they cannot fix this, then put me back in the state I was before this so called upgrade. I have lost serious money and time, which I wish Comcast would have the decency to pay me. I can't type anymore, my nerves are shot."
"Kendra of Philadelphia, PA",4/18/2014,,I ordered cable and in one week I had to talk to customer service numerous times. I feel like their prices are extreme. I ordered a package that included HBO and internet. I noticed that some basic channels were missing. I spoke to representative through the chat offered by Comcast and was told I could upgrade. Well I still have not received my premium channels that are a part of a package clearly showing that premium channels are included. They tell me that the package online is wrong.
"Ron of Aurora, CO",4/20/2014,,"Internet locks up, after calling Comcast the service goes to working fine. My wife witnessed this after I got off the phone with them and the internet locked up again. They said it was my computer, lies lies lies. This happens many times on a consecutive basis and they are in denial about the service. I have proof that the fiber optic light is being split as one line goes to comcast and the other to the FEDS.. DATA manipulation is what is going on. This is wrong, this is a service we are paying for and it's costing a lot of money for the Delusional feds to abuse the consumers this way."
"Tonisha of Gaithersburg , MD",4/22/2014,,"I believe this is the worst service I have received. Being that we are a military family I have had several. First, I was given the run around about my service being connected due to the last tenant's failures. I then set a time and date to get connected and was lied to about my actual date of service beginning. I cannot use the mobile app for my security system; I never get a straight answer when I call in. To be paying almost $400 a month this is ridiculous, and the OnDemand is terrible. I have a DVR in every room and cannot even change my recording settings in any of them. I was supposed to receive a gift card and just found out I have to wait 3 months before I was able to receive it. Well, why was that not explained? Coming from Cox I had no choice but to switch; however I despise the dish services but I am going to call them now because this is utterly ridiculous. If Verizon had services in this area, I would have switched in the first week. I've only had this service for less than a month and already have a $600 bill and for this price it is ridiculous. None of the agents are respectful or professional. No one is willing to give you accurate information, and the price is ridiculous. I will never recommend this company to anyone. If asked NO DO NOT GET COMCAST!!!!!! Switching immediately and I don't care what the fee is. That peace of mind is worth the cost!!!!!! I had to click a star to post but if I could, you would get a -10."
"Randolph of Miami, FL",4/22/2014,,"I had previously left Comcast in December of 2012. After many years as a Customer, I could no longer tolerate the long wait either on the phone or at the store. There were many billing errors, order errors and service errors, each requiring a lengthy investment of time to correct. I decided to give Comcast a second chance last month. It did not begin well. I had ordered a cablecard, but it was not put on the truck. When I asked to cancel the cablecard order, the installer told me that dispatch had cancelled the entire order. After several phone calls, the installation proceeded, but took approximately three hours. After installation, I noticed that a very nice feature I had with Uverse was not available on Comcast: the ability to have Spanish CC with English audio. I called. The tech stated that the box I had did not have this capability but would send me one that did with no shipment fee.A week later nothing had arrived. I called tech support again. The representative found nothing in the notes that a new box was sent out. He suggested I go to the store in person and switch boxes. I did so. There was a very long line with only two personnel (the numbers indicated that nearly one hundred people were ahead of me). I left and returned later in the day. This time 60 people were ahead of me but there were four stations so I waited. The representative provided me with a DVR which he thought should provide the Spanish CC. It did not. I called tech support again. They indicated that the issue was not the cable box but the television itself (which is doubtful, because I had the same settings with Uverse and was able to get Spanish CC through its cable box). I called the television manufacturer who referred me back to the cable company. Three calls with three different answers and no resolution to the problem. I have given up on this issue, but encountered another technical problem. The volume control will not control the cable box volume only the television volume. One of my televisions cannot be synched with Comcast remote meaning I have to use two remotes. With Uverse at least I could control the cable box volume not a perfect solution but I could get by. Still no resolution to this problem. At this point, I decided to cancel. I had earlier found out that TMC was not subscribed, despite the original sales representation that it was. The customer solutions person convinced me to stay with Comcast through some promotional offers and subscribing me to TMC. Despite the fact that I had already made five calls to Comcast with NO issues resolved, plus two trips to the store, I stayed with Comcast. One of the promotions included an upgrade of the internet service. This required an additional phone call to reset the modem.At this point, I had made SIX calls to Comcast (a minimum of 45 minutes with numerous transfers) and two trips to the store. Yesterday, I returned to the store to return two devices that I was no longer using and to review my bill which was higher (excluding taxes) than the sales representative had promised. Again, the numbers indicated 80 individuals ahead of me with two stations. I could not wait and returned at the end of the day. This time there were approximately fifty numbers ahead of me but I decided to wait. After an hour, I was called. The representative received the two devices but could not explain the price differential and would not do anything about it. When I returned home, I called Customers solution. The call, including transfers, lasted 70 minutes. Once again the representative convinced me to stay. She told me that she adjusted my bill, and that it would be reflected in the next billing cycle. I asked what to do with the current bill and she advised me to pay the full amount and that any overage would be reflected as a credit in the next cycle. I was uncomfortable with this, as I think it is unfair to overpay, even with the promise of a credit. However, that same night after the call, I noticed that two devices were deactivated each a parallel to the ones I had returned earlier in the day. Apparently, the individual deactivated the wrong devices. At this point, I have made at least seven lengthy calls to Comcast, an unnecessarily complicated installation which failed to provide the equipment requested, four trips to the Comcast store, technical issues still unresolved, and an erroneous bill on my account, and two devices mistakenly deactivated. This is unacceptable."
"Constance of Baltimore, MD",4/24/2014,,I have been a customer going on 2 yrs and never been late or missed a payment. When I came home on last Tuesday and over 50 of my stations had been removed. No notice or anything. When I called they said my plan had been changed and those channels were no longer available on my program and if I wanted those channels I would have to pay more money and to make matter worst the price on my current account didn't go down. I would have thought my account would have been grandfathered in and new accounts would receive the new programming. If I want my channels back I have to pay more money and I get no lower price for less channels.
"Mo of Seatac, WA",4/28/2014,,"I was a customer of your company for over 10 years, and though I've experienced less than stellar customer service from time to time, nothing like the blatant disrespect I've suffered today at the hands of your customer service rep and even a ""supervisor"" was appalling! I called on April 26th, 2014. I spoke with a representative to complain why my bill which has always remained the same amount each month for the past year, since I'm under a 2-year contract, has all of a sudden taken a hike. She gave me three different excuses right off the bat. First she stated that there was a past due amount from AUGUST of 2013 that wasn't paid off (We're in April 2014). Thank God she caught her own mistake quickly. Then she went on to tell me that I was under a 6-month promotion that have expired. I told her the only promotion I was getting was for Starz and Showtime free for 3 months... and those get canceled after my promotion, I don't get charged. That's when I reminded her that my account was and is under contract until April 2015. She went on to tell me this account was never under contract. Now I refuse to believe this since I specifically remember recording my name and social and agreeing to the terms on recording. So we start arguing and I have to say, she wasn't willing to listen. I even advised her to put me on hold and review previous notes, since I've had numerous conversations with numerous representatives as of last year and as recent as March 2014 and that all have spoken to me about the terms and length of my contract. She told me the notes mention a contract but her system doesn't. She wasn't listening to anything I had to say. She argued with me, put me on hold and argued with me some more for an hour, and in that hour, I requested a supervisor 3 times. She told me the supervisor told her what to do, so there was no need to get him. 2nd time she told me he was unavailable. Lastly I requested a contact info to the corporate office. She put me on hold and came back to tell me the supervisor had advised her to go ahead and honor the contract deal for 12 months for the same amount. I was fine with that, then she tells me it will take effect in June. That's when I asked her, I have a May bill in my hand for well over the amount I should be paying. It should start with that. She said I had to pay the May bill fully since the account was NOT under a contract and my ""promotion"" had ended. I disagreed. My account was and is under contract, regardless of what miscommunication is taking place on your end. She said she won't help me with the May bill and that's all she can do. I requested a supervisor for what seemed like the 20th time. Next came an angry male voice on the phone. I took another 20 minutes explaining the whole entire problem to him all over again. He said that he doesn't see any contract on the account. I told him to pull recordings because I was recorded agreeing to the terms. He went on to tell me, if I have proof of this, I should provide it, otherwise I'm wasting all of our time. I asked him what proof? Besides the recording I was told to leave, the account notes from all the reps I've dealt with since April of last year should be there. He said Comcast mails contract agreements. I wasn't aware of that, nor have I received anything besides a bill and perhaps promotional advertising leaflets from time to time. He was not willing to listen, nor hear me out. He seemed to be in a rush, and like he stated, I was wasting his time. He kept asking me, ""Is there anything else he can do for me?"" over and over again to drown my talking. I told him the 12-month deal I was just given to match my contractual agreement amount, should reflect on my May bill, and he said, ""No, like you were told, that starts in June."" I asked him, ""Why is it not starting in May?"" He started yelling and he ended up hanging the phone on me.I am 8 months pregnant, and I had to calm myself down a great deal. I was dizzy, lightheaded and emotionally upset at the end of that 2-hour phone call that got nowhere. After 2 hours on the phone with your company, the emotional and physical turmoil I've suffered was something I didn't count on from a company of your caliber. I pay money to receive service, not torture! I have worked as a customer service, and I myself am a customer of many things. I have never experienced such lack of respect and blatant disregard for professionalism.In the morning, I contacted corporate and complained. I was called back by a corporate thug who told me I should be happy that they've even put me back on a ""promotion"" as opposed to paying full amount. And that this will be my last promotion. I felt belittled, disrespected and insulted. I should be ""lucky""? I don't know when and how they felt the need to announce how charitable they were being to me for the services I've been paying for over 10 years. Their customer service is a lip service because based on the amount of complaints they have from former customers, current customers and soon to be EX-customers like myself, I really don't think they have a lot of time before they go out of business."
"CARMEN  of Pompano Beach, FL",4/29/2014,,"I canceled my account with Comcast a few days after the billing cycle which was on February 17, 2014. Since I didn't know how much they will charge me for the days after the billing cycle and when I called to find out they didn't give me any information, I decided to pay the full amount of the bill. Even though, I knew it would be only 4 or 5 days of charge. I didn't want to be late on my payments. When I returned all the equipment from Comcast, I called to find out when I would receive the difference of the amount pay and the 50.00 dollars deposit and they only say I had to wait a few days for the final bill. I never received the final bill. Then I contacted Comcast online almost one month after that. To be exact on the 3/27/2014 with LIVE CHAT OPTION ON COMCAST WEBSITE and I was told I would receive $79.32 and $50.00 deposit in two separate checks. So far, I haven't receive one penny from Comcast. I called after that and I spoke in two different occasions to two different representatives and the first told me that they think I didn't return one equipment (the router). I told her that I had the paper indicating the equipment installed in my house and the paper with the equipment returned and they match exactly; for which I got the answer from the manager I spoke to, that I will receive my checks 7 days later. Since that conversation, 9 days had passed and I'm still waiting. I called today, 04/29/14, and the representative told me I have to wait two more weeks. For that reason, I am writing this complaint. Please, if anyone from the government can help me to receive my check, please contact me. Thanks a lot."
"G of Dacula, GA",4/29/2014,,"Increasingly poor service over the last 5 years. Not one person ever honors what they promise. Bill changes every month, no explanation. Most times one can only talk with someone in Asia. Finally, had enough and switched to Direct. Still waiting 3 weeks later for shipping label to return equipment, despite talking with 2 people and sending 3 emails. Each time one deals with Comcast, a very complex phone tree navigation is required, never an option to hit zero and talk with a human. Seems the systems are fragmented and what one CSR can see another cannot. Each call with them costs me at least 30 minutes of my life I won't get back. If there were another internet provider in my area, I would cancel all Comcast service and never do business with them again."
"Claire of Merced, CA",5/2/2014,,"We gave up on Comcast. It has an attitude of a bulldozer. It's too big to care.Original ReviewWe discovered a big jump in our bill and when we called in, we were told the ""promotion"" we're on had been expired. When we decided to cancel Comcast service, we were transferred to ""resolution team"" and the rep offered us a different package that would include higher speed and HBO package. But when we checked again, that offer was a lie and they claimed they could not find the recorded call, in which we were promised the new 'promotion'. After several calls, we realized Comcast had a systematic bait-in-switch marketing ploy that thrives on LIES and deception. None of those reps at Comcast we spoke with had any integrity and they were full of lies. For this reason and other crooked business practices by Comcast, cancelled our business with Comcast. We now know what kind of company Comcast is: the kind that stoop at any low level, including lies, to rob their customers systematically. Comcast also has the worst quality of staff in its customer service department. Most - if not all - ""tech support"" are overseas. They read off the script and promise customers all kind of stuff that never delivered. They told us a technician would be coming the next day, but no one came! And this wasted a lot of our time waiting!"
"Paige  of Fishers , IN",5/5/2014,,I have been dealing with these companies for so long and none of them have really had reasonable prices for the quality of their cable until I switched to DirecTV. I have the number of the representative who set up the deal via promotional based marketing.
"Emily of Indianapolis, IN",5/5/2014,,"I have finally terminated my relationship with Comcast. I have never experienced such poor customer service. After 2 weeks of no television service in March, after multiple time-consuming attempts (read... 2 hours plus spanning multiple days and multiple calls), to reach customer tech support, the company service tech installed an additional signal booster. The technician ASSURED me that the poor signal originated outside our house and HAD BEEN LIKE THAT FOR A LONG TIME, and as such - we would not be charged for the fix..... Unfortunately, this was not the case... The issue was still not resolved and we were charged for the visit, and the equipment. The company THEN insisted it was because of poor wiring inside our house and that the earliest that they could get out to fix OUR problem was the next month and that they would have to rewire at our expense.Strangely, however, Comcast corporate office called me urgently that afternoon and insisted that the issue would be resolved by the end of the day - of course no one called and no more attempts to make contact were made. Today, I gave up - after being charged for two months for no service and a tech visit and a useless signal booster. I will take my business elsewhere. Beware of Comcast. I have filed a complaint with the Indiana Utilities Regulatory Commission and the Better Business Bureau and have signed a petition to stop the attempted merger with Time Warner Cable."
"Mark of Hoffman Estates, IL",5/7/2014,,"My problems started many months ago. It started with my inability to log onto on-demand shows, tech starts by removing the amp(which was installed by another tech) saying I was getting too much signal. This led to my internet going down with amazing regularity BUT on demand worked a little more often. I finally had to plug amp back in to get my internet to work, I would sometimes have to unplug it to get on demand to work. Having lost patience with spending hours and hours on phone to sort this out, I just put up with the bad service for a couple of months till my wife came home from overseas and insisted we do something about the service we were paying so much for.Now my internet has gotten so bad that it goes down 10+ times a day, this takes the phone service out as well and usually on demand. A week ago, a tech comes out, checks all my equipment, and says the problem is outside the house and that he will report it and give it a week and if it was not fixed, call for another appt. To be fair, it did get a tiny bit better, only went down 8+ times a day. O.K., so I made another appt. for today 5/7/14 and it was for 1-3 P.M. They call me around 11:15 to see if they could come early, I told them noon would be just fine and they said they were on their way. Here is where it gets interesting, at 2:30 I get a call asking if anyone were home and that the tech had come and gone. They called again after I told them they were wrong and my wife was home. The last time they called they said nobody was home. I called home and talked to my wife who was at home with 2 dogs (about 200 pounds all told) who do not let anybody walk past the house without very loudly letting us know. On top of that, the garage and front door were both wide open as my wife was going in and out doing front yard work. When I called to complain and tell them that the only answer was their tech was lying, she said she would note this on the account and she promises to get us a tech 1st thing in the morning and after explaining we would not be home the next day, she insisted she would get a tech there. After repeating myself several more time, I asked for a supervisor named Manda, who said only his 1st name was necessary when I asked for his whole name. He then asked me again what my original problem was and said, ""Oh, we will send this to the internet/phone techs"" and they would call me so I wouldn't have to wait on the line. Still waiting. When I asked for credit on my bill for missed appt., he told me I would have to call (and no doubt wait) the billing dept. I (probably stupidly) have been with Comcast for over 15 years and it seems the bigger, more advanced they get, the worse the service gets."
"david of Vacaville, CA",5/8/2014,,"I placed an order to start service at a new address a week ago - they showed up and got it working. It took them 5 hours because of screw ups at the office but it works. At the same time I had another service which I wanted left alone until the 15th but they turned my services off on the 8th. I made 8 calls, spoke to 14 people always getting different excuses and saying we will get you fixed. Still after 4 hours still can't get my internet turned back on. They got the phone back after 2 hours but still not internet after 4 hours. I cannot believe a business ran this badly stays in business. And this is not the only problem I have had over the years - so many I lost count. IF YOU CAN AVOID GETTING COMCAST ANYTHING DO SO."
"Mat of Darien, IL",5/8/2014,,"Been a customer for about 10 yrs or so, and I should be getting 30 mbps down and 5 mbps up. This is what I pay for. Of course on purpose, they will throttle the connection back. I get no more than 1.5 mbps @ 10:30 in the morning!!!! Of all the times I am using internet and I can't get a stable connection because of their throttle back and bottlenecking the speed. I am hoping and waiting for Google Fiber to become available in more areas. I would piss off with Comcast once and for all if I could have a proper reliable internet service who doesn't throttle their connection back. They are shafting us all."
"Michelle of Philadelfia, PA",5/9/2014,,"I urge anyone who has a serious problem with Comcast especially with overcharges or billing fraud to contact the attorney general's office in Pennsylvania TODAY and file a complaint. That is the only way anything will be done about this company. The more people that file a complaint against them the better the chances of the state and government getting involved. But they need to hear from people like you to build a case against Comcast. In addition, more than likely once you report Comcast, they will move mountains to settle your issue. You will then scratch your head in amazement and wonder why it took the AG's office to stir a fire under their butts for them to treat you like a human being and a paying loyal customer when they should have been doing that all along.Going online to warn people and to post your experiences is the right thing to do! I applaud you for that but you need to take it a step further and get the people involved who can do something about Comcast. The payoff in contacting the Attorney General will be in not only finally getting a resolution from Comcast for your own problem but also in knowing that by letting your voice be heard, you had a hand in helping to permanently put a stop to their unfair practices."
"Sam of Katy, TX",5/9/2014,,"I decided to upgrade to X1. I have spoken to someone on the phone and she explained to me that I had to get a triple play package. I went ahead and requested the home security and told the lady that I already had Xfinity alarm before and all they have to do is activate the system. After I made my deal, the Xfinity employee told me that my service would $154 and no additional cost. I just received my 1st bill and it was nearly $500 for the services and fees. I called and I was told that $250 of that was installation fee for my alarm, internet and TV boxes. Wow, how can they install all the equipment that I already have and it's already installed prior to that. The Xfinity lady said she has no answer and she could offer me a free HBO for 3 months. Again I have a freaking HBO already and I just needed them to fix the bill. Xfinity employee would not transfer me to a manager and hung the phone up. Way to go customer service ""Nattalie"". I will be disconnecting their service and I guess I have to give them $500 for something they did not do."
"Carol of Mobile, AL",5/10/2014,,"My bill jumped $42 in April. I called Comcast to see how I could downgrade my service to lower my bill. I was told I had been overcharged and the new lower amount would be on my May bill. May's bill had not been changed. So I called back and after being connected to 5 different people, the rep. understood the problem and worked with me to get the bill down. After the call, the cable wouldn't work on my main t.v. I once again called Comcast. The rep tried to send a signal to restart the box to no avail. I'm writing this on Saturday and can't get a repair crew out here until next Friday. I refuse to take off work to get quicker service since I didn't cause the problem. The rep did say she would knock off $50 plus off my bill. It's pathetic when you call to change your service and end up with no service at all. This is not the first time I've had with Comcast."
"F of New Haven, CT",5/13/2014,,"I had no other cable options but Comcast. When I moved again, I was so happy to get rid of Comcast. I canceled the service in October. They have absolutely no record of my cancellation. I continued to be billed and ended up overpaying, because I hadn't realized my service was not canceled. I continued to be billed up to 6 months later. I have spoken to dozen of services representatives and ""supervisors"". Long story short, they owe me $66 and have yet to give me MY money back. I should have been done dealing with Comcast 6 months ago!!!!!!!!!"
"angela of Knoxville, TN",5/13/2014,,"I switched from Dish to Comcast about 2 weeks ago. The day the technician hooked up everything, it didn't work so he was on the phone. He had been with the company for 30 years. He had no clue so finally he tells me they are having issues in Nashville which is almost 3 hours away so I said, ""Why would that matter?"" Long story short, it hasn't worked. 3 people have come and still nothing but I've gotten a $200 bill already."
"Krissy of Fort Lauderdale, FL",5/15/2014,,"My feedback on Comcast/Xfinity is that it sucks!!!!! The customer service is horrible, and nobody seems to know what they are doing. I was on live chat with a girl earlier today and she literally took 6-7 minutes in between each question that I asked her only to come back not answering the question at all. I got so frustrated with her that I disconnected with her and called in. The people in the billing department were just as rude and horrible. I was told since I got your service in December that my installation fee of $66.50 was only for 3 months which I paid and it shows that on my paper. However, today a lady told me that she don't know who told me that because my installation for $66.50 is for 6 months. Like WHERE THE HELL did that come from? After arguing back and forth with her I decided to do what was best and CANCEL my services. I can't keep dealing with LIES from Comcast representatives/Comcast in general. Not only are they RUDE but NO ONE seems to know what they are doing!!!!!! OH AND DID I SAY RUDE, RUDE, RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND BILLING DEPARTMENT!"
"mofan of Silver Spring, MD",5/16/2014,,"I moved into apartment and called Comcast for setting up internet. They told me the old tenant didn't disconnect the account and I had to wait. It's totally not my fault and why I have to wait for such a long time. Before that, whenever I called the local service, the reply were always voice mail box. And I sent about ten emails but only got one reply."
"Dale of Jacksonville, FL",5/17/2014,,"I have repeatedly tried to use the Xfinity numerous times. The service is very, very unstable, with one exception: the commercials play flawlessly. Must be nice to be a monopoly. In case you haven't realized already, I DESPISE Comcast."
"Robert of Ocean City, NJ",5/19/2014,,"I was moving from my apartment in January of 2009 and moving into my girlfriend's house. I did not need my Comcast account any more, but my landlord wanted to continue the account so I went to transfer the account to his name. I took my cable box and we met at the Comcast office. I turned in the box and started the transfer. She then said that I had a second cable box, but I did not. She looked at the records and said that she could see I was only being billed for only one, but that there was a second one linked to the account. She said it was on the account for a couple years and installed in the Lounge (I did not have a lounge. It was a 1 room apartment). She said it must have been an error and suggested I contact Comcast. She could not close or transfer the account until this box was resolved.I called Comcast and explained the situation. I told them that there was a box on my account that I never had and was never billed for. They said they would look into it. About a week later, I bounced a check. The reason was that they back billed me for this non-existent box which came directly out of my bank account (something I won't do again). I called Comcast and I was told that instead of an investigation for an obvious error that they would send out a technician to inspect the house to verify that there was no extra cable box. The tech came out and verified that there was no second box.I called Comcast and spoke to Jessika and she said that the box was removed and a credit was given. My landlord had decided to continue the cable so we went together to switch the account over to him. When I did, I was informed that the box was still listed on the account and that I will be billed for it until it is taken off. I called Comcast again and was told an investigation would have to be done and that the investigation would be completed within a week. I called Comcast again and spoke to Ron. He said the investigation said that I was still responsible for the box and until I can prove that I do not have the box, which is impossible, that I cannot get this off my account.Ron asked me to provide as much information about the issue. I even included a letter from my landlord. Ron told me that they would open another investigation. Another week passed. I get a call from Ron saying that he is happy to tell me that after review of my case, it was decided all I had to do was turn in the cable box that doesn't exist and they will take it off my account.I asked Ron some questions about the box. I told him that I was told it was supposed to have been installed in the lounge. If so, when was it installed? Ron said that on March 22, 2007 a technician was dispatched to install the phantom second box. I said ok, if a tech was dispatched, I want to see the paperwork. He put me on hold and after about 30 minutes he came back and said he was mistaken, it was not installed by a technician. It was a self-install and was mailed by UPS. I said, ""Great, you will then have a tracking number and a signature. I want to see it."" I was then put on hold again for some time, then Ron came back and said he was mistaken again, it was shipped by US postal service. I know that cable boxes are addressable. I asked him if that box had ever been activated in my area. He said there were no records of it ever been activated. I told him, ""You do not have any paperwork ever linking me to this box. It was never used at my location and I was never billed for it for several years (I started being billed after the error was found)."" He said that I was correct on all accounts. I asked him, ""What does all that evidence show?"" He said ""That I need to turn in the cable box in order to resolve the problem."" I lost control and started yelling at him. I think I called him every name I could think of. Since I was at work when this call came in, everyone in the cubicle farm heard me screaming at this guy. Ron was calm throughout the call. In the end, he told me that I have used up all my reviews and that there is nothing else I can do. (Remember, I have moved out by this time. I still have to pay for cable I am not using and pay for a box I do not have). I asked if I can just buy the non-existing box. I was told no. I asked if there was any way to close my account and just be billed for the box. I was told no. I have to have pay for cable until I return the non-existent box. He said that unless I turn in the non-existent box, I will be billed until the end of time.I ended the call unsure of what else to do. Luckily, someone that heard me screaming at the guy, came over to my cubicle. She said that her mother was a supervisor and she would see what she could do for me. The next day, I was told the box was removed from my account and that I could now close it. After all the frustration, cost and aggravation, all it took was a couple keystrokes that no one else was willing to do. Their service is usually good, but when there is a problem it seems it is always a nightmare. I also have to deal with Comcast for data services at my job. I could fill up pages of problems that take months to get resolved. The problem isn't really the service. It is the people and the policies that make it such a problem."
"Mary of Indianapolis, IN",5/21/2014,,"I stopped Comcast two years ago because I was promised one price. When the bill came it was much bigger than promised. I called and was told the representative didn't note it down. I told them it needed to be fixed. I didn't owe that amount. After three months of promises not met, I cut off their service. I had my service when they were changing all the digital stuff and they had sent me several boxes to do the switch with. When I cut the service off I returned what I thought was the right box. The customer service lady wouldn't give me a receipt and when I demanded she do so she threw it at me. I tried dealing with them on the bill I didn't owe so contacted the Attorney General's office. I was then contacted by a lady from corporate. She said I didn't owe anything and everything was taken care of. I wanted to make sure I never had to deal with them again so I searched around my house to make sure I had returned everything since they had sent me so many different boxes I didn't need. I did find another box and returned it. They told me it was in their system as stolen (wow the lady from corporate that said all was fine was not being honest). They did take it back and gave me a receipt for it. A few months later I got a letter from a collection agency it had my name and address but someone else's social security number on the letter. I turned it all into the Attorney General's Office and that was that. Now two years later, I got a letter from a collection agency with all my info but the same amount that was on the bogus letter with someone else's social security number, only this time it was mine. I am so sick of these people. No one can get anything straight. You get shuffled around on the phone. They say you owe nothing and will not stop trying to collect. I refuse to pay for someone else's bills. Never chose this company."
"Richard of Atlanta, GA",5/21/2014,,"OMG... this company is a joke! Comcast actually makes ATT look good... How is that possible since ATT is the worse run company in America... until now... Congratulations Comcast. You have the worse customer service in the world... The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing... I have been jerked around for 3 weeks trying to open my new business, and kept getting different answers from different people. They made appointment to install, then installer said he could do it, and someone else would come out. Customer service kept giving me different stories. They want $12,000 and 90 days to connect... WTF... What is this, the 1960s? What are they using to dig with, A SPOON!!! Get your act together... This company is way behind the times. AVOID>>>AVOID>>>AVOID.... Pick any company over COMCAST... You will be disappointed with Comcast... TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE!!"
"Erin of El Dorado Hills, CA",5/22/2014,,"I had an erroneous charge on my bill for a Pay Per View that I did not order. It was on the date I had the television service installed. I was told someone ordered a Pay Per View fight that cost $80. I explained to customer service that we had just moved in on that date and that during the time frame in question we were busy moving and that no one ordered it. I was told the first time that someone watched it for 44 minutes, and then the second customer service rep said someone in my household watched it for 56 minutes. I again reiterated that I did not order it and asked that the erroneous charge be removed from my bill, but they refused. In addition, when the service was set up the tech turned on all the T.V.'s, left them on and did not explain how to use the remotes. He could have charged it for all I know."
"D'Andrea of Nashville, TN",5/22/2014,,"I have had nothing but problems with Comcast from the beginning my services started up until the present. I have cable, home security, and Internet services with them. My thermostat from the home security was faulty from the beginning at least three techs were sent out. Each was supposed to put in a new thermostat box. They said it was replaced but it wasn't. How I know that, is because we had been painting and there was a small drop of paint on the box. Not big enough to damage it in any way. When the third or fourth tech came out was only then that I got a new box. My cameras from the home security would often go out and have to be reset, which many times wouldn't resolve the issue. When call Comcast to get my bill prorated for the times they were out, nothing was deducted from my bill and when I suspect a business worker may have stolen from me the cameras were still not working. Now I have a monthly bill that keeps getting higher and higher a month. I have tried to call Comcast several times to just get a cheaper rate on my bill. I am not trying to disconnect any services - I just want a cheaper rate! I am on constant hold with customer service. Then I get disconnected from the rep and they never (!) call back after having my information. I then have to call back. Then I get transferred from department to department often times than not without warning and with no assistance to resolve my issue at all. When I finally got someone on the line, I was told that I will have to pay an $800.00 early termination fee from home security just to get a cheaper rate on my bill. Again, not trying to disconnect any services, I just want a cheaper rate on my monthly bill. Why can't I do that without being penalized for it! I don't have any premium channels and paying over $200 a month. Will someone help this very angry unsatisfied customer?"
"Dennis of Kent, WA",5/23/2014,,"Ordered Comcast on April 28th internet and television. Quote was $116.00 a month for the first year. Comcast mailed a defective box for a $15.00 self install. I called tech support and they sent out a tech guy who simple replaced their defective box. I was told by the Comcast technician, there would be no extra charge for this call. Next, an email arrives saying my monthly bill will be $220.00 per month. I called their billing department, am told the email is wrong and my actual bill is going to be $127.79 per month.A month later, an email arrives and tells me I am being billed $320.00. Called their billing department and was told this was for April 28 until the end of June. That is 2 months and 3 days. The $15.00 self install morphed into a $92.00 service call. I asked for a supervisor and was told there was none available but I would receive a call back today. Of course that never happened. My days are numbered at Comcast."
"Mark of Somerset, MA",5/23/2014,,"The services from Comcast are overall pretty good. I get high speed internet, cable tv, and phone from them. The bad thing about Comcast is the inconsistency with their knowledge of their own products and the handling of any issues that might arise. I am above average when it comes to electronics and connecting things. If someone is totally ignorant as to what is needed for optimal performance, then Comcast could be a horror show. Sometimes an operator or a technician who comes to the house are very good at what they do, and at other times you can get stuck with a complete moron. My personal experience was fortunate because most of the people I dealt with were knowledgeable. I know there are many negative reviews but I think there is a problem with every provider from across the country no matter what the brand."
"William of Fort Myers, FL",5/23/2014,,"Comcast continues to prove that they have the worst Customer Support of any company on the planet. Having to phone them for any issue is complete mental torture as well as at least a half a day lesson in futility. My latest call yesterday was after I was convinced I needed to replace my modem which was working perfectly fine. I couldn't get any of my devices to activate so after a 30-minute wait, their wonderful Filipino call center came on, asked the standard security questions and put me on hold only to disconnect me. I called back a second time, only to solve the problem on my own after another 30-minute wait.This is SO TYPICAL of the absurd, untrained customer service call centers that they utilize. My greatest hope is that everyone that has experienced the same torture (which must be anyone who has called them) would switch services and once and for all give this giant what they deserve, a nice trip to bankruptcy court. Who is running this company? Don't they have any idea that businesses are built on Customer Service? Maybe they should go to lunch with Richard Anderson from Delta Airlines so he can teach them how to treat customers and build loyalty. Comcast, you should be ashamed of yourselves!"
"Jennifer of Hermitage, TN",5/23/2014,,"Everything from installation to billing... I should have known when the first tech never showed up that I should have gone with a different company. After that it was and has been a total nightmare! Being billed twice as much as promised to cable boxes not working and being replaced 5-6 times, premium channels being removed every other day, internet working off and on every other day. Wifi never stays connected. When the bill is ""adjusted, and I am told what to pay and go pay it and the difference is still there the next month and I call the rep tells me to pay it because I should not listen to anything anyone tells me to pay. WHAT?!?! Ok so I am over billed and I get an adjustment but I should still pay it? OK!!!! Or he also told me to pay it because it ""is still on the ledger"" Wow, just wow!!! I have had my router/modem replaced a couple times. I have to reboot my modem daily to get my internet to work. When I signed up it was for the triple play at $119.99 WITH a prepaid Visa card. Now not even 6 months later and after speaking to Corporate several times over many many issues, too many to list here AND a complaint to the Tennessee Regulatory Authority, I am now told I am not in a contract so there is no prepaid Visa rewards card on my account. I am in shock!!! First what company lures you in with a promotional package price even without a prepaid Visa card without a contract? I was quoted a 2 year contract at $119.99 a month then after 12 months the price goes up to $139.99. I guess I am making this up in my head, at least Comcast would like people to believe. So it is a case of bait and switch. If they claim I am in no contract they can legally deny me the Visa card. There is no way to speak to anyone of actual authority at Comcast, just reps who handles escalations. Even when promised a lousy $20 credit on my account I did not get it because the note was not found. I see complaint after complaint about Comcast online especially about the Visa prepaid cards. How are they getting away with their deceitful practices?"
"Karen of Wasco, IL",5/24/2014,,"In November of 2013, we switched to Comcast for internet and phone due to AT&T's high price. Installer (sub-contractor) came out late in the day and not happily puttered around outside in the cold and dark. Everything seemed fine. Within 24 hours, the internet continually went off as well as the phone. New guy came out two days later, did something outside and inside; same scenario. This went on for months. As we were out of town for a few weeks at a time during the long harsh winter, I couldn't call them every day to tell them about outages, but people said our phone didn't work, so it was out. Workers came out at least 4 more times even switching modems for which I was charged! By April, I'd had enough only to find an inflated bill for ""trouble calls"" to fix an installation that was never properly installed. Worst. Company. Ever."
"brian of Woodstock, GA",5/25/2014,,"We do not use or want cable services. We use over the air HDTV and my children watch movies and cartoons on Netflix. We have had Comcast high speed internet for years. They have called and called trying to get us to add cable to our home and we have told them that we do not want or need cable. So now they call us and say they are limiting the amount of data we use because we use Netflix and not their cable service and said they will be charging extra money for data we use for Netflix. In my area, Comcast is the only true fast internet available so to me this seems illegal, i.e., monopolizing the market, bullying good customers."
"C. B. of Mt. Prospect, IL",5/27/2014,,"We bought a small business. It is primary wholesale and our customers need to reach us by phone daily. The previous owners used Comcast, and I set forth to do the same. I asked to retain the same phone number but obtain a new account number. The salesman on 4.22.14 said no problem.... that was the first lie. Here we are now on 5.27 with interrupted phone service as Comcast ""accidentally"" turned off the old # instead of porting it to our new equipment. The helpless center said they could have someone turn it back on no earlier than 6.4. What are we supposed to do in the meantime, lose our business? Further, even Comcast couldn't reach us to tell us a tech couldn't show up over Memorial day weekend... Why? Because our phones don't work... and they weren't smart enough to call the cell phone alternatives we have attached to our account. We will undoubtedly suffer huge financial loss while they figure out how to get their act together. We have already spent countless hours on the phone rehashing our story daily. They have not even offered reimbursement of services. This is the most ridiculous excuse for customer service. They should not be allowed to provide service to businesses."
"Robert of Bridgeview, IL",5/27/2014,,"I use (only) Comcast internet and I have been for years. Most of the time it works fine and in the past when it cut out on me, Comcast fixed it remotely within a day (sometimes within hours of a call to tech support). This past Tuesday (5/20), however, when I tried to watch Netflix, I discovered the modem had stopped working. Without going into great detail, a technician arrived Saturday (5/24) and found that the wires in the box outside had been cut: the tech blamed it on Dish Network.Anyway, when service was restored, I found emails from Comcast that told me about the $30 charge for the technician visit. I was always under the impression that Comcast only charged for a tech visit if the problem turned out to that of the user - indeed, calls to tech support in years past informed me of exactly that - not if something went wrong outside. I called Comcast and they refused to get rid of it.Even worse, Comcast sent me notices January 2013 that I had to upgrade my modem: they were jacking up the speed (which can be taken as 'we are going to jack up the price') and I needed a new modem to handle it. Okay, fine, I bought a Surfboard 6141 (Comcast approved), installed it, returned the old modem, then called Comcast to give them the new MAC address. They accepted it and activated the modem in March 2013, and it has worked 99.5% of the time since then; until 5/21 when someone cut the wires outside.Comcast has been charging me rental fees for my own modem since March 2013, and they knew I had my own modem because I had to give them the MAC address so they could activate it. When I called about this, Comcast basically blamed me for not looking at my bill and telling them they were still charging me. Not only do I have to give them the MAC address, they can't read it remotely? But I have to inform the billing department?Despite the hassle of no internet service, tech support, and tech visits, I really never had a problem with Comcast. Modems and wires are mechanical and can fail (or be cut), and all tech visits in recent memory (at least until the current one) got canceled because the problem was resolved remotely. But this is something else: support charges? Leasing my own modem? I told the billing person: I am angry and disappointed and what you did was not cool in any way. This morning I read Comcast is spending $40 million lobbying the FCC so they can charge even more, a fact that caused me to remove the check mark down there about an attorney: no one has enough money to deal with this. Most galling is I have to continue using Comcast for internet service, as I have no other options."
"DJ of Dolton, IL",5/28/2014,,"Comcast first contacted me in 2011 via a resume on CareerBuilder, about an CAE position (customer service rep), at the time I was looking for work and was interested in the position. They had a three step, interview process, the last being a face to face interview with the a facility mgr or supervisor. However, after completing the first two steps, WITH FLYING COLORS, it was ""strongly suggested to me"" that if I had any outstanding bills, I should resolve that matter, before I would be allowed to complete the hiring process and start training, this was for the Woodridge, Illinois call center. The reason I had an outstanding bill was because of a dispute with Comcast to begin with. Well, here we go, I paid the bill because I was told I will be getting my training class, start date. That was in may of 2011, still waiting on that email! Well I never got the job, but like an idiot, I set up cable and phone service for $50.00 a month, because I transfer large files for an internet radio station. First bill as promised $50.00 plus taxes and fees, total $55-57 or so, I don""t really remember the exact amount. The next month, $60.00, the next month $69.00, the next month $75.00, etc, etc, etc!!! Each month my bill went up by about $10!! Each month I had to call customer service to correct this problem, by getting a credit put on my account as opposed to just billing me the amount I agreed to when I set up service. Needless to say, this got very old very fast! Luckily I was under no contract, but the CSR's would ask me was I ordering pay per view, ah no, I don't have cable service just phone and internet, are you calling overseas, ah no, the rep told me it was cheaper to order the bundle for $50 as oppose to just internet for $75 dollars. I had a cell phone, besides I don't know anyone overseas. I don't make outbound calls on the Comcast phone, except maybe to Pizza Hut once and a while. No keep in mind my bill was suppose to be $50 a month for as long as I had the service, (NO CONTRACT, you can cancel at anytime said the sales rep) Comcast prorate the first bill and charge you for the next month ahead of time, that's what it said on my online account!! So I got fed up, with having to call in each month to keep from being over charged. So I got me last credit, paid my $50 bill and cancelled my service. Two weeks later I get a final bill, in the mail for $125.00 charging me for the last 1 1/2 of service that I already paid for!! Remember they charge a month ahead of time. I thought I would owe nothing on the last bill, seeing how I paid for this month, last month, but to close the account I had to pay the balance due and wait on a Comcast credit refund? Well I got it, a collection agency hounding me for this $125.00 they say I owe Comcast, when I called Comcast, waited an hour to speak to a rep, who looked at each bill, quoted me what I paid and then quoted me the final bill, saying ""You owe $125.00"" HOW??? I paid in advance, its right on your website!! Let me speak to a supervisor, who did the exact same thing, did not and could not explain how they came to that total, just that the computer says I owe $125.00 for my final bill for the last 1 & 1/2 months of service, that I had payment conformations on!! Sent them a screen shot, conformation numbers. The $125.00 is still in collections! But the killer is they have called me five times to come interview with them again (well I have to be honest, Manpower, recruits for Comcast) I actually went in tow weeks ago, for the interview and yes I have passed the first step again. Scheduled to go back on the 2nd of June to do the face to face. I just called the to ** Client Services Partner, Talent Acquisition Comcast person who ran the first interview. Oh by way this position, is in the billing dept. Currently there is a 43min wait to speak to a rep, I told her , and she said, and I quote ""What do you want me to do? You haven't even had your fact to face yet!"" What difference does that make I asked!! This is what I sent to her email and surprise I got no reply back! Please remove my name from contingency for employment with Comcast (but I'm sure you've already done that given the attitude you displayed on the phone). It should not matter whether or not I have had a face to face interview with your organization, whether I'm a current or former customer, you being an executive, at least that's my understanding, resolving a customers issue, should still have a level of importance, seeing how you are still an agent of the corporation. Comcast has thousands of negative reviews online. Negative reviews about the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings. Not to mention the outstanding bill I have, is due to Comcast's error. You came across to me during the brief phone conversation, like I am a deadbeat and just did not want to pay. Well here's a news flash, I'm not paying for the same service twice. In any of my CSR's positions, that I have held for over 25 years, whether it was my dept or not, if I get the call, I will try and resolve the issue. But that's just me, I don't believe in passing the buck. But that appears to be Comcast motto and you appear to be NO DIFFERENT. I am also going to post a copy of this email and the circumstances on the web. I think people should know how Comcast recruiters feel about the customers. I would have thought you would try and set the example, of good customer service, seeing how you recruit and train customer service reps. Maybe that's why Comcast sucks so badly and is so mismanaged."
"dee of Chicago, IL",5/28/2014,,"After my Internet stopped working, I called Comcast. They told me to buy a new modem, which I did ($85). Still no wi-fi. A dozen of calls later--more than half of them dropped by Comcast--I still don't have my wi-fi, AND I am out of $85. Comcast ""supervisor"" has finally told me to go out and buy a new router ($119), but they wouldn't mend the lapse in service to date. The apparent lack of care in ""customer care"" is really disconcerting. It is like they literally don't care. And I have been a customer for ten years! Can Comcast's abusive, incompetent, rude, and shameless ""customer service"" degrade any further?"
"Sulakshana of Jacksonville, FL",5/29/2014,,"I have Comcast internet and Dish TV (I use Dish because I watch Indian Channels) in my home and called Comcast to add TV and bundle up my service so I could save. Following is what happened next: I called Comcast and the person on the other side talked slow and just kept repeating what I was saying, and when I asked her to transfer me to another rep, she kept me on hold for 40 mins just to get even. I hung up and called a local area code number of my city provided by Comcast (904 374 8000) on May 27th to inquire if they provided Indian Channels (Zee TV, Star, Life OK and Sony) so I could bundle up my services to save... and the sales person on the phone asked me about weather. On my surprise (Why would you ask me that if you are in my city), she said she was in Atlanta. Why would a person call a 904 number and be routed to a call center in another city.Moving on she mentioned that the best package to bundle my services was at $99 and the ""DESI 4-PACK"" was another $30 and I would be billed at $131. Also there would be an extra $10 (approx) for my second TV. To my surprise today they installed my connection and the ""Desi 4 Pack"" was not even there in my area. ANDâ€¦ I am being billed for Activation/Installation and my bill online says $228.97On calling them back a rep (Rep ID: **) kept repeating ""Itâ€™s not in your package BUT you are not being charged either"". Seriously?? I stay at home all day waiting for the installation. I spent 39 mins and again 27 mins yesterday to even get the info and subscribe and then call back again for 40 mins today only to find out that the service promised isn't even there in my area AND I'm being charged $280? And the equipment is all scratched up. I added an image here too."
"Stephen of The Villages, FL",5/29/2014,,"Absolutely the worst customer service. Made appointments they did not honor. Obtuse and impossible to get through to customer complaints. Totally frustrating. I would never use their ""service"" in the future. They are the poster child for run around. Buyer beware. Minus five out of five."
"Maureen of Jupiter, FL",5/29/2014,,"I called today to discontinue my Telephone, Internet and Cable TV services with Comcast. I am moving my services to ATT&T. The new company could not set up my telephone services because Comcast had not released the telephone number. I called Comcast to discontinue my services and was told this was not possible because they were in the process of moving the telephone number which would take about a week to ten days. I currently cannot receive any telephone calls on my landline because of this situation. Also I am paying Comcast for a service I am not receiving. When I asked to speak with a supervisor at Comcast I was disconnected. I have called Comcast four times over this problem."
"Shawn of Reading, PA",5/30/2014,,Had a tech. Supervisor come with reg tech for a long time issue after they left all but one of my five TVs were not working and the Customer service jerk would rather ague with me than send tech. Said that there are NO tech available after telling me that he could if my issue was more serious. If you have a choice DO NOT USE THIS GARBAGE COMPANY! Once again we regular people are victims of MONOPOLY COMPANIES. Just like Airlines. There is your Big Government at work. These Corp. no doubt have to have our leaders in their pocket. Just try and get Good Service and Good Customer Service.
"Lisa of Baltimore, MD",5/31/2014,,"Yesterday, after holding for over an hour to contact technical support for assistance, an original appt was schedule for 6/2/14 however I requested an appointment for TODAY, thus the technician stated he will advise his supervisor to update the scheduled appointment for TODAY. The technician confirm my appointment for TODAY!!! However, when I contact customer service, I was laughed at, kept getting ""I apologize"", but no resolution. A lead representative had the audacity to say ""technical calls are always scheduled in my area at that time & day"". Let's just say I took offense to that comment, on top of the snickering and laughter in the background as I am trying to get some resolution. Direct TV is beginning to look better."
"Stephanie of Portland, OR",5/31/2014,,"I'm not sure what to say about this company, so what I will say is that this company is a scam and I will NEVER work with them again. Additionally, I would recommend that no one else work with them because they will scam you and because we need better options in this country for a non-monopoly service that has become a necessity within our society (internet options).I have been with Comcast for many many years. They have pushed my bill through many levels of monetary values and have not held up to their promise to keep it consistent. Each month, my bill jumps from the low hundreds to above $300. This is not acceptable for customer service, which after a heated phone call with them, is apparent that they do not have. They have been calling my phone several times per day for the past week, without leaving messages. I finally took their call to find out that if I pay them $300 + dollars they are happy to keep me as a customer (last thing I heard from them is that the bill should be $106). This is not acceptable, this is not good business, this is not acceptable customer service."
"Kristy of Cordova, TN",6/3/2014,,"I requested to have home phone service / internet service transferred to my new address. Tech was out yesterday to install phone/internet service. Several hours after service was installed my alarm system went off and wouldn't stop (all night). I contacted Comcast to advise them of this issue. I was placed on hold for over 10 mins to get nothing resolved. I called again to get my issue addressed and was asked how long had I been a customer.. (not sure what that has to do with anything). I ask for a credit for my inconvenience and was told I would receive for the days without phone service. I guess I will have to foot the bill for the alarm company ""false calls"" minutes used on my cell phone. I spoke with a lead and a mgr that transferred me to another dept (not sure why). This has got to be the WORST company ever..... I'm glad I spoke with Jenny and she was glad to help me.. I'm still not sure when or if my phone service will be repaired."
"Hollie of Flat Rock, MI",6/3/2014,,"Too long of a story to explain, first of all someone should file a class action law suit! They lie about the cost of your package bundle, every month the cost goes up! They love to slam their customers with high late fees. Try to get a hold of customer service? If you can get someone who you can understand? All customer service agents have heavy foreign languages. It took me over an hour to get a hold of someone, then they leave you on hold over and over again. They also like to hang up so you have to spend another hour getting a hold of someone. This place turned into an absolute nightmare. I have been with them for 10 years and I cannot believe how awful their services are!!! Be cautious, look out for outrageous bills and non-stop trouble with their internet services."
"Jackie of Silver Spring, MD",6/3/2014,,"What a terrible experience. I signed up for the internet plus plan since I only needed internet and they had a special promotion running. I scheduled the install, no problem that same week, however when the technician arrived and looked around, he told me that he would not be able to install because Verizon (my current service) cut the underground wires needed. I called to see how soon the underground team could come out and was told in a week and a half. I explained that I could not wait so long because I had already provided Verizon with a termination date. SO the guy on the phone said ok, soonest we can come out is one week. I agreed and received a confirmation. That day comes for the second attempt to install and the technician tells me the underground team only marked the area where the wire would go so he could not install. Why would Comcast have the underground team only mark the area and allow me to reschedule the install for the next day if they knew no wires were actually put in?I called immediately and cancelled the service. Then yesterday, the underground team came to my house and put all the wires in which was obvious because my front lawn was destroyed. I called to complain and ask why this was done, if I had already cancelled. Ashley from Comcast told me that they were going to come out anyways because our wiring was messing with another connection in the neighborhood. I then asked, well, what if a utility pipe was damaged since all the markers were removed since I had cancelled, she responded that I would have to submit a damage claim. I'm so over Comcast. I will NEVER again attempt to work with Comcast. Would rather pay Verizon the higher prices since I receive such great service. Do not be fooled by the special promotions. THEY ARE TERRIBLE."
"Joan of Charles Town, WV",6/3/2014,,"I had Internet service activated at my residence in my name in April of 2014. The first bill I received in April was a shut off notice for lack of payment. I made SEVEN phone calls over the span of three hours explaining that my son had service at my residence up until that point, but he moved and took service with him, so I had only had the account for one month and could not be past due. They never resolved my issue. The next bill I received was for past due charges as well, but when I called to make my payment and take up the argument again, I was told it was only $26 due. I assumed they finally resolved my account issues and I asked the Comcast representative several times if she was sure that was all I owed and if my account was fixed and I was advised that yes it was. On May 29, when I got home from work, I could not log in to Comcast online because it said my account was disconnected due to non payment. I then called Comcast and spent an hour and a half on the phone trying to resolve why my account had a zero balance due, yet they disconnected my service. No one was able to provide me with an answer, but they stated they would have it reconnected on June 2. I asked the Comcast representative several times if she was sure no one needed to be home and she stated they had to only reconnect at the pole and no house access was required. On June 2, I received a call at my place of employment from the Comcast technician, stating he could not connect my service without gaining access to my home. On the evening of June 2, I again stayed on the phone for an hour and a half, 30 minutes of which was in attempts to speak with a supervisor whom I was never connected to. So my Internet services were disconnected for no apparent reason, I have wasted four and a half hours on my cell phone using 270 minutes of call time."
"Amin of Allston, MA",6/4/2014,,"I am a client of Comcast Business Internet for the past 4 years. A couple of days ago, they performed a migration from Microsoft Exchange 2007 to Microsoft Exchange 2010. They sent me an email stating that this migration will be performed on Sat night 11pm to 7am Sun (May 31, 2014 to June 1, 2014) at which time my internet services will be interrupted. However, when the service was resumed on Sunday night (much later than they said in their email), I found that they had changed my server address (which ends in comcast.net). This change in server address had a drastic effect on my Business Contact Manager within MS Outlook. It literally made it impossible for me to access my list of business contacts and their information. Over the past 4 years, I had built a list of 2,250 email subscribers and my whole business is dependent on this list. I have called their technical support list for several times now and their reps keep saying they have passed this ticket to their Tier 2 tech and they will be calling me. But I have not heard a word from Comcast's Tier 2 tech support. I feel I've been sidelined and abandoned. They created a big problem for me with this migration and now they don't want to assist in resolving this matter. Almost all of the Comcast reps I have spoken to seem to be passing the buck, claiming the problem is with me or with Microsoft.I wish these tech reps at Comcast will stop dilly dallying and get back to me promptly to resolve this huge problem that they had created due to their negligence. They failed to consider the consequences on changing the server settings on the Business Contact Manager in MS Outlook of their clients. What is really frustrating for me is that no one from their Tier 2 tech support called me up to now. Today is the 3rd day I am waiting. They just kept me waiting like they don't care. On the other hand, I am so anxious and desperate that I restraint myself from going to the bathroom as I don't want to miss their call. I am even eating my meals at the computer table so I don't miss the call from them. They have put me in so much stress for the past 3 days and they seem like they just don't care."
"Jayne of Margate, NJ",6/4/2014,,"What happen - this has been a nightmare for months. I am still waiting for reps to call me back. I have called over 25 times. Each time I call, no one sees my former complaint. I have to start all over again. No one ever calls me back. No one can ever help me. I have been getting charged for equipment and packages I did not ask for. I am owed Credits - and they refuse to give them to me. BEWARE AND DO NOT GET COMCAST. They lie to you!! They change your package without you knowing. Do not choose Comcast. You will need another job to pay for their service - they are thieves!! Customer service reps are trained to rip you off! They add to bill without your consent. They work off commission! Someone need to start a class action lawsuit!! I am owed hundreds of dollars for being lied to and charged for service I did not have. "
"Christine of Tinley Park, IL",6/5/2014,,"I recently had a technician out to my home to work on my service, which is spotty at best, and he mentioned that I was being charged $8 a month for the modem in my home. The problem is that I own my modem, I always have. I was told that the charges had started 2 years ago and that I would be refunded the $184.00 that had been mistakenly added to my bill. Customer service was horrible. It has now been a week, and a supervisor called tonight to tell me that I should have told them of the error earlier and I was entitled to a refund for the past 60 days..$16.00, in the form of a credit only. In a perfect world I would have caught the mistake, but of course I was on auto-pay and didn't notice a slight increase in my bill (considering how inconsistent it always was). I have been a customer for years and they were not even slightly apologetic. The supervisor actually called me to explain to me that it was my fault and therefore I wasn't entitled to a full refund. She was honestly surprised that I didn't agree with her. I have already signed up with a main competitor and can't wait to cancel this service. I will never go back to them and I will spread the word to keep a strict eye on your bill... they take NO responsibility for their errors."
"Janet of Lynn Haven, FL",6/6/2014,,"So far this company holds the award for the poorest customer service I have ever received. I started 3 weeks ago attempting to get cable service from them and each time I called for 3 calls, they said a work order did not exist. I tried to give them a confirmation number and they said ""that doesn't mean anything."" My boyfriend took over because he is not living in our new house. He calls daily and has heard that they first have to verify our house exists (neighbors on both sides have comcast), they do not yet have a work order entered (what is it with you people that you just hang up the phone and do NOTHING), and they have no idea when someone can come out. This is absolutely unbelievable. Must be nice to have pretty much a monopoly. I never worked in an industry that could offer service this poor and survive."
"Dennis of St. Augustine, FL",6/6/2014,,"I'm not sure why I am bothering, but you should at least file this complaint. I'm sure with many like it. As a two-account subscriber, I have just been put through the ringer by your staff (mostly in India). On May 2, 2014 we received 3 letters stating that we were going to lose channels because we had a certain level of service, Basic HD, (which we didn't). We had a XF Preferred Double Play. Signed-up in October 2013.When I called to inquire about the letters, I got a very hard to understand rep named Louis. He frustrated me so bad with his broken English and lack of comprehension, I asked for a supervisor. Monica enters the fray. While not much better, at least (as I thought) we were making progress. She offered us a package for our inconvenience $50 less than what we were paying. It was also a Triple Play instead of a Double Play. We were forced to get a phone modem but still a lower rate. No such luck. This was the first lie. Our service was downgraded to basic and we lost MANY important channels. And, Monica told us that any room DVR meant you could physically take the DVR to any room. Really?On-line I spoke with Adrian then his supervisor Mdrizwan. He didn't comprehend the problem either. I finally terminated the online Chat. Our service remained basic and this time NO DVR. To increase frustration, during the NFL draft, we could not access because they cut the NFL channel. Our next call was to an English speaking rep by the name of Michele. She signed us up to a package for $166.94 plus tax. Sounded good, right? Wrong. No service change but we got tagged a $2.99 service change and an installation charge of $2.99. Our next call was to Karen in Michigan. Surely she could help. Well we got our service back and a bill that went from $192 to $233.Today, 6 June 2014, we talked to Charlie, Paul and Roy, all Indian. Roy was with the retention and billing division. NO HELP! He kept trying to up our service rate to $202. While he apologized profusely, he didn't offer to return our service to the $192 rate we were now willing to go back to and call it a day. After arguing with him about what was and what wasn't the correct rate, we hung up.Bottom line: COMCAST has lost a customer with two accounts. ATT U-verse will likely be the beneficiary of this gross incompetence and Bait and Switch tactics. I am thoroughly disgusted with COMCAST. I will go to the Internet with this story. And that is a promise! No Bait and Switch here!"
"Richard of Richland, MI",6/6/2014,,"Ordered the TV & Internet double package that I received from Xfinity mailer promotion. When installer arrived, he had been given a different order to install incorrect boxes and service. Some of this problem was corrected while he was doing the install, however after installation, I found I was billed way above the quoted costs. After 3 1/2 hours on the phone with 8 different representatives, I was still not given the package that was advertised and now 2 of the receiver boxes continue to drop signal. I am averaging 11/2 hour per day trying to get this corrected. My internet speed is not the speed I was told I would receive. I tried to replace one of the receivers that is dropping and was sent a box that was not what I ordered. Customer service reps seem to be of no help and only answer any question by reading their prepared texts. Now I find that pending charges exceed quoted prices again. I can guarantee that when my contract expires. Xfinity will never have me as a customer again."
"Sherif of Davie, FL",6/7/2014,,"I opened an internet service with comcast about 20 days ago, and since day one there is a problem with the service, my account address, and finally with the bill. I contacted them through online chat and phone calls about 12 times, with nothing solved, and every time I beg them for a supervisor to call me, with no reply at all. I want to file a complaint now against them and claim for this very bad service and lost time."
"Julie of Loves Park, IL",6/9/2014,,"I have been a Comcast customer for 5 yrs and fortunately have not had any issues recently. It appears that Comcast has outsourced most of its customer service. My internet connection was dropping intermittently for the last 5 days and I called to get some help. My call first went to Mexico and the man there was unable to help me. He transferred me to Mike in the USA and he was able to get my service working again. About 1 hour later the problem started again. I once again called customer service this time ending up in the Philippines. That lady told me she would need to schedule an apt for a technician to come out between 12 and 2 pm. At 2 pm I had not heard from anyone so I called back. This time my call was sent to Columbia. That man told me that the appt. was between 12 and 5pm. Once again I waited and 5pm came and went with no technician at my home and no phone call from Comcast. I called back customer service once again and this time spoke with someone in Panama who told me that my appt. had been cancelled! I asked to speak with a supervisor and was finally transferred to a man in Schaumburg, IL who told me that there was never any appt. scheduled for me and that the information I was given was ""fraudulent"". Needless to say I'm furious. Comcast makes millions off its customers and should be ashamed of itself for trying to cut cost and send customer service overseas. If I had another option for internet service I would change companies, but I don't have any other options where I'm located! Beware of terrible customer service and of bold face lies from this company!"
"Steve of Mcdonough, GA",6/9/2014,,I had upgraded to a faster internet service and within one day I noticed that I was not receiving the data speeds I had just purchased. Made a call to Comcast and they said it was probably my router or my cable modem. Well I went out and purchased a new cable modem and router and installed them with the help of the technical staff at Comcast via the 800 number. Next day - same issues. I was not receiving the data speeds that I was promised. What was happening is when I reached about 70% of the data speed the network would disconnect and reconnect within minutes. I call Comcast and they had to send a technician out in order to eliminate my home network (I work in the telecom sector and my network was working up to specifications). I did not want the technician to come out and did not need the technician as I had already troubleshoot my network. Comcast forced a technician visit to my home.When the technician arrived - he replicated and documented the data speed that I purchased was not being delivered and could not find fault with my home network. Yet two weeks later I now get the data speeds that were promised - go figure. So now I am being charged $39.95 for a truck roll that I did not want â€“ need or ask for. I attempted to dispute the charge and was kept on hold for over 20 minutes and had to talk with three different people after navigating through automated attendant. I was spoken down to and was told if I do not pay the charge my account would be suspended. This is what I get for being a customer for 14 years and upgrading my service for faster internet.
"Kushana of Baltimore, MD",6/10/2014,,"Comcast canâ€™t get people service right but they can send out bills that are inaccurate. I just opened this account this May 2, 2014 and I logged in online and my bill is over 382 dollars. I have over a month transcripts of complaints."
"David of Claremont, NH",6/11/2014,,"I have been with Comcast for many years. In 2012, I moved into a new home and subscribed to Comcast double-play. I was paying 138.00 per month for HD service a 2nd box and DVR. In October 2013 when my 12-month introductory period was up, my bill went up to 157.50. In March of 2014, the bill rose to 167.96. I called and asked them why and they told me it was a rate increase. I asked them if there was any way to lower my bill and they offered me a home phone line for an additional 10 a month which will also give me HBO and Cinemax. Well, I don't want a home phone line. I have wireless phone service on 4 lines that I'm paying 200 per month for so a home phone is a useless luxury. In May of 2014, my Comcast bill rose to 175.35 per month. I called and asked why and I was told that my promotion was over and I was being billed for services individually. My Internet service was billed at 53.95 and the rest was for cable.But Wait, my promotion was over 6 months ago so that pig didn't fly. I asked again if there was anything they could do to lower the bill. They again offered me a home phone for an additional 10 per month and access to HBO and Cinemax. Again I told them that I didn't want a home phone. I told them that I was going to drop my cable service and the rep said that I was well within my rights to do so if I wanted.A few days later, I had DirecTV installed and I drove over to the Comcast office and returned my equipment only to be informed that my Internet Service was now going to cost me 69.00 per month plus tax because I didn't have phone service. However, if I wanted to purchase Xfinity triple play with blast Internet, I could get reinstated for 175.00 per month with access to HBO and Cinemax and Blast Internet and a home phone. Well, I'm glad I didn't do it because I DON'T WANT OR NEED A HOME PHONE which I've told them on numerous occasions and now I find out that if you have Blast Internet, they open up the WiFi router that you are paying them $8.00 per month to lease so that anyone driving by your house that has a Comcast account can log into the Internet. I just find this to be wrong.To make matters even worse, a couple of days after I canceled my service, I got a call from Comcast customer retention offering me (again) home phone service and Xfinity blast internet with HBO and Cinemax for 175.00 per month. If there was another option for Internet service in my area, I would take it but I live in a very rural area and I'm too far for the Telco Central office to get DSL."
"Jessica of Chico, CA",6/12/2014,,"To be honest, I am frustrated at the lack of customer service and what seems to be poor communication within the Comcast Company. From March 1st until the end of May, I did not receive Comcast Internet service because of ongoing and unresolved issues. During this time, I still paid anywhere from $48-$79 per month. The Internet was shutting off multiple times a day, leaving a small window of an hour or so to use it. We would attempt to reset the modem, check for loose cables, stop and restart everything, but most times this did not work. When that was the case, I had to call the Comcast office and have them restart our modem from their end. I did this anywhere from 2-7 times a week for three months.Since March 1st, I have called numerous times! I have called to have a technician come out and check the internet connection at least four times, I have called to have assistance restarting our modem 30+ times, I have gone in to exchange our modem twice, and I have even called to attempt to resolve our billing 6+ times. It took THREE MONTHS and EIGHT DAYS, for the Internet issues to even begin being resolved! I feel that I have been paying a company to lie to me in order to placate my anger while they do nothing to resolve the issues. Here is a short summary of my life with Comcast in the last three months:Â· Went to the Comcast office to try two new modems. Problem unresolved and monthly bill is raised.I have noticed my service bill has gone up since April 1st. I do not understand nor do I want to pay since I have not received any services promised for March, April or May. When I call, I am told a supervisor is not in, they are on a trip, and they are too busy to answer my call. I called the billing department around May 28th and was promised that a supervisor would be calling me back no later than June 4th to resolve the issue. This never happened. I called back in an attempt to have the conversation I was promised and was told that my credits are on hold and a supervisor is not in at the moment to discuss it further. Many times I have been told that I will get a credit on my account but this is never given. It wasn't until I spoke with someone from the Loyalties department that I was finally helped with my billing. This was, however, after I threatened to cancel my service due to the employee demeaning and accusing me! I am unimpressed."
"Gwendolyn of Colorado Springs, CO",6/12/2014,,"On May 21st, 2014, I called Xfinity (Comcast) to downgrade my services. Today I looked online at my bill and was still being charged the same amount for the services I no longer have. I have asked to speak to a supervisor at 1:15 pm on 6/12/2014."
"Craig  of Minnetonka, MN",6/13/2014,,"When I attempt to reply to an email the text block fills with hundreds of garbage characters. They cannot be erased. When I hit the reply icon on their toolbar the entire toolbar becomes inoperable and nothing is sent. Their Customer Service does not comprehend the problem. They read through a script that has nothing to do with the issue. They will not let me talk to a supervisor, nor a resident U.S. citizen, nor an email expert. My email has been inoperable for a month. No one there listens or cares or does anything about the problem."
"mike of Saint Paul, MN",6/13/2014,,"This is the third time in a month that I've had a negative experience with Comcast. The first time was when I was moving, had an issue, called them twice, sat on hold, got hung up on, and then the same thing happened again the following week. I am now unable to access my email even though I never changed my password and they told me a technician would call me from 5-9 last night, never called, and I have no email."
"tenin of Loganville , GA",6/13/2014,,"They are the worst company on earth. Bad customer service, lousy technicians... etc. The worst thing about them is the billing, they always mess with one's billing. Your bill is guaranteed to be at least $20.00 higher than the quoted price when you get your bill. They always have hidden fees. Comcast s..ks."
"William of Mount Joy, PA",6/13/2014,,"The caller's name and phone number used to display on my TVs up until a month or so ago. Then it completely stopped without warning. Also, the phone line drops out or has a lot of static fairly often. The WiFi router shows as weak reception within my own home and drops often. Certainly not the quality of service I would expect for the price I am paying."
"Paul of Elk Grove, CA",6/13/2014,,"My girlfriend and I switched from an old Comcast box to the new X1 DVR box. It's been one problem after another. I watch NHL playoffs, so the first thing I tried to do was search for games and record them. I used the search function and found that Xfinity had the NHL playoffs listed as a ""TV series"" and had grouped every playoff game into ""episodes"". But not every playoff game showed up under the list of ""episodes"". So if I wanted to record some games, I had to flip through the guide hour by hour, channel by channel, day by day. When trying to record from the listing on the guide, I was only allowed to extend the recording (I always extend recordings of games in case of overtime) by 5 minutes. This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of. It's a fact that 90% of the use of extending recording is for sports in case of overtime. Approximately 0% of the entire earth's population wants to extend their sports game by 5 minutes. Next, I tried to record game 7 of the NY Rangers and Pittsburgh Penguins. It appears as ""Stanley Cup Playoffs"" scheduled to air 4-6:30pm. After attempting to record the game, THE TITLE CHANGES to ""NHL Live"" and THE TIME SLOT CHANGES from 4-4:30pm! (And there is no NHL Live show scheduled in the guide). I extend the recording by 1 1/2 hrs and then the title CHANGES BACK to ""Stanley Cup Playoffs"", but the TIME SLOT stays the SAME!! So now, with 1 1/2 hrs extended time... The recording is now set for 4pm-6pm! Since the game is 3 hrs long, I missed the last hour of the game. THIS IS DIRECTLY DUE TO THE X1 XFINITY DVR SYSTEM.NOW.... I try to record Game 6 Chicago vs Minnesota listed for 6-8:30pm via the guide (this ""episode"" was not listed under ""Stanley Cup Playoffs""). I hit record, try to add 1 1/2 hrs to the end of the game (this is the most you can add to the end of an ""episode"" ONLY IF YOU RECORD USING THE SEARCH FUNCTION), but the TITLE CHANGES to ""Shark Tank"" and DOES NOT add 1 1/2 hrs to the end of the game (end of recording remains 8:30pm). Once it hits 8:30pm, the recording stops. So I MANUALLY hit the record button in order to record the remainder of the game. The DVR DOES NOT let me record. I hit the button numerous times with no results. I tried going through the ""INFO"" screen to record and it finally DOES record, but by this time the GAME is on, but the guide says some other show is on and won't let me extend the recording.First, I called the standard customer service number and explained the problems I'd been having. The first guy I reached was VERY quiet and didn't say much of anything. A couple times I thought I lost connection. My hunch was that he was new. It's important to note that during this call, I was watching my favorite team play an NHL playoff game. It's also important to note that at this point, I had ALREADY missed SEVERAL games and ends of games due to Xfinity's poor DVR performance. So after another stretch of dead silence, all of a sudden my TV screen goes black in the middle of the game! I asked him if that was him doing something to the DVR and he said yes. That he had sent a ""signal"" to the box without saying a word to me about what he was going to do... Without asking if this was a good time... Without saying hardly anything at all! I just hung up the phone. Strange thing happened after that ""signal"" was sent... The screensaver now pops up randomly while watching live TV, while watching playbacks of recordings, while watching On Demand movies. So the ""customer service"" rep interrupted my hockey game to add another problem to my DVR box!I decided to call a second time to explain the problems I've been having with the X1 system, including explaining what had happened the last time I called. THIS representative proceeded to tell me how to turn the screensaver function off. As if that was the solution to THEIR problem. It was at this point that I realized that I was getting absolutely NOWHERE with calling ""customer service"". I decided to take more active measures in my quest for customer satisfaction. So I started sending e-mails. First to NBCSN to explain that hockey games are 3 hours long. You would think that since they're a sports network that they WOULD KNOW HOW LONG NHL HOCKEY GAMES LAST. NOT 2 1/2 hours. Not 2 hours. 3 hours!!Second, I began writing emails to Comcast (Xfinity...whatever it's called) to explain that the way the X1 DVR box performs seems thrown together and untested. The IDEA behind the format is a good one, but there are WAY too many ""bugs"" in this system to have released this garbage to the public. I sent an e-mail to Tom **. The reply I got was from someone named ""Risa"" in which she apologized for my difficulties and expressed a desire to help me resolve my concerns. I replied with my account number so that they could more fully research my issues.The second email I got was from someone named ""Lovasie"" in which she apologized for my difficulties and expressed a desire to help me resolve my concerns. I got a 3rd email from someone named ""LaQuinta"" in which she apologized for my difficulties and expressed a desire to help me resolve my concerns. I got a 4th email from someone named ""Betsy"" in which she apologized for my difficulties and expressed a desire to help me resolve my concerns. Just when I was about to lose my mind... I get a phone call from Stephen ** who arranged to have a tech come out to my house to assess the functionality of my X1 DVR box. He said someone would be out to see me on 6/11/14 in the ""early afternoon"".No one called. No one showed up. I hate Comcast. I despise Xfinity. The only thing worse than their cable is their customer service. I think I may just stop paying my bill and use the X1 box for target practice."
"Carrie of Milton, DE",6/14/2014,,"Earlier this year we upgraded our internet service. We have been plagued with lag spikes ever since. We game, stream, and download virtual products regular. We have a top of the line router. Prior to upgrading our connection, we began to experience daily disconnections during peak hours. Comcast suggested upgrading when we complained, so we did.I can't tell you what's worse - good speeds with daily outages or fluctuating speeds and weekly outages. There have been days when our speeds are 15kb/s. If I could change to another broadband ISP, I'd have no hesitation. I'd even pay more if meant leaving Comcast in the dust. My European friends laugh at my expensively slow internet..."
"Mary H. of Fort Myers, FL",6/14/2014,,"We ordered Xfinity through Comcast back in October 2013 and since then our service has been horrible!! Every five to ten minutes the sound skips and you end up missing some of the most important words in the movie or show. I had someone sent out to check out why and the guy said our equipment was not strong enough to handle our package but that also it was a problem with the equipment outside. It apparently was old and needed replacement. So they said they would send someone out.As far as I knew no one came out, I never saw a truck, no one knocked on my door or called me. When I finally had enough I called and they very nastily told me they don't do that because they don't have to. I felt I deserved a refund for all the cable tv I missed and they refused. So I called their corporate offices and they treated me just as bad if not worse. I was told I did not call Comcast enough so therefore, I did not deserve it. My Bill was different every month and was given some crazy excuse about taxes and extra charges but would not explain what they meant.No one there has a clue what the right hand and the left hand are doing!! Now I'm stuck in an apartment complex that won't allow anyone to have anything other than Comcast which if I didn't know better I'm say my apartment complex ""The village at whiskey creek"" in Fort Myers, Florida 33907 is getting kickbacks for only allowing Comcast. I am now stuck with 4 and a 1/2 months on my lease and can not have anything other than antenna TV. Do we live in the United States of America or some communist Country? Can anyone tell me if this is illegal??"
"Tom of Portland, OR",6/14/2014,,"Today, 6/14/2014, I've only been on Comcast.net. I clicked on one of their little ""news videos"". It wouldn't run it, saying my Flash (Adobe) needed updating. Not true. I updated it yesterday, and I do have the latest version. Just on a hunch, I ran Malwarebytes. Yep, there was a ""potential threat"". I tried it again. Malware threat was back. It's not a virus, but what is Comcast putting on my computer that Malwarebytes labels it as a potential threat? DoNotTrackMe (blocks tracking cookies) daily blocks several Comcast tracking cookies (I suggest you dnld the free DNTM).A few yrs ago, I discovered Comcast was charging me for 2 modems. Customer Service offered me $7 back. ""Wait a minute, how many months have I been charged for two modems?"" ""I don't know, I can only refund 1 month."" The Philippines offered $14, claiming they don't have access to more than 2 months data. A girl in the Midwest only offered $14, blaming me for not telling them earlier. This runaround went on for months. I got a run around from the mgr in Beaverton, OR (Portland suburb). I was fed up. I told her if she didn't tell me exactly the number of months I was overcharged, I was going to drag her into small claims court, and she could spend her day telling the judge why she and her company were cheating their customers.She looked it up, and reluctantly authorized a refund of over $200 of this overcharge at $7/mo. I tried to buy my modem. Just one more total lying runaround. Now the charge is $8/mo rental ($96/yr, look at your bill). To buy one costs about $175. Try getting them to activate one you buy. There are zillions of horror stories on the internet about this subject (just Google it). The exact same modem is available on the open market, but they make up excuses not to activate it. I read a few reviews where a clever customer was able to fool them into activating a purchased one, but the hassle, and most likely inability to pull it off just doesn't seem worth it to me. It's outrageous. Comcast, in national surveys (such as Forbes) consistently ranks in the bottom 10 for customer service. They lamely respond they're trying to improve. Yeah, I really believe them."
"Alicia of Memphis, TN",6/14/2014,,"My husband (Andre **) is the account holder. He has tried for over 2 months to have an additional X1 Platform box added for our den. A technician was requested/scheduled to come out on 4 separate occasions. They NEVER showed and the account was credited 20 dollars each time BUT we never got what we wanted which was an additional box! So, just this week, we thought to give it another try. On Wednesday it was suggested to my husband by a customer service rep to visit a Comcast store/site and pick up the X1 Platform box himself. He had to visit 2 sites and was given the WRONG box which was antiquated/discontinued (discovered after he installed it). After he connected the box, our cable/internet service to the rest of the house went out. We have been without cable/internet for 3 DAYS! He has been on the phone with customer service reps and supervisors who do nothing more than place the blame on one another, make empty promises, give more measly 20 dollar credits, and flat out LIE! It will be another 2 days (Sunday - Father's Day) before another technician will pull a No Call No Show! WORST PROVIDER EVER!"
"Ray of Nashville, TN",6/15/2014,,"X1 box locks up, no response to remote control, internet gateway restarts intermittently. TV picture pixelated so badly it can't be watched. Comcast's fix is ""reboot"" that fixes nothing."
"beverly of Thorndale, PA",6/16/2014,,"I had called a year ago or more asking about this charge and they told me it was for something else, not my internet modem/router, so I let it go. I went to the Comcast Office and they confirmed that it was not their modem which they could tell by the serial number showing in the system and have been billing me for 4 years. They entered a refund ticket for $376 of which the main office only credited back $24. This is a legal issue, it is fraud to bill someone monthly fees on something that is clearly showing in their records a serial number that isn't theirs. I need legal advice as soon as possible and will be going to BBB."
"Garth of Bellingham, WA",6/16/2014,,"Had Comcast for years and the same thing... the bill will go up $10... few months later $20. We moved to Bellingham, Wa two years ago and set up Comcast for our internet. We set up an account and it was to be $36 a month for two years. That lasted 6 months then it went up. just found out they were charging me double what they should have been $75 a month and billing me for a cable modem that I own. I wish there was another option. It's Comcast or nothing!"
"benny of Madison Heights, VA",6/16/2014,,"I got a promotion in the mail to move to Comcast and bundle. On June 6, 2014 Comcast came to provide service. They worked on it for two days. No service yet but we received the bill. Called to correct the problem and charges. They are saying call back."
"Larry of Jackson, MS",6/16/2014,,"I am EXTREMELY angry with comcast. Re: customer service with my issue of constantly losing my internet connection. After spending over an hour texting with a rep. (because you can't get someone on the phone), my problem was not resolved and I was given a Quick Resolution Ticket # and did not get a response until 72 hours later. Then, this rep. sounded as though she was having her lunch and was smacking in my ear. This one reiterated by problem, told me what the causes could be and suggested that I make an appointment for a technician. I THOUGHT THIS CALL WAS TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT FOR A TECHNICIAN TO COME OUT!!! I continue to experience losing connection and will probably just look into another internet provider. I cannot believe the horrible customer relations when they charge such outrageous prices for this substandard service!"
"jo of Tucker, GA",6/16/2014,,"I have been a customer for MANY yrs...Hopefully I am not the only US citizen or wherever that is 'almost' computer illiterate. I'm learning! That being said... I CAN READ AND WRITE and I am actually intelligent enough to know that the 'Visa $50 Gift Card' that I was 'promised' ... is offered on a sheet of Xfinity letterhead! However... when I called Comcast/Xfinity customer service(s), I was told that ""No.. we don't have ANYTHING to do with the processing of Gift Cards"", and I was immediately transferred not once or twice but 3 times only to of been given the contact number for the 'gift card ctr'??? When I ordered this BUNDLE 'deal', I DID NOT place my order with a 'gift card ctr'... I placed my order with Comcast/Xfinity!!! And I was told by Comcast/Xfinity that THEY would send my 'gift card'... (did I forget to mention I can hear very well) anyways... I have fulfilled my part of the agreement so WTF... If I don't pay my bill, they WILL turn off my service... so I personally believe that it is only fair that I send them a copy 'not the original' of their letterhead offering a $50 Visa gift card with the logo 'Xfinity' displayed on the 'dummy card' attached to their letterhead and maybe THEY can get this 'gift card ctr' to reimburse THEM for the $50 that I'm deducting from my payment! I mean surely THEY wouldn't reject their OWN gift card??? And should this card appear one day...when I'm long gone... I ask that they forward it to my daughter who ALSO is awaiting a $50 Xfinity Visa gift card... No matter what they say, ""Mom does NOT always know best""... I referred my daughter to Comcast/Xfinity! Sorry Kid!"
"c. of Salt Lake City, UT",6/17/2014,,"Comcast SERVICE is atrocious. They raise prices monthly. I have been a customer for 10 years and I have to wait 3 weeks for service? I broke my pelvis and asked Comcast to deliver an HD box and install it so I can watch TV downstairs since I can't walk upstairs. I am flat on my back. Multiple calls got me nowhere. They cannot come until 3 weeks. What is wrong with them? They suck all this money off their customers and when I ask for 1 service, which I have to pay for they give me an appointment 3 weeks later. All begging and asking resulted in nothing.Their internet services is flawed. They charge for tiny boxes I received 10 years ago monthly 9.95. So I like to get tv downstairs because I am in a wheelchair and can't go upstairs and voila I have to wait 3 weeks. THIS IS UNHEARD OF. They are monopolizing the market and therefore don't care for real customer service. It's totally not fair. They moved it to the 28th of June, 11 days from now. Why can't they offer a simple service to a customer who really is just laying there and unable to go to a store and get the box?"
"Joie of Visalia, CA",6/17/2014,,"I signed up for triple play service, was quoted $109.99 for service and CS would call me back in 24 hrs to set up time to install. 3 calls and 4 days later, was scheduled for set up. When tech arrive he only had information that I was to get double play and had to call in for information. Because the work order was not set up properly, they had to disconnect my phone, give me a new number for 5 days to get the phone transferred. Tech was at my house for 3 hours trying to get issues resolved and just left after it was time for him to go home. I kept getting calls from the company trying to resolve the phone order and found out that they again had me set on another payment of over $188 a month. I talked to the CS and wasted another hour on the phone. Then I got another email stating my payments would be $188, and called back to see what was going on. They went in and checked my account and said on their side they had the correct amount and would notify whoever to straighten it out. Meantime we had television that was spotty and remote, would not change channels properly. I had to elderly aunts that were having a hard time and decided to call in to see what could be done about it. When I talked to CS, they stated that we had the $144 a month program! Now I have had so many people telling me different amounts and still the service was not working correct, so told them that I was going to call them back later cause I was going to cancel their service because of the mess. I told the CS not to cancel until I called back. They terminated the service the next day!!!!!!!! I hate this company. I have a feeling they are going to bill me incorrectly as well."
"Ashley of St. Paul , MN",6/17/2014,,"YOU HAVE THE WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE! We have a down line in our backyard and we have been trying for 2 months to try to get someone to come out to our house and get someone to take care of it. We can't let our dogs or my 2 year old daughter play in the yard because of this wire! We can't even cut our grass. This is the worse customer service that I have ever seen. We call your customer service number every other day. Do you guys even keep records of that? No, we don't have an account with you guys and that seems to be the problem! We are renting this house from the previous owner who did have an account with Comcast. We were told that if we agree to get an account with you guys, Comcast can guarantee that someone will come over and take care of it. Seriously? Why would I want to have an account with you guys? This would make my third bad experience with Comcast. Why would I want to continue that? IT'S COMPLETE BULL! We have been promised countless times that someone will come take care of it and no one has ever shown up or called to schedule an appointment time. We have come to the point to where we are going to talk to our Attorney General. Seriously.. Why does it have to come to that? I have never experienced such poor customer service in my entire life! We were told that there is nothing running through that line, then we we're told that there is. Does anyone communicate at Comcast? The wire says High Voltage so we are not going to risk touching the line. What do I have to do to get someone's attention at Comcast? I will never have service with you guys (I have in the past) and I will NEVER recommend Comcast to anyone I know! I have friends and family canceling their service with you guys just because of this incident because they do not want to experience customer service like this. If something were to happen, they needed to get a hold of someone in Customer service. I am so disappointed!"
"don of Portland, OR",6/18/2014,,"I was a customer for over 25 years and decided to try it again. Nothing has changed, driver was here at about 1 pm (appointment was set for 12 to 2). He showed up at 1:00 stood by his truck for about 10 minutes and then left. I called Comcast and the driver said he came to my door and knocked, which is a flat out lie because I was working in the front yard. I have 2 dogs in the house that if you even walk up my sidewalk the dogs bark like crazy, ALWAYS. I tried to speak to someone in management, the person on the phone was not going to let that happen. This is worse than when I dropped them a year ago."
"Yolanda of Detroit, MI",6/18/2014,,"On 6/8/14, the service for Comcast at my former address was disconnected at my request. Comcast proceeded to charge me for service not used on 6/21/14. On 6/13/14, I had requested to transfer service to my current address. On 6/16/14, I contacted customer service via chat about a charge. I've seen $189 charge on my account. The customer rep informed me that a converter box was still missing. I contacted my brother at the Inkster address, and told my brother what the rep stated. He stated that Comcast came to the house and collected all the converter boxes and other equipment. Today, I called Comcast to once again request service for my new address, and that my brother stated the equipment was picked up. The representative informed me that the equipment was picked up and the charge was due to an outstanding bill. For about 45 minutes, I was placed on hold repeatedly. At first, the representative informed me that there was a misplaced payment on my account, that someone with a different account had their payment placed on my account. Then, I asked for the EXACT date for the charge, the representative stated it was from 5/4-6/4/14. My brother had paid for the amount of $178 on 6/9/14 via credit card. I want Comcast to stop double-billing me for an amount that was billed AFTER I had the service disconnected."
"LESLIE of Marietta, GA",6/19/2014,,"Had my internet service mysteriously stop working a week ago while listening to Pandora. Think Comcast gives two craps about correcting problem as promised to a customer of many years- think again! I knew something was up many months ago when my internet kept going out & losing its IP address or default gateway constantly plus having modems replaced twice in barely a year. And I was always told it was ""interference in my own home"" & not any fault of theirs. Oh & also recently supposedly some interference in MY house was creating interference with ""other neighbors' service"" that required them to come in my house- but at last minute they decided wasn't necessary without further comment- maybe cause I made it clear I didn't wish to upgrade like they wanted. It's all in the news now and all part of a game of greed on their part to use your home internet signals that YOU pay dearly for monthly to fuel their big project of ""providing alleged secure wifi hotspots"" that have been shown by experts to not be totally secure & unhackable. Glad I moved on to use another carrier & not wait for it to hit the fan & have my computer hacked. Comcast got too high & mighty for their pants & it will come back to bite them in the end & I will be laughing (with working service & much better customer service) when karma comes around!"
"Richard of Northampton, MA",6/20/2014,,"As has happened with others, I received a letter urging me to upgrade my modem. The letter stated, in the fourth paragraph: ""To protect our environment, please properly recycle your older modem... Please note that there is no unreturned equipment fee for your older modem."" Then, on my latest bill, I received a monthly charge for this modem. When I called, I was essentially told ""Too bad, you have to return it or face monthly charges."""
"William of Missouri City, TX",6/20/2014,,"First off we've used Comcast for many many years at my folks house. Well, I recently leased a house for my fiance and 4 yr old and decided I wanted to stick with Comcast and would be signing up as a NEW customer. Sounds great and easy right? Wrong! I applied for my service June 13th 2014, received a installation date of June 20th between 10-12. Everything is OK. 2 days before my install date I received a letter saying I was denied service! (OK, I can lease a house for $1200/month but not your service? Really), the next day I receive my confirmation email that the install is for the specified date. WTF? I have my fiance call and see what going on. They tell her my service was installed 2 days ago! (You would think I know if Have cable or not since we waited a week right?). We tell them no we haven't, our date is tomorrow (the 20th). They say since their records show it was installed 2 days ago that we have to set it up again.. for the 30th! So, you first say I'm denied, then send a confirmation email, then say it was installed 2 days prior, and then want me to wait another 10 DAYS?!? We tell them that is unacceptable and unsatisfactory and want our original date. They put a ""manager"" on the phone and they say there's no way that can happen. At that point the conversation is over! My brother worked for Comcast for over 8 years! Many many MANY nights he didn't get home till after 10pm because mess ups like this and having to maintain customer satisfaction! Now you say it can't happen?? Comcast is a bunch of morons! We called DirecTV, explained the situation and guess what, less than 18 hours later they came and hooked us up! Guess who just gained a customer? Not Comcast! Comcast charges you for everything, even dropping packages you don't want anymore, and then their packages are stupid how they categorize them.. pay for a whole package for ONE channel you want! Dumb! It's no wonder my brother quit after 8 years! If I had to work and deal with these morons that long I'd quit also!"
"Karla of Noblesville, IN",6/21/2014,,"I have been a loyal Comcast customer for almost ten years. That is why, in December of 2013 when a Comcast door to door salesman came to my home to sell me the Xfinity home services, I was trusting and listened to what he had to say. During our conversation I informed him that there was a chance that my husband's job would be transferring us back to Illinois in the near future. I specifically asked the salesman if I was transferred to an area that was not serviced by Comcast... would I still have to be held to my contract and pay a penalty. The salesman adamantly assured me that the contract would be null and void if we were to move to an area that was not serviced by Comcast. He even acted as if that would be crazy for Comcast to charge someone for services they were not able to provide. Fast forward to today... I called Comcast to transfer our services because we were in fact transferred to Illinois. I was transferred several times because the service rep could not figure out how to close and open a service in two different states. Then, I received the shocking news that the town we are moving to was not serviced by Comcast and that Comcast would be holding me to a 1000.00 early termination fee. Over the next several hours I was bounced from person to person, from department to department. All gave me the same news. I was going to be charged 1000.00 for moving to an area that Comcast does not service even if the salesman used a lie to get my business. I asked several people for his name and number or what local office he came from. NO service agent could find this information. They did not have my signed contract either. They gave me different towns that the offices may be in. Tomorrow I will set out to hunt for the name of this salesman to have him verify he told me the wrong information. I am fighting for this because of the principle. I trusted a salesman from a company I have been loyal to for almost ten years. Now Comcast has turned on me despite the fact that I have never missed a payment and have been a loyal customer. I take responsibility for not looking into the details further... however I think Comcast should take responsibility for holding customers financially hostage."
"Michael of Crystal Lake, IL",6/22/2014,,"We dropped Comcast Cable about 20 years ago because they kept increasing their fees by 8-10% year, citing programming costs. They wouldn't be more specific, only offering us reduced services to meet our budget. About 1-1/2 years ago, one of their sales approached us regarding cable, internet, and phone services bundling. We told him of our past experiences with Comcast. He assured us that they were a ""new"" company, focused on customer ""satisfaction."" Really? We advised him that we were retired and on fixed incomes and really couldn't afford anything that would increase our monthly costs by more than a few dollars. For 2 hours he swore to us that the MOST the cost ""ever"" went up was $20 and ""if it did,"" it would likely be around $10 a month. We told him that this would not work, and again and again he assured us that this scenario was ""unlikely."" I wish I had recorded the conversation. The bottom line was that the service agreement ""that we never saw"" specifically states that after 12 months, the cost would go up $20 per month and even more after 24 months. After a few months of seeing increased costs, I began calling the service centers. I went round and round with one group after another only to reaffirm our suspicions -- lied to again. The salesman that sold us the package would not return my calls. DO NOT TRUST this company. They will tell you anything to get your business. Needless to say, I'm counting the days until I'm done with them for good."
"myeuropeantouch of Jacksonville, FL",6/23/2014,,"Made four appointments with them, which were not kept, nor received courtesy call that they will not show. They promise $20.00 for a no show or late show, which btw you will not get! Reason I know the appointments were made by me, because I called over and over again and Customer Service told me on 06-17-14 the Tech noted on his work orders that he called and no one answered, that's why he didn't come. I was home all day for the two appointments and home all day the second day for 2 appoint.Btw, cancelled two Doc's Appointment I had to accommodate Comcast and they were a no show 4 times. I was given an escalation number which apparently means nothing - 4 appoint in 2 days were not kept. I was lied to again for that day. They scrubbed their records, so nothing would show for the appoint I made. I then proceeded to call again, was on the phone, which the automated service told me ""Oh, looks like a Tech has recently visited you, is your service working""... proof that I did schedule, proof that there is a record, and proof that records are falsified, as NO TECH was ever here. After that I was on the phone again with numerous people until 5:30 PM with no success to troubleshoot on my own via phone. Mind you I am disabled, 67 years old, foot in a cast, and my back injured. Was asked to crawl amongst the cable behind my desk, unplug things - do this, do that and all had been troubleshot before already with numerous other folks and it did not work. Was then transferred to a number which played elevator music forever, at which at some point by 8:30PM I just hung up. I filed a complaint with the BBB and the FCC.On 06-19-14 when I called Billing to make sure I get my credits, I was told that they/she didn't show any missed appointments. None have ever been scheduled all week with the exception of Friday 06-20 between 1-3 PM. As stated before, records are falsified and scrubbed. Received ph call from CEO for escalation. I have made it a point to read your Code of Conduct online, not one of their employees in Customer Service care about them, everywhere. Comcast employees have the worst reputations online and by word of mouth in customer service.Never in my life - I am 67 years young, disabled, has a company frustrated me out of my mind and brought me to tears because I have been told in so many words, or it was insinuated, or implied that I am a liar in regards to all the appointments I made and my computer is working, when my internet was still not working - no connection. A disgrace, really... Well, the records are scrubbed clean on Comcast's Computers of all these incidents. I was told it shows nothing at what really took place in 2.5 days. What a shame that employees at Comcast use this method to safe their behinds! That they did a terrible job in serving one of its customers. Seems they have so many customers, they really do not need me. I refuse to ever be subjected to this kind of behavior or treatment by persons I pay every month, on time, way in advance before due date, and opted for the service charge every month to have a tech come inside to check for problems with my service. SHAME ON YOU."
"Norma of Alsip, IL",6/23/2014,,"(PLEASE KEEP THIS GOING.) I'm actually going through an issue with Comcast myself!!! They offered us a great package, according to them around $67.99 a month after taxes, & 3 free months of premium channels. My first bill was $300 & something dollars, my next two were around $175.00. When we called, we got transferred and disconnected on several occasions. When we finally got through, we decided to cancel service since we weren't getting answers. The customer solutions representative then told us we were under a signed contract and couldn't cancel without an early termination fee. We told her we wanted a copy of it because we didn't sign anything. She proceeded to say, ""It was a verbal contract over the phone,"" and her supervisor would have to listen to the conversation and get back to us! Not to mention we have to take their word for it!Almost 4 months later, no one has bothered to get back to us and when we call we get transferred, then disconnected!!! We finally gave in and paid the early termination fee because Comcast decided to disconnect our internet service (which we've been paying every month!!!). I hope everyone shares this post. I would really love my money back (all of it). I've emailed the media. I hope I can get somewhere!!!"
"DonLeroy of Philadelphia, PA",6/23/2014,,"I recently moved across town and used Comcast Movers Edge to transfer my service to the new address. An installation appointment was scheduled & the technician showed up as promised. That was 20 days ago. Today, I turned on the TV and instead of expected programming, I received an error code. Called Comcast, who eventually restored the picture by resetting the cable box. I was then informed that I owed more than $400.00 dollars (despite being enrolled in auto-pay) and that I should log on to my account to pay the bill. After logging on, I discovered not only that the account showed my old address but that my email accounts hadn't been transferred over to the new address either! After being passed around to three different people, I was informed that they couldn't verify my identity over the phone and would have to go to a Customer Service Center in person to straighten it out. They screwed up the account, and now I have to waste my time to straighten it out?!? The numerous ads for Movers' Edge are tantamount to false and deceptive advertising, IMHO. Their idea of ""transferring"" service apparently doesn't include billing functions, which is nothing less than idiocy! If I'm only ""transferring"" existing service, why are they (Comcast) acting as if I initiated NEW service?"
"Nancy of Indianapolis, IN",6/24/2014,,"Comcast is a monopoly! I have no choice in cable TV and I need a choice in cable TV, because I have spent almost two weeks and numerous hours trying to undo what Comcast did to my 88 year old mother-in-law!!!It looks like she was taken advantage of during a recent visit by Comcast to her house. She has a caregiver who called after a storm because the cable wasn't working. The caregiver scheduled an appointment and the technician told her she needed a new box. He went on to explain that ALL boxes would have to be switched out anyway because of a ""new system"", but they would have to schedule another appointment. At that first appointment the tech. broke a $650.00 glass sculpture and said Comcast would contact them to figure out what to do - it has not yet happened.The second tech came out to replace the box and left. The next thing they knew, after hours of no incoming phone calls, was that the ATT phone number she has had for over 60 years had been ""stolen"" by Comcast and she was given a new number without any explanation or permission!! I have been traveling so trying to stay on top of this has been difficult. While I was gone I was informed by the caregiver that her internet had also disappeared.When I heard about this the night after her number had disappeared, I spent hours on the phone trying to get her number back, which is connected to her doctors and home security. I found an email address of someone at Comcast, so I wrote to him and continued to resend it until I heard from someone. After a few days I heard from Michael **, from Comcasts Exe. offices in Michigan (** his direct line). Basically, all that Mr. ** did was to call me everyday until the problem was resolved, which is an added issue they (Comcast) couldn't do anything to undo what they did, because ATT owned the number. But, then why could they mess with it in the first place??? After finally getting Att out to the house two different times- one for phone and one for internet - my mother-in-law has her number back.I had to ask Mr. ** for compensation for Att's $99.00 repair charge and begrudgingly, again after I insisted, he agreed to give her a 20% discount for 6 months. All was never offered - I had to ask!!!! When all lines were back to normal, Mr. ** asked me if he could do anything else. I replied by requesting an answer to a question; How is it Comcast is not considered a monopoly. He got rather agitated and said he could not answer that question. When I pushed to be transferred to someone that could answer that question, he basically told me we were done.**"
"Chrystal of Sicklerville, NJ",6/24/2014,,"Ok. I contacted Comcast back in February 2014 of this year about why my bill went up. They told me because the promotion had ended. I asked if there were any new promotions. They said yes, it was scheduled and my new equipment and package was still suppose to be the same price which was $159.99, per month. (Keep in mind it was suppose to be for 24 months) That was in effort starting March 2014 only. On my next 2 bills my monthly went up to $199.99 per month. I have spent almost a whole day in total trying to get answers from Comcast. I spoke to at least 4 people, nothing. I even went to the local office yesterday, in Pleasantville, NJ, and waited. The rep said she was waiting for a supervisor, she saw as well the promo when it ended. She came out about 10 minutes later and said the supervisor said to call the 1-800#. I said I did several times and nothing and no one can answer my questions. I have attached 3 monthly invoices."
"Rodd of Fredericksburg, VA",6/24/2014,,"Dropped calls, locked cable and extended outages. The Comcast repair is to power the cable box or modem off and send them a check! Cable box replaced 12 times over the last 3 years. Newest XFINITY box locks up every week. Service tech was a no show on Fatherâ€™s Day and had me waiting... Finally showed up Tuesday and said to power cycle to fix problem (third call on this box). Tech on phone asked ME to remove cable box, return to Comcast and get new box, connect it and they would initialize it to repair problem. I asked him how much they would pay me to do their job that I was paying for service? They said nothing!"
"Yvonne of Malvern, PA",6/24/2014,,"My problem with Comcast is every month, my bill is due on the 25th of the month. My cycle ends on the 5th of every month. There is a grace period of 7 days. Before my cycle ends, they generate a new bill before the grace period even ends. So when they sent me a new bill, they still carry the 2 months bill even though they are already paid. Not only are they are doing that, I am being charged a late fee of 9.95, so now I am paying 195.00 a month. I am told that they would drop the late fee but the next month, it's back again. And yet, they say they charge ahead of time."
"Richard of Glenview, IL",6/25/2014,,"I've had service with Comcast going back to September of 2013 and everything was working fine until late January of 2014. Started having problems with the video and audio constantly going out and they sent 6 different technicians to rectify the problem and failed. Every single one of them talked like rocket scientists saying everything's fine now you won't be having any problems and what do you know shortly after they leave I still have the same problem. On top of all that I was being charged for a modem that Comcast says it belongs to them when I never rented a modem from them because I have my own that I purchased from Bestbuy. In addition, to my service issues the wait time to talk to customer service has been an average of 20 min or longer. And when I go speak with someone it's someone that can't comprehend my needs because they're from a third world country with no concept of CUSTOMER SERVICE. I am fed up with paying my hard earned money for service that's worked less than 50% of the time. It took Comcast 5 months to realize they don't know how to resolve the issue so they said they would give me a refund. The supervisor that has been dealing with my issue said she would call me after she finds out my total refund amount and it has been over 3 weeks. I called customer service to find out the amount and it's not what the supervisor Trish had mentioned. I will never ever use COMCAST AGAIN."
"Kenneth of Petaluma, CA",6/26/2014,,"I have had Comcast Internet and phone service (VoIP) for 1 year and as soon as the year was up, they raised the monthly price by 40%. I phoned their toll free number and talked to 2 different representatives who would not budge on their new monthly price. I did tell them I would be switching to AT&T if I could not keep the current price and they still would not negotiate any price change. I then contacted AT&T and ordered their Uverse service at slightly less than I had been paying from Comcast, more than 40% less than the new price from Comcast. At no time did the Comcast representatives tell me I would be charged a $90 cancellation fee for canceling my 2 year contract early. This was told me when I took back the modem I was renting from Comcast after AT&T had installed my Uverse system. The employees in the Comcast store here in Petaluma, California, including the manager, told me I had signed a 2 year contract. I told him I had never signed any contract and if it was 2 years, how come the price went up after one year. I asked to see this alleged contract but he said he couldn't and it didn't matter because it was probably a verbal contract and he was going to charge me $90 for canceling the contract even though he could not show me the contract. At first he wouldn't even take back the modem, but did eventually and gave me a receipt for it after I insisted. A few days ago I received my closing bill and sure enough, there was the $90 charge. Americans should be made aware of this company and how they will say anything to squeeze more money from you with no legal standing. They are so big that they can ruin your credit if you don't pay. I understand that and probably will have to pay them because my credit rating is very important to me, but if there is any way to get the money back, I will try my best to do so. I might add that I am a 76 year old American senior citizen living on a fixed income and would have thought some consideration might have been made by this corporate bully. I have recently read they are the most hated corporation in America, I can understand why."
"Dan of Belcamp, MD",6/28/2014,,"I'm 63 years old and have never worked with a company worse than Comcast. Comcast insists on charging me a monthly modem rental fee on a non existing modem. They say I have two modems? Both are the same model with a serial number off by one letter?? The truth is, on May 26, 2013 I purchased a modem through Amazon for $66.91. My wife called in the information so Comcast could set the modem up. The number was read wrong and then immediately corrected (contained D not O). The service rep, instead of correcting the number added another modem with the corrected number. Every couple of months Comcast tries to charge me for a non existing modem. It usually takes several calls and a couple of hours of my time to get it corrected. Online it still shows two modems on my account. Comcast won't take it off. Under the fictitious modem data usage always says ""We're sorry. We can't load your usage meter right now."" GEE I WONDER WHY!"
"Amor of Jacksonville, FL",6/28/2014,,"This company has the worst customer service!!!! Unfortunately, the first young lady I spoke to did not provide me her name - before hanging up on me!!! I called in again and a representative by the name of Kandice ** told me that I could either take a call back or wait on the line for an hour to speak with a manager!!! What kind of company tells a customer they have to wait on the line for an hour to speak to a manager????? I waited for a total of 30 minutes before hanging up. I'm currently in the market for a new cable/internet/security provider!!"
"Bob of Mobile, AL",6/29/2014,,"6/21, internet stops working. Call Comcast service line. Talk with someone who apologizes for the inconvenience. Determines that the modem (supplied by Comcast) is not working. Says they can send someone on 6/24. I explain that I work on the Internet and that I cannot be out of touch for that long. Person apologizes again and says they will escalate the trouble ticket and I will hear from someone on 6/22 by noon. Noon on 6/22 comes and goes and I hear from no one. Call Comcast again. Supervisor apologizes again and says the the escalation was denied but that I will hear from someone at Comcast by 10 am on 6/23. 10 am on 6/23 comes and goes, and another call to Comcast and another supervisor apologizes for the inconvenience. This supervisor ""guarantees"" that someone from Comcast will call and that a service person will come to my house by the end of the day on 6/23, but just to make sure, I have an appointment for a service call between 3 and 5 pm on 6/24. You guess it - no call and no service on 6/23, but service tech does come to my house at 4 pm on 6/24 and ""fixes"" the Internet problem. By this time, I have spent more than 2 and a half hours on the telephone with Comcast. Fast forward a few days to 6/27, and internet is out again. Another call to Comcast, another apology for the inconvenience. Supervisor promises service by midday on 6/28, but, no surprise, no one shows. Another call to Comcast, another apology for the inconvenience and another promise that someone will call between 10 am and noon on 6/29 to arrange to fix the problem. No one calls or fixes anything and another call to Comcast and another apology for the inconvenience. This time, no promise of quick service (I think by now they figure I have caught on that they can make all the promises they want and I can't do anything if the promise is not kept; so why bother), but there will be a service person here between 8 and 10 am on 7/1. I'll believe it when I see it. It's pretty clear that there is a disconnect between the folks who take your call for service and the people who actually fix things and Comcast just as clearly doesn't seem concerned about that disconnect. Oh, and when I called and asked for a credit for the service that I'm paying for and not getting, then Comcast offered to sell me some additional services. Sounds like a good deal!"
"Meg of Moraga, CA",6/29/2014,,"I have noticed over the past few weeks that internet service fails EVERY evening now, starting at about 7 pm. I have to reboot the modem and just cross my fingers that I can get access again to continue watching TV and to complete work I took home from the office. It's the REGULARITY of the outage that frustrates me. I am going to look for any other internet service provider - if anyone launches a class-action lawsuit over the lack of service we have paid for, count me in. Unless, of course, the 1% has rigged the system and we 99%ers can no longer petition for relief via class action suits."
"John of Bellingham, WA",6/30/2014,,"Online Consumer Fraud. On 6/28/14, I went online to sign up for new service. I went through their entire process and was able to sign up for their Triple Play bundle offer of 2 years, locked in with several benefits offered such as $400.00 in VISA gift cards (right there on their website), a free second room tuner, an install date of July 6th and free installation with a one-time $25.00 second room fee. Great, I agree. I then received a confirmation email with that pricing structure. Then received a second email asking that I call customer service to finalize the process.This is where things went off the rails. At this point, it's been two days of phone calls and just over 5 hours of time. I was informed that the second room box would NOT be free and finally told it would be $9.95 per month. The Installation Date was now moved to July 21. At one point, I received another email confirming the 21st date, and that the installation fee would be $125.00. That had been corrected back to zero. And now, mysteriously, the gift card was only $200.00 despite the $400.00 amount CLEARLY stated on their own web page.Again, after two days and just over 5 hours, the only answer I was ever able to get was ""Sorry"" and that this was someone else's department. I have cancelled my entire order and will be filing charges with the Better Business Bureau and the Federal Communications Commission. If anyone knows of other venues, advice would be greatly appreciated. In short, Comcast seems to be committing consumer fraud, and they could care less."
"Jennifer of Milford, NH",6/30/2014,,"Billing issues, charges and fees imposed after being told there were none. Leaving messages that are not returned. I finally filed an online complaint with the State Utilities Commission, and my problem was resolved that day. If you have a legitimate complaint, I suggest this avenue. It worked for me."
"David of Albuquerque, NM",7/1/2014,,"It all started when we moved. A rep told us we would need to exchange our boxes for different ones in order for the cable to work right. My son drove down to the center to exchange the boxes and he was told we didn't have to. Oh, we did an install ourselves, and done it many a time before, so we found out one line didn't work, so here came the cable guy. Our fault; 'you don't pay' and vise versa. Well their fault, we didn't receive a bill for April, so I called the automated bill pay and fell out of my chair, $456.00! We have the $89.00 package, $119.00 with tax! Called and red hot, I got a representative and immediately started to almost scream at this guy. He introduced himself and I could barely understand him. I'm man, I thought no use! He said I would be angry too, I asked his name again and it was Burney. I asked him, ""Do you spell it with a 'ie' at the end or a 'ey'?"" He said, ""'Ey' why you ask? ""That was the name of my dad who had passed away."" Immediately we hit it off. Burney is a name not used much spelled that way. So I was charged for the cable guy, I was charged for the installation, I was charged for the equipment which I never received and misc items. This man pulled out all the stops.Got my bill down to $130.00 for April and got the May bill down to normal. Now this is the type of representative Comcast should model their people after. Come to find out he was from Spain, not overseas but right in sunny California! If you ever call Comcast again ask for Burney not Burnie, and Burney if you read this, David says hi!!!"
"C. U. of Santa Clara, CA",7/1/2014,,"Been a Comcast customer since 2004 (more than 10 years) and shocked at their treatment to a loyal customer. 4/23 - I saw a door tag saying Xfinity technician had been to our area and identified an issue either Ingress or Egress. I still have this tag. To avoid service I was supposed to call the Comcast office and schedule a time to repair the problem. I checked with my in-laws who were home and they said internet has been down since morning. I called immediately and was on the phone for more than 45 minutes. I asked the CS person if there will be a charge as I do not want to pay for this. I was told there will be no charge so I scheduled an appointment for next day.4/24 - I took off for half a day to be home but the technician did not show up. I called customer service and was told the technician was there and took care of the problem from outside and did not have to come inside my home. I checked my internet and it was still down. I told the rep this and she tried to get technical support. We tried pinging and connecting to the modem but there was no connectivity. I was asked to make another appointment for tech to come and check it. I complained that I took half a day off and it cost me half a day's pay as I had no vacation days to take for this. The rep came back saying I will get credit for internet for the month. I thought that is pretty fair and agreed to another appointment.4/26 Rep came home and started investigating outside first. He said there were cables outside which had signal leaks and he had to replace a few of them at the location where all the wires come in. He then also said my splitter was old and he replaced it. This was outside the house again. I had two modems which I own and he recommended I use the newer one which is Docsis 3. I said ok and he set it up and internet was back. After a few days, I received a bill with $50 for the tech visit and I called Comcast to dispute this. They said they will credit this and should show in next bill. I also asked for the internet credit which the CS said we cannot get. I told the CS I was told on the last call that there will be a credit but CS did not budge. I was furious to say the least. I said I want to cancel all my services if Comcast is not honoring their word. Didn't make a difference, CS did not even make an attempt to forward me to retention. Just took my request and asked what date I want to cancel the service. Wow! So much for being a customer for 10 years.My billing period was 11th to 10th of the month. Two weeks before May 11th I requested cancellation of my service with Comcast. They sent me a box with prepaid UPS label for shipment. I did not request this as I was planning to go to the local office. But since I received the boxes and shipping label, I went ahead and shipped it out on May 12th and it was delivered on May 13th. I also have confirmation of delivery to the address Comcast had on the label.Since then, I have got 3 invoices with missing equipment charges, tech visit charge, and modem charge which was ridiculous as I owned my own modem at all times. I have been called by third party companies claiming equipment recovery which I have refused and provided UPS tracking for delivery confirmation. I have wasted too much time on the phone with these uncouth business. 6/30 account is still not closed out. Comcast remains the same stubborn self not doing nothing to assist a long time customer in a positive way. Even thoughts of probably using their service sometime in the future are out of the question now."
"P. of Huntsville, AL",7/2/2014,,"In March 2014, I got something in the mail that offered my a $200.00 if I switch my cable and internet service to Comcast. In the fine print it stated that I would have to be customer for 90 days. July 02, 2014. I called about the VISA gift card ($200.00), I was told I would not get it. I pay my bill on time each month. When I attempted to call anyone at Comcast each person doesn't have any idea what I'm talking about. I have been hang up on 3 times and have been on the phone with Comcast since 10am and it's now 10:53 am in my area. Please beware of this ""so called DEAL"". I have ask them to disconnected my services. The company (Comcast) has told me I would have to pay a disconnection fee. On top of me not getting the gift card I was promise. I now hate Comcast. The integrity of this Company is shot with me. I just want out and have nothing else to do with Comcast."
"Donna of Sanibel, FL",7/3/2014,,"My Internet service was not working. I called Comcast numerous times in the past two days: Long waits on hold, transferred to other departments, calls dropped and each time I had to call back and go through the Comcast telephone maze, wait on hold and repeat all of the same information again. The last time I called Comcast, after my call was dropped again, the wait was 29-43 minutes! I was so frustrated I drove to the Portsmouth NH Customer Service Center, 5 miles from my home, for help. A male counter employee treated me incredibly rudely. He actually told me to ""go home"" when I became frustrated that next Monday, 5 days from today, was when a tech could come to my home. After he told me to ""go home"" I asked him what his name was and he told me I'd ""have to guess what his name was"" and then told told me to ""get out of here"". Verbally abusing customers is beyond appalling. If I spoke to a client like he spoke to me, I'd find myself looking for another job. Comcast actually has a written Customer Guarantee that states that Comcast employees will treat Customers with respect. The male Comcast Customer Service counter employee in Portsmouth NH doesn't believe the Customer Service Guarantee applies to him or to how he is expected to treat customers.By the way... my Internet is still not working. I have had to use my iPhone hotspot to access the Internet. So, my question is: why would I want to keep Comcast if I am treated so badly and I have to go through such frustration? I don't. I am exploring other Internet options. Sent from my iPhone."
"G. of Batavia, IL",7/4/2014,,"I was billed incorrectly in May of 2014 for 399.99 first installation charge. I HAD NO NEW INSTALLATION. MY XFINITY HOME WAS INSTALLED IN SEPTEMBER OF 2013 AND PAID FOR! I have repeatedly contacted Comcast several times a week, have been transferred, left on permanent hold and hung up on, promised credit several times, promised call backs. I can't believe they can get away with this! Someone has to be able to do something about them... Please!!!"
"Merdi of South Lyon, MI",7/4/2014,,"I have been a Comcast customer since 2001 @ Lyon Township. I paid ($87.25) for basic Internet & TV. Comcast send me a bill on June 6th, for $171.02 in June 6th. I called them to Question the Bill. They said that the ($87.25) was promotional Bill and it has expired and the new bill is $171.02. I explained that they never send me any notification at least 30 days ahead of time, if they had, I would have cancelled my service then. The Customer service Lady said, ""you do not have to disconnect your service since you cannot afford $171.02, we can sign you up for the $99.00 ""Tripe Play"" and convert your phone service from Vonage to Comcast and keep your Basic TV & Internet."" I said ""OK that sounds good."" Customer service said that the earliest they can send a technician to swap out the Old Comcast Modem was June 17. I explained to the Customer service that I will pay only ($87.25) for the Month that they had billed me $171.02. My New Bill is now $276.57, which includes charges that they never disclosed such as dispatching a technician to swap out the Comcast Modem ($53.14), and Additional Outlet HD Converter ($29.85). When I called Comcast on June 6th, I explained that my household budget would not allow me to go over the $99.00 and that is what I expected to see for the bill and if it was going to be more, I need to know since I cannot afford it. Comcast business practices are deceptive and unfair. Since I live in Lyon Township, I do not have a choice of any other Cable provider and hence I am a captive audience or better word a hostage. Comcast should have sent a written notification before changing the billing from ($87.25) to $171.02 to disclose the end of promotion so that as a consumer I would have been informed and hence had a chance to Cancel the service and avoid getting billed for $171.02. Comcast customer service who was telling me to sign up for the $99.00 triple Play who made the arrangement for a Technician to show up on June 17, should have disclosed that there will be a charge for Technician. I believe that Comcast is engaging in deceptive business practices and they practice their monopoly in strong arming consumers into paying fabricated and undisclosed charges."
"SALVATORE  of Ocean City, NJ",7/4/2014,,"A Comcast representative decided it was ok to park in our driveway without asking to perform service at another address. He never asked permission to park in the driveway and occupied the space for over a half hour. When asked to move his van, he said to get out of his face and then threatened me by saying you better walk away. Not only did he park in the driveway but he took up 2 spaces.When he decided to leave, he stopped his van to further threaten me and my wife. I filed a criminal complaint with the Ocean City, NJ police department. The incident took place in the 4800 block of Ocean City in the evening between 6:45pm and 7:45pm. Is this the quality of service to be expected by Comcast? He was not even working on our property. His name is Joe and I provided further information to the police."
"saeed of Atlanta, GA",7/5/2014,,"We had Comcast service but I noticed that our bill almost doubled at one month. I paid that since I didn't have time to discuss with Comcast people. You know how painful is that since they really don't understand simple math. The next month, surprisingly, the bill quadrupled and I stopped paying that and service suspended for a month. Today, I tried to check the account and spend some time to solve the issue with customer service and, surprisingly, I noticed that Comcast has kept charging and overcharging us while the service was suspended. This is absolutely unacceptable. I wanted to contact the law office of our college to sue this company. They may have overcharged a lot of people as well and this is a big fraud."
"Brian of Swoyersville, PA",7/5/2014,,"I tried Comcast to save a few bucks, and boy, what a big mistake. All of their set top boxes are heavily used. I should know, I ended up getting nine units because they kept on failing (what A hassle having the technician come to my house to replace these). When watching someone speak on TV, the voice lags behind the lip movement. They told me my TV was too advanced; the frame rate was too high (guess I should have saved my old TV). I noticed that the HD was not as clear as DIRECTV's, and found that Comcast's maximum is 720p, not 1080. Their DVR hardly holds any shows, they told me to get Xfinity, but then I found that all of this Xfinity features were not available in my area, and it would be a extra $20 (so much for saving a few bucks). When you call for a technician to come out and repair the set-top box, watch, because they will try to charge you for this. That was the last straw for me, when they try to charge me a second time for the technician to come out, and they refused to credit me on my bill (even when I talk to the manager, I got nowhere). All of this happened within a span of two months. What a fiasco!"
"Paula of Cape Coral, FL",7/5/2014,,"I wrote a letter dated 06/13/14 to the President/CEO Neil Smit of Comcast and then we received a call for Comcast to come out to service our boxes. I complained about the weekly outages in Cape Coral and the daily rebooting our boxes by Comcast. A technician came out per the request of the President CEO and now we are being charged $60.00 service charge as well as an outrageous Comcast bill in the amount of $355.86! We cannot afford this on a fireman salary. I am appalled by the terrible customer service and not receiving any help from the corporate office. We need competition in this area so that we have other cable companies to use other than this awful Comcast!Dec. 15, 2014 Update: We have written numerous letters to the CEO of Comcast complaining about the terrible service with Comcast. Corporate office would have them come out to service our cable per their request, not ours, and then they would try to charge us for something we did not ask for. Also, the technician would always come up with some excuse of that we would have to live the issues with the continuing problems because Comcast is going through growing problems. Then why should they be allowed to continue to buy Time Warner when they cannot handle what they have now. We also had to cancel our phone service with them because we could not depend on having a line available for emergencies! And they continue to raise our rates for awful service! The government needs to step in and do something about this!"
"Janet of Annapolis, MD",7/6/2014,,"I had Comcast when I lived in Silver Spring, MD. The service continuously went out and came back, sometimes 8-10 times in an hour. I would call, they would ""apologize"" and send someone out. Nothing was accomplished. I moved to Annapolis, MD and the service was the same. Today it has been out 22 times; sometimes I can go for several days with no outages. Both times I had so-called ""new"" equipment, different each time because I moved to different regions. I disconnected my phone; it made no difference. Sometimes the service is just so slow, my dial-up was faster. One time it took me 4 minutes to get through to open a 3-sentence e-mail with no attachments. In total I've had 6 service calls, nothing positive came of any of them. One time I was trying to file a complaint with Comcast and my phone service (I have phone and internet only) went out 5 times during the call. They had to keep calling me back. I'm so sick of this! If there was any other provider in my zip code (besides Hughes--they appear to have more problems); I would jump at it."
"Jill of Detroit, MI",7/7/2014,,"I have paid for service fee protection ($3.95) month for over a year. Each month since the service call in February I have contacted Comcast regarding a $60.00 service fee charged to my account. Four representative have said that the fee would be reversed as well as the ""administrative late fee"" associated with my not paying the $60.00 I don't owe. In addition the service tech who came to my home in February said to ask for a specific modem yet I was given one which increased my bill by $94 annually. I have been a customer for 10 years and feel pimped by this experience and will not continue to be used."
"Nancy  of Brighton, MI",7/8/2014,,"Moved in a little over a year ago to a condo that has Comcast service. A bill collector came to my door with a bill in my name for services in Aug when I purchased the condo in November. Continuous problems with service. Called the new station and they connected me with the Detroit corporate office - finally straightened everything out. Fast forward a year later, 7-7 no cable or internet. I go online at work on my account and it says connected. Had to hunt for a phone number on the website, called, told I had to talk to internet services first, call dropped when they transferred me. I called back and spoke to the internet services. 40 minutes later they said they would have to send out a tech for $60 and if the problem was on their end I could call billing to have removed, then transferred to cable and the call was dropped. Called back and they said the cable was out, to time when it would come back up, supposedly nothing to do with the internet problem. I asked to be transferred to billing - call dropped. I called back and talked to billing requesting a credit for the days I do not have service and complained and they assured me the $60 fee would be waived. I have my doubts that my bill will be correct. Talked to a friend next town over and she said the outages are all over. Someone needs to pull everyone together and take on Comcast and their dishonest business practices."
"Gary of Jacksonville, FL",7/8/2014,,"We moved from one location to another. The customer service rep. told me if went with the Comcast alarm plan, my bill would decrease, but instead my bill increased. Called back for three days in a row and kept getting jerked around and disconnected. Called back and got another person on the phone. Told him the problems. I told him I wanted to change the service to basic cable. He informed me that I couldn't do that, so I told him to just cancel all services. Come to find out my wife works from home and she has to have hard cable, so I had to call Comcast back and reconnect services. They are trying to bill me for canceling the alarm services in the amount $1000.00. Been fighting with them for almost a year now. They have the bill up to over $2400.00. I refuse to pay these idiots. They have the worst customer I have ever seen. They ended up closing this account and I was told by one of their managers at the local Comcast store that they would issue a credit on this account. She then open a new account up but still trying to get credit on the first account. These people just keep passing the situation from person to another and nothing gets done. I would stay clear of Comcast if you can. The only thing is they have the market in Jacksonville, FL and they know it."
"Tobey of Monterey, CA",7/8/2014,,"Got a call from a Comcast salesperson stating for 6.00 dollars a month more we could have basic cable along with our already internet service which totals 76.00 per month. We get a bill 2 weeks later for 107.64. They claim there was no such deal made with us and they refused to play the recorded conversation when they called and made the deal 2 weeks ago. They claimed that they are #1 across the country - HOW, by Ripping people off."
"anne of Richmond, VA",7/9/2014,,Had the worst experience with Comcast customer care. I just switched from Verizon to Comcast and I needed to activate my internet. Since from last two weeks the customer care people are coming and going and nobody can solve the issue on time. It's you who have to call all the time and get your things done. They can charge you without giving you the services. One time I had the experience that customer care was rude to me as if she didn't care. Still my internet is not activated and I am going to complain and put a review for this bad experience everywhere. I am going to make sure that they feel the pain which I had during 2 weeks without internet and constantly calling them and still no response and concern.
"Harry  of Missouri City , TX",7/9/2014,,"Comcast elected to stop internet service. When I called, I was told that Comcast had decided that the Comcast modem, supplied by Comcast, was at its ""end of life"". Comcast elected to deactivate it. Comcast elected to do this without any notification to the unfortunate person who made the mistake of being their customer. Comcast has decided it would be most convenient to Comcast for the customer to disconnect the Comcast modem, drive across town to the Comcast office, and try to trade the modem. Comcast will probably decide that it would please Comcast to charge to replace the modem. If so, lawyers will be called.This is an incredibly arrogant self-serving bit of business stupidity - one that stands out even against the slovenly performance Comcast is known for. We will select another internet access provider. Consumers would be wise to not subject themselves to the level of incompetence and arrogance that personifies Comcast."
"Scott of Memphis, TN",7/10/2014,,"I've been a customer of Comcast cable T.V. since before it was Comcast (Memphis Cable Vision, 1979). On May 31st, 2014 I ordered Internet and phone service from Comcast in addition to my cable T.V. The order came with a 30 day money back guarantee if not 100% satisfied. First, The technician who came to my home on 5-31-14 appeared to weigh in excess of 300 lbs. He was here for three hours and sat in my office chair for most of this time. I did note that he was leaning back in the chair and towards the desk. The next morning I sat down in the chair and it immediately collapsed to my right, towards the desk. The steel framed box at the top of the hydraulic lift under the seat was mangled. The chair wheels are flat on the floor and the seat is bent all the way over almost touching the floor. I rode the seat all the way from ""upright"" to its present position, hanging on with my grip on the arms and hitting my head on the desk and my right shoulder on the floor. I did not seek medical attention as I was O.K. I immediately called Comcast and complained. They gave me a reference #** and told me they would follow through and let me know. Numerous calls to customer service have resulted in empty promises, apologies, being placed on hold for long periods. switching my calls to the main number I dialed at the beginning, forcing me to start all over again with the main menu to identify myself and finally OUTRIGHT Disconnects. If Consumer Affairs would like, we could do a three-way call to Comcast customer service because this frustrating tactic is far too frequent to be accidental or unintentional. This is so often the norm, that it must be a common and acceptable practice. Now Comcast says I have 5 digital cable boxes. I have four. I have 3 T.V.'s. A number of years ago Comcast gave out the tiny converter boxes with NO monthly charge. This was when the U.S. went from analog to digital. They gave me two. I tried to return one a few years back and was advised to keep it as it was FREE and I may end up needing it in the future. I agreed and put one away. Now they said they have done an audit in June 2014 and that I had Five boxes total: two DVR boxes, the two smaller boxes and a regular HD box. (I have 3 TVs.) They could not tell me when I was supposed to have acquired the HD box. And now they are charging me for it ($9.99/month). I don't have this box, I have only the 4 boxes of which I will return one.And lastly, promises to ""Port"" my old number over to my new Comcast telephone dragged on each time telling me it will take four more days. This never happened. I had had enough. I called Comcast to request that they discontinue my internet and phone service and that it was within the 30 day guarantee. They said if they came out they would charge me a trip charge of $39.99. So much for the guarantee. I said don't bother. I was very glad I never disconnected my internet and telephone service with AT&T. AT&T came out for free and reconnected my AT&T Router/Modem and I plugged my telephone back into the proper wall jack. I am disabled and spend a lot of time at home. I need the cable TV and am afraid what they may pull next. The chair cost $240.00 and I really liked it. I had to replace it and bought a cheaper one from Office Depot, but there's a big difference in comfort. I feel that Comcast owes me the cost of the chair and a call from someone with the power to be able to correct the errors on my account. Thank You."
"anne of Davisburg, MI",7/11/2014,,"Had high winds knocking out my cable line. Made call day after knocked out and told that there was a problem in my area and would be fixed. Next call told to stay home, someone would be out the following day and to watch my cell phone from 8 a.m. No one came or called. Made another call. Told was given misinformation and no one was scheduled out until a week later. Three technicians did show up and said definitely the line. Did not fix, in fact, disconnected line. Made another call and scheduled a technician for inside so had to be home. Yep, it was the outside line - the one three technicians took down. How many days did this take - 17 days no service. And gave my cellphone number numerous times to call center because my phone is part of a bundle. Did they give the technician my cellphone number - nope! Customer service is not just about nice people on the phone. It is about resolving a problem or issue."
"Bill of The Villages, FL",7/11/2014,,"We moved on May 19th and Comcast charged us 39 dollars for a service tech to install our equipment at new location. He left and nothing was working we called for help and was told they would send someone - no one came. On 5 20 a Comcast tech was at a home across the street and we flagged him down. He came in, looked at what we did not have, called his dispatcher and was allowed to help us. In the move my wife had been told we could keep our old phone number when the service was moved. Comcast changed our number and said that was the number we were to use. Not expecting to have a new number we had send a second change of address to all of our doctors, friends, and emergency contacts. When our service was relocated, the tech that did nothing correctly, he took one of the two digital adapters with him (5/19/14). We were charged for that additional adapter on our May and June bills. When I contacted the customer service rep Shantel - she was not helpful at all. I tried to explain the tech took the adapter with him on the 19th of May and she said we were charged for it in May and June because it was still in our service until reported removed to billing. When I asked how that was my problem she said I was properly billed until billing dept was notified. I again tried to explain that the Comcast tech took it with him on 5-19-14 and that, â€œyour internal communications were out of my control.â€ She was not helpful, continued to tell me she could not adjust my bill or help me in any way.I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was put on hold twice and then finally told Comcast has no supervisor in customer service to talk to a customer. I received my call back from Philly about 20 mins later and somehow when I tried to answer the digital answers Comcast was able to understand the response. Comcast telephone service, unable to understand a negative response to their service check. HOW HANDY that is. We are currently being told that our service my working by 8:30 tonight and the call back service is not working. We have had numerous conversations with the billing department concerning over charges on our bill, each call is a promise and no change another call and maybe a change. Being a Comcast customer for 15 years in Florida and several years before that in Ohio and Ind., your service is getting worse and your customer service people are a joke. I would love to have a conversation or a meeting with someone who could at least attempt to help us. VERY UNHAPPY and have nothing good to say about you, your product, or your people. I donâ€™t expect you to exceed your promise of service but I do expect you to live up to what you charge me for. I pay most of my bills via computer, not Comcast you make it so hard to talk to anyone who help and I donâ€™t trust you or your billing systems."
"Robert of Las Cruces, NM",7/11/2014,,"The day I decided to sign up for service, I called and specifically requested a package with certain channels in it. The first person I was able to get a hold of notified me that service was not available in my area. Knowing that not to be the case, I called back and received someone who gave me a packaged cable and internet deal and requested what day I would like for installation. I specifically told them that I needed the installation to be done on a weekend because I would be going on a business trip the following week. The sales associate said that was fine and said that I was scheduled for installation on a Sunday and I verified that it was a good time. This was on a Thursday. The next morning I received a phone call to verify my installation. The lady on the phone said it was scheduled for Wednesday of the next week. I told her that I had originally scheduled it for a Sunday and that I would not be available the following Wednesday, at this point she replied with ""You are mistaken sir, you scheduled it for Wednesday, would you like to keep the appointment or reschedule?"" I kept the original appointment cause I was able to coordinate with my wife to be present during the installation. This is the first case of poor customer support.After the technician came and installed the cable, my wife called to notify me that several of the channels that I had originally requested were not available. I immediately called the 1-800 number and told them about the issue at which point they notified me that the package I had selected for install didn't contain the channels that I had requested and that if I wanted the channels that I would have to upgrade to a higher priced package. I reluctantly agreed to it and had the cable package upgraded in order to receive the channels. This is the second case of poor customer support.Thursday of that week my wife informed me that the package we had still did not have all of the channels that we needed, and that the free HBO and Showtime that was promised to me was not available either. I once again called customer support and let them know that if I did not receive the proper package that I would be cancelling my service. They transferred me to Customer Solutions and customer solutions was able to add the HBO and Showtime to my package as well as adjust my service once again. This was the third time Comcast was unable to provide proper support.The following Friday night I went to take my trash out and discovered that the technician who installed the cable line in the house had left a large wooden spool inside of my trash can filling it by about half. Finally infuriated with the situation I immediately called the 1-800 number, explained the situation, and was transferred over to Customer Solutions once again. An employee named Keeli, employee ID ** answered the phone. As frustrated as I was I am sure that I was probably irritated and blunt with her. As I explained the situation her attitude and demeanor relayed the appearance of not caring, and she had an incredibly poor attitude. At no point during the call did she offer an apology, a solution, or explain to me any of the information that I requested to be explained. I told her that I wanted my service cancelled, and someone sent to the house in order to pick up the equipment cause I would not be bothered taking the equipment back to Comcast considering how poorly I had been treated. I also explained that I wanted my 30-day money back guarantee. After she came back on the line I requested for verification that the money would be transferred back to me and she refused to answer the question directly instead saying ""I cannot speculate how it will reflect on the bill."" After further questions regarding the bill she began to raise her voice and interrupt me constantly while trying to talk over me eventually stating ""I have only tried to help you but it seems like all you want to do is argue sir."" Immediately after this I requested her supervisor's name, which is Shawn, and requested to speak with him. At this point she informed me that he had left for the day and that she would place a request to have him call me back within 24 to 48 hours. This is the fourth time that Comcast failed to offer good customer support.The next day I called Comcast back and requested to speak with Customer Solutions in order to verify that the request had been submitted. I explained the situation to Customer Relations again, this time receiving someone who was sympathetic to the situation, resolved my issues with my package, and said that the request to speak with Shawn had been submitted. They also said someone would be in contact with me regarding the wooden wire spindle that had been left in my trash. At this point I reactivated my service.The next week I contacted Customer relations again, and told them that Shawn, **'s supervisor, was supposed to have contacted me within 24 to 48 hours, and we were going on day 4 with no contact. The representative stated they would resubmit the request through ** and that the supervisors had been in many meeting throughout that week. Three days later, Monday July 7th 2014, I contacted Customer Solutions again, this time telling the representative that I wanted to speak with their supervisor, they stated that the supervisor was not available and that they would instead submit a request for their supervisor to call me back as well as resubmit a request, for the third time, for **'s supervisor to call me back and that it should be within the next 24 to 48 hours.Yesterday, which was Thursday, July 10th 2014 I contacted Comcast once again and was finally able to get a hold of a supervisor in billing. The supervisor notified me that Shawn was not reachable, and offered me discounted packages which included DVR and home phone (both of which I have absolutely no use for). I told the supervisor that Direct TV was offering me a package that included internet, Television with more channels, and NFL Red Zone for the upcoming season for $79. The supervisor attempted to see if he could find a comparable package that included NFL Red Zone and was unsuccessful. He informed me that he needed to do more research, and that he would call me back in approximately 25 minutes. I laughed at this and told him I didn't believe him. He assured me that he would be calling back within that time at which point he would discuss it with me further. I have never heard back from him."
"June of Knoxville, TN",7/11/2014,,"My Comcast internet started going out about a month ago quite regularly... every night about 10-11, and most days. I called and had a tech out, and it's still going out. I think they are shutting it off, as it goes off a regular times, not really intermittent, like they somehow know my schedule and shut it off during the day. However, my kids have been staying with me, and that's not a normal thing, so they don't have internet now during the day. And I used to go to bed by 10, but now stay up to midnight, so it's as if Comcast thinks I won't be needing the internet at these times and shuts it off! I'd try the cheaper AT&T U-verse, but I'm afraid it won't be fast enough to watch streaming movies. Well, what the heck, I can't really watch much streaming as it will go off during the movie...."
"Ray of Naples, FL",7/11/2014,,"After a lengthily hold, pressing several numerals (in English) I had the wonderful opportunity to listen to some awful music three times in succession. After speaking to a rent a service tech. I was told to hold and she would transfer my call. She ""AXED"" me several questions, and success my call was dropped!!!!! Being persistent and P.......Ed Off I tried again, pretty much a repeat of my first call. So I said I'll give it one more shot. Lo and behold guess what happened. My MIGRAINE kicked in I decided to take a break and try again tomorrow. Well I tried again this time asking for a supervisor!!! After listening to that dreadful tune again for several times the agent got back on the line, and said the supervisor was busy, please hold a little longer!! I did and once again the call was dropped.A tech came out to install wiring for a second tv. I called and complained about a grainy barely viewable picture, and the problem was resolved by installing the splitter properly. I could go on and on about my experiences with Comcast. They obviously make a lot of money, and are trying to bring Time Warner into their company. If FTC allows this shame on them. All of this took place in Naples, FL off season. I can't Imagine what it would like when the customer base is 50 times larger. All in all I think Comcast needs a total overhaul. I would like to run this company for 6 months. Surely the unemployment rate would rise drastically!!!"
"Merle of Atlanta, GA",7/13/2014,,"In November 2013 I purchase a 2012 LG tv. After a few weeks, the tv began to have problems. The signal began making the TV not receive the information quickly. Comcast was called. The tech repaired. However, a few weeks later the problem surfaced again. Comcast was called. We are now in January 2014. Each time Comcast needs to troubleshoot the system even though it was recorded since Nov 2013 the problem existed. Now had one older tv purchased in 2001, no problem with the signal but the newer tv had the problem. Comcast finally repaired it February 2014. There was no conversation when I signed the approval of the repair I would be charged after services were completed. I was not notified prior to completion of services there would be a charge because I didn't have Comcast service plan if something went wrong with their system. When I pay my bill late February there is an extra charge of $55. In billing there was no notification prior to services being rendered there would be a charge. Have attempted 3 times to resolve this issue to no avail. During these times a request was made to return money for services not rendered. Nothing appreciable. I have paid my bill except the $55. July 12, 2014 they turned off services. I attempted to resolve this 3 times and guess all staff has been told we can get some customers fall by the wayside. Even a customer who has been with them 7 yrs and have paid the account on time most months."
"Tonia of Graniteville, SC",7/14/2014,,"The customer service from this company was substandard to say the least. When I could not get a problem resolved with the front line workers and asked several times, to several different people I might add, for a supervisor, that request was never granted. Only after I called back to cancel my service was I taken seriously. By this time, it was too late, because I had gone with someone else. The service was okay, but the customer service from this company is the worst I have experienced by far."
"Tevi of Morrison, CO",7/14/2014,,"I was your customer for many years until I sold my house on May 31st, 2014. I called mid-May 2014 to ask you to forward my service to my new home at **. I was told I had to wait 5 days to see if Comcast serviced that area. Comcast called me and said no they don't service the area. I asked if I would have to pay the termination fees and was told NO. I was also told that you would send me boxes for the equipment. I gave the address to send the boxes three times and they never came. Instead, I received threatening phone calls about the equipment mid-June. I took the equipment to one of your locations because the boxes never came. On June 17th I called in to pay the balance on my account. It said $59, so I paid it. I then received a bill in the mail from you for $305 so I called in again and was told the balance on my account was $0.00. I then started getting calls from a collection agency, Diversified, who said I owed Comcast $305 so, again today, I called in and spent over one hour with your company who disconnected me three times and sent me to several different departments, billing, collections, customer satisfaction dept (?). Each department told me something different. I was told my account was switched with another person named Ryxxxx who got my payment instead, and then I was disconnected by Comcast. I called back and was told they don't know what I am talking about and I was told that I never made a payment of $58 (PLEASE SEE PROOF OF THIS PAYMENT FROM MY BANK). I was then told I owe the money and that's final!!"
"jodi of Woodbridge , VA",7/14/2014,,All of a sudden our internet wasn't working. I went down the the office and a Comcast employee said we needed 2 routers instead of 1 so that myself and the woman I rent a room from could use 2 different signals. Well that didn't change anything. I went back again and they said they needed to send a technician. The technician came out and said there was faulty wiring in the basement and he changed the wires. I purposely asked him if we would be charged and he said no because it was Comcast's fault. About a week later the lady I rent the room had to call Comcast because her son's ps2 wasn't connecting properly which again was Comcast's fault because they now said we didn't need 2 routers. So after all of this we got charged a $40 service call charge. When I called I was told the only way I could get that taken off was to subscribe to $3.95 a month protection plan. So to sum things up I went by the Comcast office 3 times (once because they didn't give me the power cord to router) had a technician and the lady I rent from had to stay on the phone with them for over an hour to fix their mistake. We now have to pay them $40. Comcast is a rip off. Wants consumers to pay for their mistakes.
"Jon of Mexico, MS",7/15/2014,,"I got my internet speed check and highest it got was 0.02 at 3:00pm - 2:30am and at the middle of the morning I get to 3.00 internet speed, so that mean I cannot go on internet unless I want to stay up all night."
"Katy of East Grand Rapids, MI",7/15/2014,,"This company is a joke! I LOVE cable tv and there are no other companies in the area that offer cable tv. Against my better judgement I signed up for comcast. I knew they were a horrible company to work with but I just really wanted cable. Previously my parents had problems with Comcast and when a technician came out to fix the problem he also stole sunglasses and money.I started having problems with my internet about 4 weeks ago. I hesitated to call for help because I knew it was going to be painful....and boy was I right. I was put on hold for 20 minutes, when tech support couldn't help fix my problem (by restarting my router) they transferred me to another dept, another 20 min on hold. When I explained AGAIN my problem to the new department they tried to transfer me back to tech support. WOW! I made an appointment for a tech to come visit me- had to take a vacation day from work because it was a 4 hour window. Technician did not show up, and did not call. Again, I didn't realize a company could stay in business working like this...but I guess when there is no competition they can do what they want.I called again a week later and set up another appointment- again a no call no show. I called yesterday to cancel my service and was transferred to a total of 4 departments with a hold time of more than 30 minutes each time. When I explained I also needed a credit to my account because my internet was not working I was told I needed to call back to speak to the billing department (another 30min hold wait), and shockingly the billing department's systems were down. I still am trying to call and get credit to my account for 4 weeks without internet- each time I get another excuse on why they can't credit my account.Bottom line- I don't have cable anymore which sucks, but I also don't have to deal with Comcast so I think I win. AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS!! Hopefully ATT will provide service in my area soon."
"Sheila  of Albuquerque, NM",7/15/2014,,"I have been having with my Comcast Phone etc. (I have a bundled package) for 2 years now. In addition, I have paid for a service protection plan all along as I was told that I needed it to avoid the charge for a visit to me. However, it is a Comcast problem not my problem. The last technician checked and my neighbors who use Comcast also have the same problem. He said it is their own cable, not my lines. However, I can't get anyone to fix it in spite of my many calls and the many hours I have wasted. I am still losing phone calls, I can't hear other person, they can't hear me, overlapping conversations, yet I have been paying for service and been complaining for two years now and not getting service. Friends and family complain about not being able to hear me. I have gotten some credits after calls to Comcast but some credits were for Comcast errors in billing and some other reasons which I won't take the time to go into here.I want reimbursement for the unnecessary payment of the Service Protection PlanI have been an 8 year Comcast customer but this does not seem to mean much to Comcast and will probably get worse when the merger with Time Warner is complete. Two years of lack of decent service, the many hours of my time wasted between the many phone calls to Comcast and the time when useless Technician visited my house and no resolution is more than enough. I will be looking into other alternatives to Comcast unless the problems are fixed immediately."
"Kathy of Wheaton, IL",7/16/2014,,"So many hidden charges in their $119 bundle. My first bill was $370! My salesperson promised 3 different times to correct it. Yea, not so much. Still fighting with them while they keep adding late charges. My internet went out and they came to change box. Guy told me they recycle boxes and can't count on them to be functional. We were out of service 5 days, had to wait for service window (1-4:00) and then they charged me for service call. I am currently waiting for another service call for home security. It's been out for 10 days. So sick of the bs. HATE this company."
"Kim  of Oakland Park , FL",7/16/2014,,"I called the other day to review my current bill and package. Had a difficult conversation with rep with thick foreign accent. As I repeated to her what she said, more features, no equipment charges... $109 a month... she transferred me to another area for the phone line that I repeatedly said I did not need, ""but it was part of the package"". She stated that if this part was not completed, the order would not go thru. I just had this feeling that she was not correct/or leaving something amiss... So after being on hold, I hung up. I got to pay my bill today, and I was charged for new services. TRIED to call today to discuss and am getting nowhere. Forget about getting a supervisor. I am going to remove all service now - when I finally GET a person to help me."
"Irene of Newbury, MA",7/17/2014,,"I had to smile at the latest public exposure of Comcast's attitude toward customers (The viral bit about the customer trying to cancel his account). Actually, the smile came when I read Comcast's public statement about this latest fiasco. The response was supposedly written by Tom Karinshak, Senior VP - Customer Experience. I've heard numerous people saying they feel sorry for the agent involved in this debacle because he was most likely only doing as told by his superiors. I suspect there is truth in this assumption.Our problems with Comcast began over two years ago (TV and Internet). After months of trying to get someone at Comcast to care about our problems, I contacted Corporate. They assigned a senior level employee (their word) to help. This was almost a year ago. Since then, numerous techs have come out to ""fix"" our problems. Each tech finds something s/he says is the cause of all our issues. The ""something"" is fixed and the tech leaves. An hour or two later, the issues reoccur. Comcast keeps sending out senior techs who find new problems and ""fix"" them. At this point, they have replaced just about every part of the system and yet the service issues remain. Meanwhile, getting anyone at the Company to respond to e-mail or telephone calls takes days and even weeks. Keep in mind, by now we are dealing with people at the Corporate level, not the low level field reps.We are very frustrated and fed-up. Every month the bill must be paid, but no one seems to care that we lose channels in mid-program or that our Internet connection is often slower than old-fashioned dial-up. A month ago, we sent another letter to Mr. Karinshak explaining our frustration. We have heard nothing. However, after talking with friends and doing some online research, I now understand why. Mr. Karinshak may be in charge of customer experience, but he never sees any negative feedback. He is so well insulated from customers he has little or no idea how poorly his company is fulfilling the terms of the ""customer guarantee.""([I'm not sure you can call mere words a guarantee!) If Mr. Karinshak wants to know how his company is performing, I suggest he make himself more accessible. Read the forum posts. Allow customers to e-mail him directly. Spend some time in the field listening to customers. Not all of us are cranks or people bent on dragging a company through the mud and muck. Some of us are simply frustrated and desperate to be heard by someone who will effect meaningful change."
"LUIS of Weston, FL",7/17/2014,,"BE PREPARED WHEN CALLING COMCAST: After long waits, they will shift you from extension to extension and suddenly it gets disconnected! For four consecutive months I tried to get a refund for extra charges that appeared on my bill, reps always said it was done and I would receive a credit which never happened. This took me to browse AT&T and found that the high speed internet and phone line that I have would cost me 3 times less! When I tried to cancel Comcast, it was almost impossible to cancel!"
"Eric of Seatac, WA",7/17/2014,,"This happened several years ago around the mid-80's. My father wanted cable tv routed into the basement guest room. The installer had to cut a hole in the drywall to access the cable but he did not return to repair the wall damage. My father said nothing. Years later, I complained to my local Comcast office (Seattle), sending them pictures, and being told that this would be investigated. A year later and still no action from Comcast."
"William of Warren, MI",7/18/2014,,"I just got Comcast less than a month ago. They said that there would not be a charge for installation because there was not a signal. Second bill there was a $30.00 charge. They will not take off. I called when I got the service to make sure my next bill was supposed to be. I called 3 times and got 3 different quotes. Finally, they said it will be the same. I received the bill and it was double. They said that there was nothing they could do. Bye bye, Comcast."
"Cindy  of North Little Rock, AR",7/18/2014,,"Every time I have had to call Comcast after about 5Pm, it has been a nightmare. You get canned responses and nothing is ever fixed. I've also had problems with being ""disconnected"" when talking to customer service during the day. Who knows what that is all about, but somebody needs to start up a new internet/cable company. Seriously, Comcast needs more competition. Eventually I get things done, but have just about decided I can live without internet and cable TV in my house. Every year it gets more expensive and it's just not worth it."
"mary of Lawrenceburg, TN",7/18/2014,,"Comcast is responsible for canceling the tv series (EUREKA). I truly hope they lose any and all customers, I want nothing to do with them!"
"James of Harriman, TN",7/19/2014,,"This is the post I put on my personal Facebook page 7-17-2014. I'm posting on the Comcast corporate Facebook page as a warning to anyone considering Comcast as an internet/cable provider. Also to offer legal proof that I am aware of my bill behind due 7-20-2014 but will not make a payment until my bill is adjusted correctly. Any attempt to charge me a late charge for not paying an incorrect and probably illegal charge will be documented also. I have given Comcast ample time to correct this error and have been met with total disregard.Update: I paid $120 to Comcast today 7-19-2014 which is less than they say I owe but more than I actually owe. I told them to put a note on my file that I was disputing the charges. Only time will tell if I'm charged a late fee or not. Well alright then, here is the scoop on my Comcast saga. It will soon become obvious why they have taken control of the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE of any corporation in America.6-1-2014 @ 7:39pm - Called Comcast Customer Service (19 minute call) to report a problem with my internet and they scheduled a service call from between 8:00 and 10:00 am on 6-6-2014. 6-6- 2014 @ 2:00 pm the Comcast serviceman arrived 4 hours later than scheduled. Was unable to fix the problem, but was told I would have $20 credited to my account for them being late.6-7-2014 @ 9:38 am called Comcast back (26 minute call) to say I was still having problems with internet service. Was able to talk to an intelligent person who updated the router firmware which fixed the problem. He also, because of the problem the day before and the continuing problem that he fixed, offered to double my internet speed and lower my bill from $140 a month to $90 a month for a year. I agreed and checking on speakeasy found that my speed had, in fact doubled. 7-14-2014 Went online to pay my bill and it was for $267.95.7-16-2014 Drove to local Comcast office to discuss bill. Was told that they were unable to make any changes in the bill, but the girl did itemize the bill and said at least $67.75 was a double billing and was an error. She gave me a number to call. At 4:20 pm called Comcast billing (46 minute call), the first person I talked to said that the bill was correct and there was nothing they could do about it. When I mentioned the $67.75 double charge, they acknowledged it was an error, but said that they weren't authorized to fix it. I asked them to connect me with someone who was authorized to fix it. The next person was a little more helpful, but said that they were unable to do anything either and that I would have to talk to someone in Customer Satisfaction. The first thing this person told me was that the bill was correct and that I would have to pay it. When I asked her about the $67.75, like the other people before her, she acknowledged that it was incorrect, but she didn't have the authority to remove the charge. I went over the previous story about how I changed my service to get the lower rate and her response was, ""Well, honey, you are getting a significant discount for what you are getting."" I told her that I was only interested in getting service for less than what I was already paying and not more. After 30 minutes I was able to finally get her to remove all of the extra services to where it was before, however she was unable to get the $67.75 removed. (WTH?)7-17-2014 After checking my bill today the charges had dropped to $176.25 which is still more than my usual bill of $140.00 and since I was somehow supposed to have an additional $20 removed for them being late on 6-6, they are charging me at least $50.00 over. I called Comcast again (19 minutes)and got someone who sounded like Garrison Keillor. (without being too prejudiced, I imagine him to be an Episcopalian carrying a Costco card). The first words from his mouth were, ""well sir, I see we've already given a significant amount of credits to your account."" That was enough. I demanded to talk to one of his supervisors. He said wait a minute and put me on hold. Five minutes later he came back on and said a supervisor was about ready to talk. Five more minutes later he said that I should wait another day or two and that the credits should appear on my bill. I told him that I wanted it put on my account that if it wasn't below $120.00 by the time the bill was due that I was not going to pay anything and that I would be bringing my modem/router and cable box back to Comcast. He said he would do that."
"Lori of Berlin, CT",7/19/2014,,"We had our bundle cable, internet landline for almost 9 yrs. I always carried credit with this company as well. I am owed $398.27. I returned all their equipment and they gave me a receipt saying they had all of it. I would have my refund in 30 days. Now 30 days later I call and they try to say there is equipment missing. Issue a ticket **."
"Deborah of Stone Mountain, GA",7/20/2014,,I was told I didn't pay my bill in full the previous month. I had to get my checkbook to let them know my bill was paid in full. I also asked about numerous fee charged to my account which no one would answer. I was pass to several customer service representatives and still did not get my questions resolved.
"Merritt of Akron, OH",7/21/2014,,"On a phone call to Comcast to resolve internet and TV problems, I agreed to a new two-year contract for some small savings. I knew I might move before two years elapsed and directly asked about early termination fees. The representative responded several times that no early termination fee would be applied if I moved somewhere that Comcast does not provide service. Indeed I did end up moving to a location not served by Comcast, and they did apply an early termination fee. When I challenged the charge, I got shuffled from place to place in their system at considerable expense of time. They refuse to withdraw the charge, or review the recordings they make when customers agree to contracts over the phone.I was a customer for nearly 10 years. The charge was only about $30, but it's the principle of the matter. I would never have signed a new contract without express guarantee that termination fees would be waived if they could not continue to provide service. So whether it was intentional lying on the part of contract seller or lack of knowledge on their part is not material, Comcast refused to stand behind a contractual agreement made by their representative, or investigate the matter.When service was terminated, they said my email account would disappear in a month unless a friend added our email to their account. The email account disappeared within a week in spite of assurances. Unexpected loss of an email account is a big deal, but too much time had already been lost to void of Comcast already. Conclusion: CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES, in spite of being polite and sounding knowledgeable, CANNOT BE TRUSTED, AND THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY. To be clear, the actual internet/TV service would degrade substantially or go out every 6 months to a year and the problem was slow to be resolved in large part to the time commitment required to penetrate their customer service ""defenses"". So the concerns above are not the only problems, just the ones in violation of trust."
"Sean of Saint Augustine, FL",7/21/2014,,"Can you blame Comcast for taking advantage of their virtual monopoly to squeeze customers as much as possible? Yes, I can. I signed up for a 6 month promotional $19.99/month data plan. After repeated difficulties getting set up, my service suddenly cut out about a week later. I made the mistake of calling customer service, and when they couldn't resolve the issue over the phone, they scheduled an appointment with a tech at the soonest possible time (after the weekend). First of all, I probably should have done some research (which I would have, had I internet service)  to discover that I could have avoided this problem by having your wireless router clone your computer's MAC address to avoid the way Comcast tries to get you to use their equipment by making it tricky to use your own. Had I known that the tech was going to play with the splitters in my apartment for an hour and then I was going to be billed $40, I would have made sure the appointment got cancelled, or just pretended to not be home.Lessons learned: Comcast doesn't want you to try to figure out how to avoid renting their equipment, and while it is tricky, there are plenty of other pissed off customers out there who will offer advice how to do it. NEVER let techs come into your home unless you really hate your money. Try to figure it out yourself if the folks on the phone can't immediately help you. Comcast will screw you any way they can, but you don't have to make it easy."
"Steven of Round Lake Beach, IL",7/21/2014,,"I updated my cable TV service and added a cable box. During the change of our package the sales team asked if I wanted to keep my number. I said yes. They changes it anyway. But the system did not change it and keep it associated to my account. They rated my number as addable even though it was tied to my account number. They removed it from my account and overwrote the system to give me number to a new customer request. Mind you, they did not have hardware and still don't 5 days later. I let Comcast know right away when they disconnected the number. They never said sorry or offered any fix. They hung up on me and my wife. They transferred the number with my voice mails on it and 3 days after my voice mails, message was still on the line! The MOST INSULTING THING IS THAT THEY VIOLATED MY RIGHTS TO THAT NUMBER OVER 4 TIMES AND NEVER ONCE FIX THE PROBLEM OR OFFER ANY COMPENSATION."
"Mimi of Brooklyn Park, MN",7/22/2014,,"I sold my business and want to cancel Comcast. They still charge me for the cancellation fee, and their reason is ""we still provide service to you""?!? I talked to the rep and he asked why I don't transfer our service to the new owner. I HATE Comcast so, so, so, so, so much. In another business, I have service with Comcast also. Their internet has been failure almost every month. TV service doesn't work. Phone line is bad. I will cancel contract with Comcast by the end of this year and never recommend any friends of mine to Comcast again."
"Al of Cumming, GA",7/23/2014,,"Comcast charges me $150 for one month internet access. Claim I had used over 600 gb of data. Prior to Jan. 1, average usage was <300 gb. No behavior change in our house and they would not produce daily usage logs to support billing. Brutal customer service of no help. I will be canceling and switching to U-verse."
"Marie of Belleville, MI",7/23/2014,,"I contacted the customer service line and was again transferred from agent to agent with lengthy hold times and the outsourced Indian agent was unable to assist me.Meanwhile, I have been saddled with overage charges on my cell data plan as I rely on wifi services to run my Contractual business. They still haven't been able to arrange an appointment to transfer services and I am waiting for a call back to reschedule despite my pronouncements to end all services. Comcast Infinity in my opinion is a conglomerate of bureaucratic red tape idiocracy with crappy out of touch disconnected and outsourced menial phone center techs who cannot understand or meet the service needs of the market. I will be exploring other options for my technological needs as Comcast appears ill equipped in managing what ought to be their very forte."
"Samir of Chicago, IL",7/23/2014,,"I had ordered Xfinity TV and internet service through an online promotion that included the Preferred (220+ channels) Double play cable TV and 50 mbs internet for $89.99/month for 1st 12 months and would increase to $119.99/month from months 13 through 24. I made sure that a cable card was in the order (at $0 per month) since I wanted to use my own TiVo box. When the install guy came out he did not have the cable card and wanted to connect Xfinity's own dvr box instead. He claimed that Comcast is no longer sending out cable cards for TiVo boxes and they no longer support TiVo... which were all false statement based on phone calls I had made with Comcast prior to purchasing TiVo who all told me a cable card would work with their service. I made another call to Comcast and after being on the phone for over an hour finally got it straightened out and they would have another install person come out within 30 minutes. That person never showed up so I went to their service center on Milwaukee Ave. to get the cable card myself.Well when I got to the service center it turned out that Comcast had modified my plan to be only internet with no TV channels and they weren't going to honor the online promotion that I got. Through more hassle of maybe a few hours more they added the TV back on to my service... but now I have to have to install my TiVo myself with the cable card. I then looked at my account online and discovered that they had added an additional service fee of $39.94 plus three $20 fees for each service even though I had requested only TV cable and Internet. The original deal was a $39.95 install fee and $0 service fee that I got from my online promotion. I then also discovered that they weren't giving me the ""Preferred"" plan that had added channels. They were giving me the ""Starter"" plan with less channels for the same price of the deal I had.I've probably spent a good 8 hours dealing with Comcast and the service is poor. No one can do anything or resolve issues. If they could only honor the plan they had got initially and had my service working like it should be there would be no problems. I would never deal with them in my life, and I would tell anyone to stay clear from Comcast. They are a horrible company that don't care about their customers. The poorest customer service I have ever experienced in my entire life!!!"
"Brittney of Hephzibah, GA",7/23/2014,,My bill was never steady. One I paid 138.00. So the following month it was 577.23. What the hell happened ask them they during research no service changed or anything. So Deetta ** called me from the credit department and gets nasty. I'm not paying 500 for cable.
"ì•„ë¡  of Duluth, GA",7/24/2014,,"Never deal with Comcast or Xfinity!!!!! I ordered Comcast internet plan - comes with local 10 channel + internet up to 30mb for $29.95 over the website. A month later, I have the bill of $97.31 so I call Comcast (Xfinity) to adjust. But I was transferred 3 different department and they said all different stories and they never had that plan (then what was the plan I made order online???). One of assistants came up with $34.95 so I agreed to pay that amount.To get their prepaid $50 credit card, I had to pay the full amount of $97.31 so payment status stays fine and I did not have to pay second bill and third bill which would be less amount that I paid. I paid full amount and I got second bill, total amount of $58.68. I called bill department again because I should have had zero amount of bill. What they said is they don't have the plan of $34.95. What??? I had to start everything again and again. They played and tricked customer like this and I have to call every time I received the bill. I could not take their words again. I never had this wonderful and ridiculous service ever. I ended up paying full amount and cancelled the service. Please do not use Comcast or Xfinity. If you do, they will bring tremendous headache. It was all about system. How come you guys come up with different price plan every time I call and never keep promise about whoever helped me and made note on the system. Now I do not even trust that they made note. If they did, how come they have all different stories talk to. Why was I paid $97.31 and why should I keep local channel for which I don't need. I never hear whoever fool pay $97.31 for internet service nowadays. I guess I was fool enough to order your internet service without knowing all this hassle.I don't know why you guys doing this to me. Today (7/24/2014), I got a call from Comcast and offer me $29.99 25 mbs download speed internet and she told me to get a credit for first bill I made, I have to call bill department so I called. An assistant in bill department told me that in order to get credit, I have to talk to cancellation department and remove the bundle service then I will get credit automatically. So I talked Tasha in cancellation department and she told that they don't have plan $29.99 internet by itself, it has to be with local TV bundle $39.95. It was plan every assistants told me every time I transferred. And I told what happened from the beginning again. I waste another two hours for nothing. It is really ridiculous. I cannot take anymore and I cannot trust anybody's words from Comcast.Do not deal with Comcast!!! I made many calls and received many calls. Sounds like they can do better but do not let them play with you. They will give you same damn plan. I paid $150 for using service for 1 month. I will not making same freaking mistake."
"Ian of Northbrook, IL",7/24/2014,,"Only company that could provide service in my area so, against my better judgment, I went ahead with them. Unable to get it done online (interaction #1) because the ""chat"" person could not set me up without charging for the ""home installation package"" which is just a bunch of wires they send to you that everyone already has (scam #1) So I call on the phone (interaction #2) and the associate tells me I need the faster package that's $49.99 instead of the advertised 3/Mbps pkg. advertised because I have a lap-top (scam #2). I refuse and tell him I want the $19.99 and tell him I have my own modem and will set it up myself. He can't transfer me to set-up person so I have to call another number (interaction #3). I call and the tech ""sets it up"" and I'm able to go to 2 websites which ""confirms that it works fine"" (scam #3). Soon after, I realize that it's going on and off and timing out b/c it's just not working. Call back (interaction #4) and trouble shoot with another tech for 30 mins or so and she says ""everything is fine"" but it isn't. I ask is my router supported? She says ""yes"". So I have to have a tech come out to the house (earliest is in 3 days). Tech comes out (interaction #5) looks at modem and says ""everything looks good here"" goes outside and replaces some ""really old equipment"" but does not specify say what he did then says ""okay...everything's good"" before I have a chance to double check, he's gone (scam #3). Called 3 times that night (interaction # 6, 7, 8) and all the reps say they spoke with a dispatcher and the driver will call me to come back but he never does. Call another rep the next AM (interaction #9) and in 10 seconds the rep says ""oh, you have an outdated modem, you need DSSI 3.0"". So I go to Best Buy and buy a $130.30 Motorola modem (because I'm sure as hell not gonna give those bastards at Comcast the monthly rental fee for one of theirs) bring it home and call Comcast (interaction #10). The nice lady began the process and I quickly became disconnected. I call back (interaction #11) and another lady walks me through the process again and after 50 mins still cannot get it working. I immediately ask her to transfer me to cancel my service to which she nicely says sure and apologizes for like the tenth time. I'm on hold for 15 mins when she come back and asks me my zip code?? (Which I've uttered no less than 20 times throughout this sage) and apologizes again. Another 20 mins go by and I hang up. I call back (interaction #12) and am waiting on hold for 8 mins (promised 3-5 min wait from the automated lady) and lose the call in the elevator. I call back (interaction #13) and ask to be called when the rep was ready. They call back (interaction #14), and I cancel the service. I demand (politely) that I be billed nothing for this fiasco (m.b. guarantee per the TV ad) and she assures me I won't. Is the saga over? Will I be billed? Only time will tell. I think I was apologized to 30 times (no exaggeration) over these 14 interactions. However, it is just window dressing. A thinly veiled attempt at feigning good customer service when not one person I spoke with really attempted to fix my problem."
"Marjorie of Chicago, IL",7/24/2014,,"I signed up through Comcast's online service for their advertised Internet Plus package for $29.99 (25 mbps internet, 10 TV channels and HBO). When I got my first bill, it showed a $69.95 package. I immediately called and wound up on hold for nearly an hour. Then I was told that the package I signed up for was no longer available but I could get a similar package for $34.95. I was SO frustrated after speaking with 3 different people I was ready to cancel my service. My husband (who installed the system) convinced me to at least give them a shot since everything was already installed.As we speak, I am on hold (and have been for an hour now) waiting for someone from Customer Solutions... since they are apparently the only department who can help. This is my 3rd day in a row trying to reach Customer Solutions... I usually give up after being on hold for an hour. This is complete BS... This company and their customer service SUCK! I DO NOT RECOMMEND COMCAST!"
"Nick of Chicago, IL",7/25/2014,,"Absolutely terrible customer service... I am a new customer and placed an order with Comcast Online for their Double Play Package. This package was advertised to include a $100 prepaid gift card. After I placed the order, an agent from the online department called on 7/22/14 to inform me that the package was no longer available and I would not be receiving the gift card. The agent acknowledged that Comcast did advertise the gift card but her department could not issue me a credit. Then I went on a terrible experience of explaining the situation in numerous departments.... I spoke with Supervisor Jose in the Sales Department and then he sent me to Joaneshia in the Online Sales Department and then she sent me to the Loyalty Department. The most frustrating part of this process is that each agent is not willing to help, rather than try to sell me the triple play package (includes phone). Comcast falsely advertised their services and makes it impossible to speak to a dedicated customer service department. All I am looking for is what was originally promised and advertised online.... $100 prepaid gift card! If I wasn't bound to Comcast through my condo association, I would cancel my new order for service and switch!"
"Sandra of Monroe Twp, PA",7/25/2014,,"Update to my previous post... a year and half later we had to move due to a house fire.. I moved in with a friend. I cancel my service with them as I obviously no longer need it in a burnt house. I return the DVR box (not sure it would work after the fire but they wanted it).I call for final bill. I sent in the balance over 2 or 3 payments due to financial issues after the fire. The last final payment was made a year ago! - Last month I get a collection letter! I call Comcast telling them My balance was paid in full a year ago!!!???? Yes, it looks like I have a zero balance on my account. They tell me to call collections and they have an $83 change on my account for paying my bill late!!They knew of the fire and they knew I had to send payments... then they bill me a year later in a collections account letter!!! It is in dispute and probably on my credit report now.."
"Sonja of Auburn, WA",7/27/2014,,"Comcast has been a thorn in my side for years. When I changed service from my previous address but left it connected and transferred to my roommate 6 years ago, it took 4 months to get the $150 over I had paid (because I pay my bills before they are due - well never again with them). I have continuous problems through the years with my internet connection (I pay for top of the line). Then amazingly when I call them and complain suddenly they stop slowing it down. I have reset my router 3 times in the last 24 hours and still was having spotty connection, until suddenly when I logged on here, my Netflix works again. Think I am paranoid - no, I know how these big businesses behave, and they are very capable of tracking all of the data and calls (why do you think the government gets information from them?)."
"Frank of Beachwood, NJ",7/27/2014,,"I began having issues with my internet from day 1, but recently was the best of the worst. I had issues for about 15 days straight, and had 'bullets' sent to my modem at least once a day. So about 10 days ago a tech came over. Now since I disconnected my modem overnight the stupid thing decided to work when the tech connected it. I asked for a replacement since it was at least 10 years old and he wouldn't so it wouldn't come up as a service call which made no sense at all. Today I called, wasted 35 minutes and tomorrow they will replace it, only because I didn't want to waste my time driving 20 miles round trip, or want to pay a fee to have it mailed. Why would I pay a fee when they told me itâ€™s an outdated piece of equipment. I am paying good money plus insurance to have proper service. You want me to go pick it up? Have it closer to me. Comcast is the worst. I am seriously thinking about FiOS just to get some upgrades for a few years. By then maybe some good from NY might come down."
"rodd of Stafford, VA",7/27/2014,,"Have had Comcast for TV, Internet and Cable for years. Cable box and modem have been replaced more than 10 times for mechanical and troubleshooting diagnostics. Service has been out for up to 4 days because tech did not come out. Tech was dispatched when all services were out (I explained there was no phone service as Comcast was provider and service out). When no-show, called and was informed tech was canceled because I didn't answer the phone! Called back, spoke with supervisor and repeated there is no service and do not call before coming out! Third and fourth day, same thing, no show because no-one answered the phone! Stupid or what? When tech finally arrived, found problem outside with Comcast equipment (I missed 4 days work without pay and Comcast offered $20 dollars)!Problems continue: dropped calls, no dial tone, frozen cable TV, DVR not recording. Noise on phone and cable outages every week and sometimes daily. Have had techs out multiple times for problems and calling tech support sometimes take hours to talk with tech. DVR is not working now and phone dropped call today. I have talked with management and was told they would replace cables outside, but no one has come out to follow-up on service promise. I have refused to pay bills until they get service to work without interruptions. So far, they have not had service for 1 week without an interruption! When service is out, 911 calls are also out as there is no cell service in the area.If Comcast put 1/2 as much interest in quality service as they do billing, they would be #1 in service and not at the bottom! They are the monopoly here and they know it! While talking with service department last week, failures occurred and call was dropped. I had asked to have a callback as this happens much of the time. No call back ever occurred. Today is 7/27 and TV and phone have had problems all afternoon. Service asks that customer disconnect failing units to have a ""Power Reset"". This garbage fails almost daily and I refuse to unplug it anymore!"
"D. of San Jose, CA",7/28/2014,,"After 12 years with AT&T DSL, my neighbor recommended Xfinity Blast. So I called the first phone # I found for Comcast. I was offered a promotional offer for Blast Internet with unlimited nationwide phone for 49.95 a month. I agreed to the bundled package while writing down the details on paper so I know what I signed up for. The installation charge would be 49.95 also, I clearly remember (and wrote down on paper) that both numbers matched, monthly charge and install, both 49.95. The week after the install, a bill came for the wrong amount. After several attempts to rectify the matter by phone, I was told that the promotion does not exist. On top of that, I didn't even have Blast internet, which I specifically requested based on my neighbor's recommendation. I feel I was blatantly misled to sign up for a lesser package at a higher price than quoted."
"Toni of Naperville , IL",7/28/2014,,"Don't ever get this company (Comcast). They will lie and tell you everything, you'll have this channels and that. Plus it took them 4 weeks to install the internet and TV and half of the channels were NOT working. Then you call to get all fix and guess what? I still don't have it done but you'll be owing them money. They want me to pay $196.00 for something I didn't have, and $711.00 for the equipment that they told me they will come and get it. I can go on and on about the customer services. They are THE WORST COMPANY TO BE TRUST. Overall with comcast, I don't know why people having them. I just hope they will go down soon or someone else open better company."
"J. A. of Stafford, VA",7/28/2014,,"We received a phone call to offer us Comcast Triple Play. The offer sounded good and we could finally get all of our services under one company. Beforehand, we had Verizon for our phone service and our phone bills were way too high. We decided to sign up for Comcast Triple Play and our initial service call was on 2 July. The installer came and placed three new set top boxes in the house with new controllers. I asked about the internet and phone, but he said that wasn't his job and someone would call to set up the rest of the services. Within 36 hours, none of the cable boxes were working. This was a disaster---World Cup Soccer was on and we weren't able to watch it! My husband called a toll free number for Comcast and got someone in NY that talked him through getting at least one of the set top boxes working (it took nearly an hour). On 7 July, another installer came out to take care of the internet connection for us and he did a great job; apparently the first tech that showed up didn't complete the job correctly and left quite a few issues unchecked. When he started looking at taking care of the phone connection, he was totally flummoxed due to the fact we have a security system with two lines. He couldn't do the job---and at least he admitted it. (Note: We asked for a tech after 25 Jul as we had company). The next installer arrived on 27 July and started to take care of the remaining internet issues (which I thought were completed). He was here nearly four hours and at the end of it, the only thing he accomplished was to re-establish the phone lines with Comcast from Verizon. He was unable to complete the job due to our security system which has two lines (one goes directly to the police). We were assured that we would have a tech out today to finish the process, but after two phone calls (leaving messages) for the supervisor, we still have no idea when the tech will show up. Needless to say, my husband is livid that Comcast is so inept and said that we shouldn't have opted for their Triple Play offer. Unfortunately, I'm beginning to see that he was right---although it seemed a good offer to save us money. Not sure that it is worth all the aggravation and wasted time."
"Rene of Franklin, TN",7/29/2014,,"Let's face it... we all know that cable companies are an oligopoly in the US and they should all be at least fined or at most be in prison for their business practices. Bottom line: they sneak charges on your bill. We have the HD Complete XF Bundle with the X1 DVR system. With this system, we have the X1 master DVR in the living room and are allowed up to 3 additional HD outlets for free. We have 4 additional outlets in our home and should thus be charged for one additional outlet per month. Well, this month, our bill seemed much higher than usual and lo and behold, out of the blue, they started charging us for 4 additional boxes at $9.95 each. I have been live chatting with them for over an hour and the woman who is likely in India or Pakistan keeps telling me that the extra charges are for my X1 system. She cannot resolve the fact that this is a NEW CHARGE on our bill this month.Prior to this problem, we went for 4 months without functioning DVR service. We were on the phone with Comcast weekly and they kept telling us that the problem would be resolved within 24 hours. Finally, we had to pay to have a technician come out to our home. He said that they had given us equipment that should have been sent back for repair. So, the previous guy had taken faulty equipment from another person's house and gave it to us. Isn't that lovely? Here's the best part: guess how much they refunded our account for having their crappy malfunctioning equipment for 4 months? Have you guessed?$7. Mind you...this is not even a $7 discount per month. It was a total of $7. After screaming and fussing on the phone, I decided that my blood pressure and sanity were more important because I was getting nowhere with them! They argued that they provided the services as they had promised but that we were unable to take advantage because of the faulty equipment. I am not kidding here. But we only had faulty equipment because one of their technicians gave it to us!So, what am I going to do about this? Absolutely nothing. But why you must surely be asking yourself, would I not do anything!?! As stated in the introduction, we have no other options. The cable companies represent a legal monopoly. Last I checked, the US was still a free market environment but yet the gov't is allowing this oligopoly to continue. If y'all want to band together and rise up, I will stand with you. In the meantime, I will spend the next hour or so on hold with India because they have still not resolved my issue over the past 20 minutes it took me to draft this review."
"Ronald of La Vergne, TN",7/29/2014,,"I was having problems with my wireless internet being slow. I called in and a wireless technician did some troubleshooting and found that my modem needed to be replaced. After being transferred, the person told me I could get the modem in 3 - 5 days. I said that was unacceptable, why can't it be shipped sooner, he hung up on me. I called back in, and mind you, you have to go through identifying yourself every time you call back in after going through the annoying automated system. I get another person who says I can get it overnight, great I'm thinking. After two days and no modem, I called back in. All I was given was a UPS tracking number and after putting it in, I found out that it was going to be delivered in six days. I get the new modem and after installing it, my wireless was still slow if not slower than when I first called in, so here we go again. More troubleshooting for an hour or more just to hear him tell me his resolution was for me to buy a modem with my money because my slowness issues were due to outside interference and not under Comcast control. I just happen to have a degree in networking and told him his resolution was not acceptable and got hung up on again. Here we go again. Call back in, spending another 40 minutes with another tech and his resolution was the modem was more than likely bad, and they needed to send me another one. After being transferred this tech tells me I don't need one, I need a tech to come to the house. My frustration level at this point is out of control. I did some research on the type of modem, I did my own tweaking and my wireless problem is solved. Comcast is about to become history as I am switching providers. I can't stand to be lied to and spending hours on end calling back in to hear more lies."
"Autumn of Charlottesville, VA",7/30/2014,,"I was a Comcast Cable customer since 2007 at the address I am currently at. Before that address I was a customer. In the past 6 months they have raised my rates three times. When I called to talk with them about it they explained that I was getting too many channels for the price I was paying. I told them I had a package they sold me. They told me ""it was their mistake"" but I had to pay for it. How do you make a mistake for 7 years? I told them I would not pay what they were trying to charge. I had it turned off. I will never do business with them again. You would think that after being a long standing customer that they would try to work with you?"
"Shawnequa of Little Rock, AR",7/30/2014,,"I had the absolute worst experience with Comcast on yesterday. I called to do a simple transfer of service. Well, guess what, it wasn't that simple. The young lady, though nice enough, screwed up my account. My transfer was not supposed to be until Saturday but my service at my current location were suspended yesterday by the time I ended my call. Had she been more concerned with setting up my account than talking about her deadbeat baby daddy for thirty minutes, maybe she would not have turned off my services 4 days too soon.I called back at 2:03 pm CST to get this issue resolved and all hell broke loose. I first talked to Shay. She told me if she turned my services back on I would have to call back again to have them disconnected on the day of my transfer (stupid, right). I told her I was not going to call back because I should not have been turned off in the first place. I then asked to speak to a supervisor. She purposely transferred me to a different department (the sales department) and I was on hold for about 45 minutes. Andrew answered. He was rude, and refused to transfer me to a supervisor. He instead purposely transferred me to the wrong department (billing) again. I was on hold for about 30 minutes. Now I am in the billing department. Mind you, I have a 0.00 balance because my account is set up for auto pay or should I say my account was set up for auto pay (cancelled that). The rep in the billing department does not speak or understand English very well. I asked to be transferred to a supervisor and he refused unless I gave him access to my account which I refused since he could not help me. So, he hung up on me. It's now 3:45 pm CST and I have nothing resolved!!! I call back and ask for a supervisor. I get Corey. He is rude, can't help, puts me on hold after I repeatedly told him that I did not want to be placed on hold and then still does nothing to help me. I finally just said, ""Forget it. Cancel the account. Disconnect all services."" Well, Corey can't do that either. He transfers me to Customer Solutions. I speak with Christy. She deserves a raise and a promotion. She is the only Comcast employee that I spoke with yesterday that has more than empty space between her two ears. I have to admit, by the time I spoke with her, I was beyond pissed and irritated so yes I had a very bad attitude. Throughout the conversation, she was very professional, helpful, and never lost patience with me. She was able to get my services restarted, and was able to set up my transfer correctly!!! By the time I got off the phone with Christy, it was 5:45 pm CST. 3 hours and 45 minutes to fix an issue that your rep caused is more than ridiculous. And for your reps to have the nerve to have an attitude with me because I demand quality customer service just like you demand on time payments is a slap in the face.You can keep your Comcast Guarantee because it is nothing but lies. Your guarantee should say ""We promise to feed you a bunch of lies every time you call, place you on hold for as long as we like, take forever to resolve your issues, refuse you the right to speak with management, and bill you extremely high prices because we can!"""
"Vanessa of Odenton, MD",7/30/2014,,"So, without giving a full essay... I hate Comcast. By far the worst customer service I've ever experienced. I have lived outside of the country and never experienced such a gap in basic communication. It seems as if none of the technicians have any expertise in... anything. I've had billing problems. The first time I had my equipment installed it was the wrong equipment, and to have it fixed, guess what... a fee! So when I moved recently I decided to upgrade. Stupid. They messed up my order, disconnected my equipment a day earlier than I scheduled, never called to confirm, and gave me a lame excuse that ""Someone would call with a new reconnection date."" Oh and by the way... the upgrade sentenced me to two more years with them... YAY!"
"shanna of North Fort Myers, FL",7/31/2014,,"I cannot connect to internet and my equipment is fine. No problem there and my account balance is paid every month but Comcast's internet service is down most of the time. I have been a customer for a couple of years and I have complained to Comcast numerous times in the past but get no satisfaction. Now this time, the internet has been mostly down for a week and I can only use the internet for about 20 minutes a day if I am lucky. All my equipment is new and up to date just like Comcast ask me to do but I am still having problems. This has been and is a common routine and Comcast does not give a damn. I am sick of paying for services that I cannot use and I cannot afford the installation fees for another company. I think customers should get some kind of notice and/or explanation for why service is down and when it will be up again and I think they should give customers some kind of credit for services they cannot and have not been able to use for a week or more."
"ANNA of Rohnert Park , CA",7/31/2014,,The network keeps dropping me at 30 minute intervals. It's difficult to stream anything because the router needs to be reset 2-3 times every night. So frustrated at the audacity of Comcast to claim to be the best internet provider when they don't deliver.
"Ajay of Burnsville, MN",7/31/2014,,"I have been with Comcast for more than four years with only minor complaints. I wanted to cancel my service last year because their promotions ending every 3 months and spending hours to get new promotions to keep my bill in check. I was convinced by the rep when I called to cancel that he will give me promotional rate of 139.00 for 24 months. I asked about early termination fee if I move, and was told they can move my services free of charge and if they do not have service in the area, there will not be any termination fee. Lo and behold, after 9 months of contract, I called their moving services and asked to move my services. I was told that they do not have services in that area but their partner company Charter can provide services. I contacted Charter and got my services installed. Now the phone tag and nightmare of cancelling Comcast has started. Today I called them and ask them to disconnect my services and was told that there will be an early termination charge. I tried explaining the situation but to no avail. I asked to speak to a supervisor but they don't have one so I was put on the call back list!! Now our moves should be decided by the cable company contracts and not the job offers. Would not recommend Comcast to anyone if there are other other options. Bad luck if no other options!! Stay away from verbal commitments from Comcast reps as they will mislead, deny everything and will not take ownership."
"Rita of Washington, DC",7/31/2014,,Why have on the website that you have 24 hour service. When I called at 6:00 am your electronic voice says that you are closed? You make it hard for a person to speak to any customer service person. You are so convoluted in your advertisements. I probably will change service eventually - I cannot wait. The public have other choices.
"Ina of San Mateo, CA",3/1/2015,,"I wish I could give it 0 star. The customer service is just non existent. Every time I call for any technical question, they start trying to sell me their crappy additional services that I don't need. My bill has been constantly creeping up with no explanation whatsoever. The customer service is rude and incompetent. The worst part I don't have that many choices. I had Time Warner when I lived on east coast. Their customer service couldn't even go in comparison with Comcast. This industry is totally monopolized."
"Jake of Stone Park, IL",3/2/2015,,"I have dealt with plenty of Comcast's/Xfinity customer service and technicians over the years. Yes, there were plenty of times where the reps were rude, not knowledgeable and I don't even want to mention getting stuck in the IVR maze and transfers. This is my first public review and complaint about them until today. Today their negligence and complete disregard for their customers pushed me over the edge. We manage IT services for many companies and municipalities and utilize Comcast for transport and service where needed. We deal with Comcast customer service on almost a daily basis.It all started this morning when I received a message from one of our customers that the internet is down. I thought well nothing unusual since outages are a common problem for the area where the customer has service. I called Comcast Business Class Customer service at 800-391-300 (forgot to mention this is business class service) to see if there were any outages. Before I was able to speak with a rep, I received a text from my customer informing me the service came back on. IVR did not report any outages in the area either during my call. The outage in the morning lasted a whole 4 minutes, not long but for a business that does online sales, very annoying. When 12:10 CT came around, I received another text from my customer reporting again the service is out. So as before I picked up the phone and dialed the CSR number, but this time when the rep answered, I was informed my account was disconnected. I was in shock, asking how is this possible, the rep informed me that it was a voluntary disconcertion. Raising my voice out of anger, I demanded an explanation and was told this morning I requested the service to be disconnected. On top of it all, she stated there is a note that I called in January of 2015 inquiring if there is a contract on the account. I'm the only one that is authorized to make changes to the account and never did I even call to inquire about the contract term. The service at this location was active for over two years. I have stories collected over the years about Comcast, billing mistakes, modems being accidentally removed and deactivated, unauthorized charges, etc. If I had to count all the hours wasted dealing with them, it would add up to months and not to mention all the stress and aggravation dealing with this company. Thank you for taking the time in reading my story. The service location for this particular customer is in Bensenville IL, in the commercial park near York Rd and Foster."
"Hayley of Douglasville, GA",3/2/2015,,"We had our service transferred from one address to another. Comcast failed to bring the billing info over to the new account. We contacted them to discuss the fact that they were charging us $200 in ""Non-Returned"" equipment (which was used at the new house and installed by their technician (an additional $200 for the ""installation"" when everything was already set up from the previous tenants). They still did not set up the new account with the auto payments so they turned the service off. We decided to go with a different provider because of the incompetence and because after we moved, the internet was so slow at the new address that we couldn't stream anything because of ""Buffering"".1 week AFTER they turn our service off, they hit my debit card $327+ (even though they ""had no card on file"" for the new address) which in turn overdrew my account. I called to speak to someone about this and was told by the lady that she had to transfer me to ""Billing"". I have now been on hold for the Billing department for over 30 minutes (no kidding, my phone says 31.10 and I still keep having to listen to the elevator music and hear their recording stating that my call is important to them and asking me to please continue to hold and a representative will be with me shortly).This is just how important we consumers are to Xfinity/Comcast. They mess up not just once but twice (by not transferring all the details from one location to the new location and by not fixing it when we called about the ""Unreturned Equipment"" that they ""installed"" at our new place). Now for the third time I am trying to get things straightened out and I have now been on hold for 36 min and 31 sec. Horrid Customer Service, Horrid Experience!! It is now at 42:31 minutes and still on hold!!!!"
"Jerry of Cartersville, GA",3/2/2015,,"We were with Comcast for 3 years. While they are a very efficient company to provide service, we just had a lots of outages. Our subdivision is 26 years old and I feel the cable is being compromised by its age to provide a good signal. We always had a good rate for our Triple Play Service, but reliability was main reason to go with another service. We also had a tremendous with the Scientific Atlanta Equipment. In 3 years we had at least 10 HDVR's to be exchanged."
"mich of Rrston, VA",3/3/2015,,"Comcast XFinity TV complaint. After issues with digitizing and tiling since November 2014, an appt was scheduled for 02/28 after an online chat session 02/22/2015. Here's the sequence of events, and no resolution to date. 02/28 - 0759. Technician arrived in the driveway at 0759 and then promptly left. We have the van on security camera backing out without the tech ever coming to the front door. Nor did the technician call the provided contact number given to ** the week before, **. 02/28 - 0915. Called Comcast customer service to attempt to find out where the tech went. Placed on hold numerous times, then rep could not find the csr or appointment. Hung up on me.02/28 - 0942. Called Comcast customer service, to attempt to find out where the tech went. Placed on hold numerous times, then rep could not find the csr or appointment, or the account. Smarter now, so I provided csr ** and account number. Then rep found the appt, but said we cancelled it. No, because we confirmed it on Thursday morning via automated call to **. Then rep wants me to schedule another appt. No. Asked to speak with supervisor. Got placed on hold again, then disconnected.02/28 - 1002. Called Comcast customer service again to attempt to find out where the tech went. Placed on hold numerous times, then provided csr ** and account number to rep. Another rep found the appt, and was going to patch us into the local dispatcher. Hurray! Someone who knows how to find something. Oh, but wait.... during ""patch in"" hold, click, and then nothing but dead air. Dropped from their call again at 1015. I gave up after three calls and an hour.02/28 - 1130. Contacted chat customer service and explained the situation, repeated calls, hang ups, disconnects and still no tech. Rep wanted to schedule another appointment. I told this person to come and get their equipment and to cancel service. Rep disconnected from chat. I still have no cable reception that is acceptable for the cost they are charging. ** said that after the tech visited they would ""evaluate the account and refund partial."" Sure they will."
"Jim of Knoxville, TN",3/3/2015,,"My Comcast ""nightmare"" began January 16, 2015, when I signed up for new service. **, salesman with Comcast at 5720 Asheville Hwy, Knoxville, TN 37924, explained a two-year plan but later I discovered he signed me up on a six-month plan? He quoted me a price of $125.64 a month. I have called him six times and left message on his CELL PHONE (his office does not take INCOMING phone calls?). It took three scheduled service calls to finally get an installer out. I spoke with ** in Stone Mountain, Georgia three times when they tried to change the third date to a FOURTH date. I demanded they keep the third date. The first installer who arrived was in a big hurry. (He was very inexperience. He was more concerned with a ""pigeon"" he had in a box in his truck). He moved two of three phones to the opposite side of the room, one on a very short cord, which I spent almost an hour re-wiring the next day. The third phone was in my kitchen, he said he COULD NOT connect it, although it had worked OK for years. He also installed the WRONG cord on one of my TV's, which created a ""snowy"" picture for the next three days until the second installer came out. Three days later the second installer arrived. He spent less than one hour correcting 9 of 10 problem left by the first installer. He re-wired the two phones and wired the third phone in minutes and said the first installer just didn't want to take the time? He also replaced the wrong cable on the TV which corrected the ""snow"" problem. During that day, THREE Comcast trucks showed up, each about 2 hours apart. THEN THE BILLING PROBLEM BEGAN. I received an email stating the monthly bill was estimated to be $148.00 a month, then an email showing a previous balance of $235.38? Then an email showing a new balance of $351.34, including the old previous balance. I phoned and after spending several minutes on their AUTOMATED phone system, I spoke to ** (in INDIANA). She was the first person who seemed to know what she was doing. She explained the salesman had written up the wrong plan, which should not have charged an installation charge. She corrected the plan to a 24-month plan and removed the installation charge. She said my monthly bill would be $128.97 TOTAL including all taxes and charges. NOW I get a new email which shows the installation charges removed, BUT a new balance of $291.39 (not the 128.97 as promised). On 2/27/15 I began trying to call ** (YOU CANNOT TALK TO THE SAME PERSON TWICE). I phoned from noon to 6 PM, TWENTY ONE times with NO CONTACT. Each time, I went through their automated system (and had to listen to their COMMERCIALS); was told to stay on the line for a representative. Monday, March 2, I began calling at 10 AM. After talking to several people and leaving my phone #, I get a call from ** from the corporate office, who REFUSED to help, but would only QUOTE policy of a DOUBLE BILLING THE FIRST MONTH. I was never told of this, going back to Jan. 16. ** was a VERY ARROGANT person. She promised someone else would call me back---but, of course, no one has called!This service has been totally MISREPRESENTED. I spent yesterday filing a complaint with the FCC and the Better Business Bureau (I had seen on the internet, the only way to get results from Comcast is to file a report with the FCC). My balance should be $128.97 TOTAL for the first month and each month for 24 months, NOT two months the first month. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ALMOST 7 WEEKS."
"Beatrice of Elk Grove, CA",3/3/2015,,"cable company to be allowed to mislead seniors, take advantage of us. Need help in resolving this."
"Ted of Riviera Beach, FL",3/4/2015,,"In the beginning...There was installation. I was quoted one price and charged $40 more. This was mitigated by the installer being 4 hours late and being credited $20 against the $40 they overcharged me. So I moved from a condo with free basic DirecTV that I upgraded with pay channels and a DVR, then went through a local company for internet access (great access from a fly-by-the-night ISP, I clocked them at 70+mbs).I moved to a condo that offered free basic Xfinity (Comcast) TV. So (even after past miserable experiences) to go with the free stuff...who wouldn't! So I got it installed (as described above). I will say that the internet and wireless access has been flawless for two months (color me shocked!). But this DVR is crap! It's slow, laggy, and the controls are counter-intuitive. When something doesn't work as expected and you keep pressing the ""OK"" button (because of the God awful lag), it deletes your program! I'd kill to have my DirecTV DVR back. It worked exactly as you expect. Comcast has obviously cut too many corners on hardware."
"olivia of Dillon, CO",3/4/2015,,"It is quite insulting to be told to be fair in the account, when their customer service representatives have been nothing but fair!!! In addition, 'Angry' in the rating is an understatement. I am beside myself that I was transferred over 9 times!!! I spent a total of 5.5 hours on the phone until I finally got a supervisor, who was not understanding at all, but was able to explain that it was my property management company that I needed to speak to for services. This is great info, if I would have received it from the 1st rep, not after 5 hours of being on the phone and speaking to the 9th rep. Overall, this is the worst service I have ever received; the reps don't know anything about other departments and do not follow through. They are happy to transfer as soon as they can. Certainly they do not go above and beyond. They are unwilling to help and incompetent! When I asked the supervisor what he can do for me as I just spent 5 hours over 2 days on the phone with them wasting my time and energy, the supervisor said he cannot do anything at all. Truthfully, I can't blame the individuals, only the company for not giving them the training or the tools to help potential clients. Extremely disappointed and livid about my experience with Comcast!!!"
"Jared of Sinking Spring, PA",3/4/2015,,"For a service that I pay for I would expect it to work when I choose to use it, I never had this problem when I wanted to watch a movie on Dish, and when you call customer service forget about it. Comcast what a joke."
"kim of Houston, TX",3/4/2015,,I cannot count how many times I have problems with either my phone line or internet. Call customer service and reset refresh no fix. I have turned in my modem 4 times within 2 years just to receive a refurbish equipment. 7 years with this company because it has monopolized the entire state of Texas. Channel television package each month channels disappears yet paying the same price. This company is disgraceful you call customers service and they hang up on you if questions are too complex. Now I have to wait a week for a technician but my bill still has to be paid on time. I wish verizon fios was offered in many market at this point.
"Joy of Morgantown , WV",3/4/2015,,"In December of 2014 I set a payment arrangement to cover my bill. I was going out of town for the holidays and did not want to forget to pay the bill. The payment arrangement was set for December 21, 2014, my bill was due on the 26th. The funds were removed from my account on the 14th of December and again on December 21st. I called Comcast, explained the situation and was initially told there was nothing they could do to refund my money! SERIOUSLY? I work in customer service at the management level therefore I know there are ways around policies. I asked to speak with a supervisor. After speaking the supervisor I demanded to speak with his manager. After taking an hour and 30 minutes the manager apologized for the inconvenience and agreed to refund my money in about 14 to 21 days. I was not having it. It took them no time to remove the funds therefore I did not feel 3 weeks was an appropriate time period for the refund to process. I pressured the supervisor and after all the hassle the funds were refunded in 4 days. Comcast will make mistakes and will try to offer no solution. This company has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I am anticipating the day I move from this college town to a metropolitan area with better cable and internet options."
"Lee of Sarasota, FL",3/5/2015,,"Comcast/Xfinity SUCKS!! ** should be fired on the spot! I didn't leave the chat, This dumbass ** closed the chat!! This is like the 3rd time going to Live Chat with NO RESOLUTION!!!! Xfinity SUCKS!!! Plus, their internet speed is SOOO SLOW compared to FIOS. I already have business FIOS and they couldn't even get my xfinity modem to work, which the first guy said it should work anyways. I just got sent a new modem to me today from them and it still don't work. The month since I ordered is ticking away and yet to even get any internet service from XFINITY. I'll make sure to make a blog post, so I can leave a review for others to read."
"Elysia of Sterling Heights, MI",3/5/2015,,"Comcast, your service really makes you the ABSOLUTE worst company ever! I can't understand how you continue to succeed in business by providing the worst of the worst customer service I have ever seen. No one can help solve a situation, you need at least 10 phone calls with multiple hand-offs where you need to repeat your story again and again and again... well you get it. I am sure you have all experienced it.You are willing to take our payment, did not apply it to the correct account, kept an old account opened when they were supposed to close it and now service is not working. Comcast, or Xfinity - whatever you changed your name to in hopes of having a better reputation, instead of a name change you need to have a business consultant come in or take a few customer service classes or let customers speak to managers who can make a decision or help fix a problem. Billing transfers to support, support transfers to billing, get it together! Instead of the associate not being empowered enough to determine what needs to be done on the phone calls, they all seem to abruptly disconnect. Why not just get a manager, someone from billing and someone from support on the line to hash out the issue, determine a resolution and then take action. This would cost you, the company, less time and money, the customer less frustration and your reputation might actually improve.Other businesses would not be as fortunate (if that is what you want to call it) to still be making a profit. The numbers we have been told to call (not transferred to) include: 866-200-6733, 800-325-7264, 877-896-8678, 877-842-6622, 866-203-8766. We have made multiple call backs (mostly due to disconnections). At what point can customers bill you for their labor in trying to get your assistance on a service you provide? That would be a fair, after all, you charge rates for connections and support depending on what it is."
"traci of Kennesaw, GA",3/5/2015,,I had a tech come out to my house in Jan 2015 to install internet. When all done he cut three cable wires that were next to the splitter that I ran under my house to set up the TVs when I rearrange the furniture in the living room and one in my daughter's room. When I called to tell them they cut the cables. They told me I'm a priority and someone will contact me within 24 hours. 24 hours passed I called again. They said the same thing. I waited for phone call nobody called. I called again they said they will have someone come out and fix it. Then three days later I get a phone call and left a message saying that it's not their job to fix it. I need to call DISH the people I have my television provided through. I told them that she is not the one who cut my cable wires for my television. Comcast did it. Comcast needs to fix it.
"doug of Sacramento, CA",3/5/2015,,Every night my service dies and I have to call Comcast XFINITY to have them reset it! It is costing me a fortune on my cell phone! Comcast has no clue why and will do nothing to keep me online! I have had this problem for months and ** has even left messages for ** asking for help but nothing! Still no service in the evenings! So what does one do! I plead and beg but nothing! I am wasting a lot of money trying to keep Comcast XFINITY on line and for what? Bad Comcast!!!!
"Polly L. of Kingwood, TX",3/5/2015,,"March 5, 2015. I have had service with Comcast since 2008. The customer service reps and supervisors are very rude. If you have questions about your bill, no matter who you talk to, you get a different answer every time you call. I have been trying to get my account since January 15, 2015. I still have not gotten it resolved. They overcharge for their services. You would be better off with Suddenlink, DirecTV, or DISH Network."
"Ben of Denver, CO",3/5/2015,,"On 2/24/2015 I made a payment to Comcast for a bill due in the amount of 280.00$. I thought that was very high for a cable bill when I barely watch t.v. so I decided to contact them and see if I could reduce my bill. I was planning to downgrade but the rep says that they had a special going on for Colorado residents and it should also reduce my bill. I agreed and set an install date on the 2nd of march. When the Tech came out he installed some of the equipment, but two of the boxes he had were lost in the system and he could not activate them. After he left I tried to connect my video game system back and realized that he left with my HDMI cable. I called Comcast back to get the last two boxes and they told me I could pick them up from a Comcast center or mail them to me for an extra charge of 17.00$. Well I'm trying to reduce my bill so I decided to pick them up but while speaking to the rep I was told that my signal was very low and they would send another tech out the next day. The rep told me because the tech is coming out he would bring me the 2 boxes I needed to finish the install. Day 2 3/3/2015, 2 techs showed up to troubleshoot my internet connection. For 2 hours they tracked mud and snow in the house and one of them kept entering other places in the home were 1 there was no cable and 2 I had personal things out where I was not comfortable with them being around. They claim they fixed the problem, but once again they did not have all the boxes. I call Comcast again to get the last box and it just gets worst. The first thing is that I was not on my account to order extra boxes, so now I'm going through hoops to get this straight to get my last box. This time I was told that my signal was still weak and she noted to have the tech install a booster to help my signal and send a box. So today I had an appointment from 1-3. Never seen the tech that claimed to come out to the home...only seeing foot prints half-way up the driveway in the snow. No info was even placed on the door to show they came but got a call from them on the phone I used to call them which was not even on the account to contact me. I don't even know how they got this number. I end up calling them again to see what was happening. I get a rep and first they tell me that the tech was at my home and he was not able to leave me a box because it was not his job. Second the rep claims I had cable boxes connected that the techs never deactivated when installing the new boxes. I told her to look at my package and to make sure all devices match what was on my package because they were charging me more for boxes I didn't even have. She showed signs of confusion so I asked her to let me speak to a supervisor and she said that I could not and one would call me back in 20 minutes. I asked her to transfer me to anybody because of the...of issues she was causing and no help. She would not. So I just hung up called right back. This rep was ok. She went through my account and fixed all the errors she found but seen that my bill was all jacked so she sent me to billing. I'm with billing...know this guy is just reading and repeating the notes from the last reps and still could not fix the problem. I asked him to send me to a supervisor and he did. WOW! The first rep I talked to said she could not transfer me to one. Why I get lucky this time? The supervisor handled it well and corrected the rest of my problems and set me up hopefully for my last appointment on 3/5/2015. Overall I would choose not to use them, but they are the only ones that offer DSL. But I will use them till this contract ends and replace them with a DISH and use my cellphone as a hot spot."
"Ron of Skokie, IL",3/6/2015,,"I called Comcast because I notice something was sent to collections on my report from them. I never had Comcast before. I'm not a customer and just want this off my credit. I've been on hold for 35 mins, transferred from department to department and still, no answer. Now I'm on hold all over again. They keep asking me for a freaking account number. Seriously?? Still no one. Pushing 40 minutes. I'm not even a customer. I can't imagine being one either. I WILL NEVER BE A CUSTOMER!! I hung up, called back, same thing..."

They have charged me for the 1st 2 techs last year ""which they did not fix problem"", charged me for mailing me new cable boxes but when the techs showed up said I didn't need them and took the boxes with them. I've had promises and rudeness when I call in"" which is at least 2 to 3 times a month begging for help with these issues"".

"Patricia of Belcamp, MD",3/7/2015,,"Signed up online for new service, scheduled installation (confirmation email received). Installation day, no one shows up. Call customer service, they can't help because it is a new sale, transfer to sales. Sales can't do anything to account, told to go to local store. Go to local store, they see the account. They also see a cancellation with no reason listed. They can set up a new service, but they can't give same 'deal' as online. Only option is to go online and start over. No thanks, they lost my business."
"Sylvie of Hollywood, FL",3/7/2015,,"Very leasy guy. Don't forget, the Comcast hire subcontractor to make the installation. I can believe that. All the job was done by my brother.

Now I decide to keep my old installation and I continue to make a complaint about this companies of the... Be prepare to have a problem with this cabbage companies."
"Carry of Hyde Park, MA",3/8/2015,,"I called Comcast to up my internet speed. They told me I would have to pay 12/month for 50 mps. I did not know I was only getting 25 mps with my regular service. I tested my upload/download speed with their utility and I wasn't getting anything better than 32 mps. I called support and spent a total of 10 hours on two calls with tech support. The second call I was transferred 6 times. On the first call, the tech kept saying they could not see my device online so I was not connected to the internet. I told them I was on a VOIP line so it was impossible that I wasn't connected to the internet. This conversation went on for 30 min. I was on a 30 day trial for a new contract. I had been a customer for 17 yrs. They were going to send out a technician but I insisted that I not be charged for this visit no matter what the outcome. No one would commit to that so I canceled the visit. On the day that the visit was supposed to be canceled a guy shows up at my door saying he is with Xfinity home security. He explained that he traveled 2 hours to get to my house and had paperwork that said I called. I told him we don't have the security package, never did. He sat with me for almost an hour and agreed that this was all a major blunder but said to go ahead with the new product installation as I was dropping Comcast and if I wanted to come back he would personally handle the contract. I said fine and the following week had their major competitor installed. Since install I have consistently had 58-63 mps with the internet and that's with 4 laptops, 1 Ipad and two phones. In addition, the competitor bundle of internet, TV and phone is 15$/month cheaper than what I had been paying for all three. Also, I have HD coming in on my TV which I did not have with Comcast. Have to admit that the new service does have less channels but for the price and service it is worth it. Besides, we don't watch a lot of TV anyway."
"s. g. of Milltown, NJ",3/8/2015,,"We moved in here 4 months back. First our modem was connected to someone else address for more than a month and it took them nearly 1 month to fix it and send someone. Then it continuously goes off 20 times during in a day. As a consumer we don't have a choice as Optimum is not a provider here, only Comcast. Why is monopoly allowed?We had Optimum previously in our other previous town and they are the best. They will be there to fix anything within an hour even during Sunday. When there was no power they put a battery to make the Internet work. Now that is what I call service. Comcast really don't care as they know you do not have much choice except get internet from them. I am not sure what the councilors and Mayors are doing about this kind of monopoly."
"Robert of Tualatin, OR",3/8/2015,,"Last week my monthly payment was short as I have the account set up to pay direct from my bank account. Comcast terminated service without any contact or notice and it was until I called them that I discovered this. Turns out my kids had rented two movies without my knowledge using On Demand. I spoke with three different people in Customer Service and they agreed to turn service back on if I agree to pay the balance within 7 days. Two days after the agreement they terminated service again. Shoddy, deceptive, underhanded service that nobody can do anything about because they have the market monopoly. I terminated service with Comcast after being a customer for several years in 2008, as they could never get the billing correct and kept terminating service. One month the bill would be $215, the next $46, but it was never what was agreed in contract."
"Bryon of Pueblo, CO",3/8/2015,,"I originally had made a call to possible get a credit on my account because my internet was acting very slow in the mornings around 1 or 2 a.m. That issue was resolved with no problems so far. I was also interested in upgrading my services. That is where the issue began. I was told by the first representative that my final bill after the upgrade would be roughly $105 dollars INCLUDING taxes with a 2-year contract. I agreed to this. I was then offered an upgraded receiver box, which I accepted on the clearly stated grounds that it would be at no charge with no additional fees whatsoever. I was also told I would receive my new services immediately before the box arrived. Everything sounded good. I waited for my services. Nothing. I called back and talked to another rep who told me that I had to wait until the box arrived for me to receive my new services. Very inconvenient at this point.I finally receive the new box in the mail. I install it correctly. It will not activate correctly. I call and talk to a 3rd rep. The rep could not fix it. She started to get very rude with me. I demanded to speak with a manager and she denied me. I asked repeatedly, and she denied letting me speak directly to a manager. She attempted to fix my service by adding HD service (which I did not authorize her to do). This did not fix the problem. I told her I didn't want to be charged for any type of HD services. This was never mentioned by the first rep that there was any type of HD charge with the upgrade. She said they were going to see what they could do to compensate me for the problems. They eventually end up scheduling a technician to come to my house with the charge waived. I agree. The tech arrived the next day. The box was faulty, as I had suggested to the rude 3rd rep I spoke with for nearly an hour. Tech swapped out the box, service was fine. I call back to have another rep (4th) tell me that I am being charged for the HD which I did not authorize. I figured that I would deal with it at my local Comcast office so I could deal with a person face to face. At this point, I am ready to cancel my services. I make a complaint on Twitter about Comcast. A verified corporate profile @** offered me assistance and never followed up. I made another complaint via Twitter and @comcastcares directly messaged me. I talked to 3 different reps through direct message with this account and they told me HD was included in my package. I was never told this. I was told my bill would be roughly $105, not $117.They offer to compensate me 1 year of HD for free. How can you compensate me something that was secretly included in my package and they admitted was included? They said my bill would be $99 before taxes, with taxes making it roughly $105. They were deceptive and weren't actually changing anything from the original price that I agreed on with the first rep. The Twitter conversation slowly took place over the course of the last 4 days, very, very slowly. My issue is currently still unresolved."
"rosa of Atlantic City, AL",3/9/2015,,"I have been a Comcast customer for over 15 years. Customer service have declined. I had appointment March 5, 2015. They never showed nor did they give me a courtesy call. I called, inquiring about the technician. She told me he had to cancel Due to the weather. I ask the women, ""Why didn't anyone call and inform me?"" She said they did. I told her, ""No one called,"" so she reschedule for the next day. I am waiting and waiting so I called. She said, ""They're running late. They're coming."" Another no show. I called and insisting on speaking with management. She put me on hold for forty five minutes only to get back on the phone to tell me her supervisor was too busy to answer the complaint...he would call back. The supervisor never called back. I work from home so I lost money because of this. This company is horrible. I think the problem is the language barrier."
"Claire of Nashville, TN",3/9/2015,,"I've had Comcast for almost 2 years due to there not being any other options in my area. I haven't had major problems aside from random charges and increases on my bill. For the past month and a half, however, my internet stopped working completely. We had the basic Internet package of 25 Mbps. I would call every few days and they would ""reset the connection"", only for it to work for a few hours then stop again. They had no open appointments for almost 2 weeks for a tech to come out.When he finally did, he spent an hour working on our modem but only changed out a cord. I ran an Internet speed test through both the Comcast and Geek Squad sites (which took forever to load) before he left and both told me the Internet speed was about 5 Mbps. I asked the tech to check out the modem again and he finally got it to 12 Mbps but only when the Ethernet cord was plugged in. He told me, verbatim, ""You aren't ever guaranteed wifi, only Internet when you have the Ethernet cord plugged in."" REALLY?My roommate has a MacBook air which doesn't even have an Ethernet outlet. He basically said that was the best he could do and left. The Internet worked for about 2 days and then stopped again. I called back only to be on the phone for an hour and a half, transferred 7 times (because no one could figure out what was wrong), and then was told, ""The Internet appears to be working properly from our end but we could send a tech out for $70 to take a look at it"". I continually asked to be transferred to a rep in the US because I couldn't understand what they were saying and kept trying to get me to upgrade to an Internet bundle with home phone service. Who even has a home phone anymore? I was only connected to a U.S. rep when I told them I wanted to cancel my service, which I did. I also was told I wouldn't pay for the Internet for the time it was out which they had documented due to my numerous calls, but guess what? My bill doesn't reflect any type of price adjustment. I will NEVER use this excuse for a company again and would rather flush my money down the toilet than pay for their non-working crap. It's a shame they can get away with treating customers the way they do."
"James of Savannah, GA",3/9/2015,,"Every month I have to take an entire afternoon on hold and being transferred between Comcast customer service and Xfinity home security. Both have the worst customer service ever. Call about overcharges...they promise to correct and next month's bill arrives and...bam...still all jacked up. Been lied to so much by the every month. This has been going on for several months. Charged twice for home security, which doesn't work half the time. Can't wait to dump them for go with a Dish network or DirecTV."
"Ajay of Moraga, CA",3/9/2015,,"Comcast Xfinity - They unethically mis-sell me their Voice service saying that it will cover the international calling as well. When I receive my bill I was charged 200 USD more...charged for the calls I made along with few more hidden charges. When I called their CS agent, they accepted the mistake at their end but didn't reverted the unfair charges. I told them how cheated I am feeling at that time, but they didn't bother. I have never seen such a pathetic Customer service from any company. They have robbed my money, accepted it and decided not to give it back. If I'll not make the payment they'll submit the case the collection which will impact my Credit score. I am just wondering why nothing can be done against these thugs and why government has created such agencies one way. The consumer should also have easy and cheap access to file their complaints against such companies which can their businesses. That will enforce them to behave appropriately."
"Dominique of None, GA",3/9/2015,,"My bill fluctuates by more than $100 a month. Even though I have a package, the services are spotty at best, and there is no such thing as customer service. The department are so disjointed that it takes multiple phone calls to solve routine issues. If you have any other network provider as an option, you should definitely choose them."
"Geneva of Chicago, IL",3/9/2015,,"Last week a young lady who said her name was ** (she refused to leave her last name or give us a business card) came soliciting for our phone business. After we politely told her we were already good she aggressively kept at it. We had a lot of work to do and she wouldn't leave even though we explained we were busy and were not at all interested. We have a ""No Soliciting"" sign on our door as well, so legally she should not have come here. She then called us rude and said she would have bought something from us (we hear that one a lot). Great way to win over a new client. Show up uninvited and insult the potential client. If I could give Comcast zero stars, I surely would."
"John of Chicago, IL",3/9/2015,,"We are now going on our 3rd cable box in less than 12 months. And of course, our service tech is not here when he's scheduled to be. We were given a window of 5-7pm. Even received an automated phone asking if we'd be here during the scheduled time. It's now 7:30pm. No follow up call, no service tech. Unreal."
"Jamie of Modesto, CA",3/10/2015,,"For the last 6 months the internet is constantly going down and when you call customer service you are on hold forever and all they do is tell you, ""Yes an outage has been reported"" and claim to credit your account but have nothing about the constant outages! If I ran my business like this I would be shut down! Where is the accountability? This company is horrible. They always tell you ""Oh the outage should be resolved in 2 to 4 hours or more!"" Then you get a call or text saying it's resolved and you try your internet and it is still down??? One time the customers service guy told me it's because a lot of people in my area are streaming and it slows the internet down??? What the heck how can this be ok?? I would never recommend Comcast. They are just as bad if not worse than AT&T......."
"Steve of Collegeville, PA",3/10/2015,,"Having been a Comcast customer for over 15 years, they finally went over the top. After changing my service provider to Verizon in October, Comcast is now suing us for over $600 for past due fees. On October 4 we contacted Comcast customer service to advise them we are terminating our service and going to Verizon. We then drove the Comcast CS center, returned and cataloged all of our equipment, advising them we discontinued our service. We kept receipts and names of people we dealt with along the way. On or about December 1, we received a bill for over $400 advising us we are past due, and need to pay our bill otherwise services will be discontinued (they already have all equipment as of October 4). We contacted Customer Service via phone and advised them of the above, and they told us ""Ok, we never got the termination notice"" that they will remove our services immediately. Guess what happened in January 2015..... another bill for now over $500 advising us of the same, they will discontinue service unless we pay the past due amount. Another call, another ""I am so sorry,"" and another false promise to take care of the situation. Now it is February and guess what.... you got it another bill for now over $600 and the story goes on. So we now sent a letter explaining everything to Comcast as stated above, and thought the nightmare was finally over. Finally in early March we received an ""official Notice"" from a Collection Agency, advising to pay or....! We recently sent a letter with all of the backup bills, checks, and letter that we originally sent to Comcast. Can't wait to see what happens next.... Stay Tuned!"
"David of Canton, GA",3/10/2015,,My email was held for 2 weeks. This happened 2 times - it was horrible. They offer nothing for what we went through. They actually are allowed to hang up on us. I hate them.
"zhuang of Flintstone, GA",3/11/2015,,"I upgraded to Blast earlier last year and paid $10 extra for the upgrade, and also got the free upgrade to 105 when Comcast increased the speed last year. Since beginning of this year, I have to pay $12 for the upgrade instead of $10, and the speed is coming down to 50 mbps, back to before, and they didn't notify me before they asked more. When I called today, they said basically like this, ""yes, it's just been changed like this, that's how it is now."" What a greedy unfair business?!"
"Anette of West Valley, UT",3/11/2015,,"On February 9, 2015, My husband received a call from the billing department and the girl stated that our service would be stopped that day because of non-payment. She said they spoke with someone at the home the previous week, and advised them of such. My husband stated that could not have happened as we were out of town. She said they could speak with anyone about our account. He told them he would get with me and we would call back. I called back and spoke with another rep and advised them I had sent 400.00 and it should show on the account. She stated it didn't and again explained that they could call and speak with a 4-year old about the account and I needed to pay $559.15 that minute or service would be cancelled. We care for 3 disabled vets in our home and could not let that happen, so I paid the additional. Please pull the recording and verify conversation. Since then we have spoken with many people and it has resulted in our phone shut off, the ETF not waived as stated they would at the local office and online. Please help me resolve this snowball!!!!"
"A of Champlin, MN",3/11/2015,,"I was pretty happy with Comcast up until today. I went to pay my bill and discovered a charge of over 50$ for a wrestling show I did NOT order or watch. I was then told that they could see the times in which I viewed it, and that I watched the whole thing, but could not tell me from which box it was watched. Big rip off, if looking for customer service try elsewhere."
"Frank of Bonita Springs, FL",3/12/2015,,"Called last week to complain about slow Internet (downloads about 1-2Mbs according to Bandwidthplace.com. After IDing myself to their IVR system, I repeated the info to a rep, Told about my problem. Asked all kinds of questions about the modem and router. Said that it was their equipment so they should know all about it. She couldn't help so transferred me to their ""Advanced"" support. Repeated all the ID info and then was asked about the problem. Said that they would try to fix and call back in two days.Obviously, no help so I called back and they scheduled a tech to come on Sat PM. He arrived on time and checked signal strength and said the problem is in their system. Service drop is old and loss is above their standard. He would write a work order to run new service drop and increase signal strength. As you might expect, no improvement so I repeated everything early this PM and will see their service tech on Sat PM. By almost any standard Comcast is the absolute worst company in America. I just wish that the money being spent in DC to get the merger through was spent on improving infrastructure. We can only hope... "
"Brenda of Rehoboth, DE",3/12/2015,,"Comcast is a rip off. I just had it out with them for the last time. Returned my boxes yesterday and now have the lowest cable/internet package for existing customers (which is horrible for the price I pay). They were charging me an HD fee 9.95 on top of the box rentals (ridiculous). I have been in touch with the both satellite companies in my area and will be switching in 2 weeks. Even after the promotion package the satellite companies are still 43% cheaper than comcast... No hd fee ever!! No extra box fee ever!!! Three times as many channels as comcast and this is the lowest package... And yes this is all in writing, so it is legit/I do my homework.I have now by forewarned families by word of mouth in my neighborhood and hope to have a Comcast free community by the end of the summer. This is sad because I was a loyal customer for 14 years and the first few years were great. It is sad that comcast has to have such high increases and others do not. When I seen I was getting charged an HD fee on top of a box rental, that was the last straw. Sorry comcast onto cheaper and better TV. Oh everyone check your maintenance fee that went up too."
"Cheryl of Fair Haven, MI",3/12/2015,,"I went into a Comcast office with the plan to either get my monthly bill lowered (due to financial reasons) or turn in my cable box for cable tv yet keep my internet account with them. She couldn't get me under $60.00 per month and said the best she could do was $70.00 per month which I agreed to. This gives me basic tv channels plus internet. As I got on my Comcast account via the internet I realized that I was just locked into a 2-yr agreement and did not even know it. This lady never said anything about a 2-yr agreement with this change and I never signed any paperwork for it. I have been with Comcast without a contract for at least 4 years now. Is this legal? I didn't speak to her on the phone or through Comcast chat, I was face to face in their local office."
"John of Boston, MA",3/12/2015,,"I contacted Comcast to set up cable and internet at our new apartment. I spoke with a representative and agreed to a deal where we would get cable, internet, and a DVR for around 100/month. Pretty good. A technician came 4 days later and hooked everything up. The internet worked fine but the cable box was buggy. The next day, I unplugged it and rebooted it which worked for a day and then nothing. On the next evening, I called back and after about 30 min on the phone, the rep said that a technician needed to come and fix it. This was on a Friday and a tech wasn't available until Monday. Monday: tech comes and says a cable was loose and that the box should be fine (I was suspicious, but I let it go). The box was fine... for an hour. When I got home from work, the box is completely frozen and won't change channels or anything. Also, that Monday, I received a bill for $260! I call Comcast, and tech support tries to tell me that I'm using the remote incorrectly. I'm not, I know how to work the remote, I promise you. So needless to say, I'm getting upset. So I tell them that I no longer want their cable service and just want the internet that was advertised at $40/month. They tell me that offer is available to new customers only, and since I am an existing customer, I would have to pay $80/month for the service. Seriously!? That was it, I cancel everything. Unfortunately, there are no real alternatives in my area. Comcast needs more competition. They have so much control that they can easily get away with hidden charges and fees and extremely poor customer service because only they can provide broadband service to a public increasingly reliant on such a service. It's time that we demand an alternative to this corrupted company."
"Christine of Knoxville, TN",3/12/2015,,"This issue started almost a month ago. I was going to have some services disconnected. I have home security with them so I had to go to that department. The lady I spoke to gave me a great deal. I went to pay my bill and it was 455. So I called and found out she really put it in at everyday pricing. The man I spoke to said he would have to get it over to a supervisor to listen to the call and have someone get back to me. Well as you can imagine that hasn't happened. I have now been on the phone being transferred all around the world and back, hung up on 3 times and on hold for an hour total. If they don't have this taken care of by the 13th it will go into past due and then shut off. They have been allowed to buy everything they want and to hell with the customers. What happened to no monopoly?"
"Kristy of Nokesville, VA",3/13/2015,,"My family and I had signed a 2 yr contract. Two months after contract expired, bill stayed the same. March service cancelled due to non payment of the new amount. Payment went from 170 to 240 back in Dec. Never told of the change. I paid Feb bill. But they said the $240 was past due from back in Dec. I was told they did not have to tell of the change in price after the two year contract was up. I asked since they have no signed contract how can I be liable? Their response was. ""Maybe we should notify customers but we don't."" So I'm stuck paying it. I will never have Comcast again and I try to warn others as well."
"Kapil of Sunnyvale, CA",3/13/2015,,"I have closed my account in 2012. With the security deposit and additional payments I made, I am expecting refund of about account number - 116.98$. They have agreed on my refund but have never send it. I have called them multiple times, visited their office physically. All efforts in vain. I want my money back. Thanks!"
"Maddison of Bellingham, WA",3/14/2015,,"Today we received the bill (even though the website states it's for uses between March 17th thru April, so that doesn't make sense?) and they charged us for a new modem. No, we did not get a new modem, so we called and demanded why we got charged 300% of our normal bill for something that never happened. Long story short, it was a communication error on their end, and we DID NOT get our refund because the person who came out here wrote down that the problem with the internet was OUR fault because we had the wrong router. No, we don't have the wrong router. When we moved in we bought a router specifically for Comcast because they have a list on the website of which ones will work. So they lied? Comcast is 0% customer service and 80% trying to swindle money and scam you. The other 20% is non-American heavily accented Indian people who you can't even understand won't let you talk. So obviously we are completely done here. Either way, all of us are never going with Comcast again. We called CenturyLink and they are coming out first thing Monday. Thanks for absolutely living up to your name as the worst company in America. I have a dated journal of the three strikes your out screw ups Comcast did, and this is a summarized 3rd."
"Dee of Woodbridge, VA",3/14/2015,,"My X1 box stopped working so I take it to the Comcast Office to exchange. Waited 1 hour for assistance. I got the box home and it would not activate. Was on phone with Comcast for an hour and they could not fix. Scheduled for a Tech to come on Sun 7 March. NEVER showed. I called to find out they reschedule without telling for the next Sat, 14 Mar. Had a guaranteed appt btw 9:30-11:30. They called to confirm Fri & Sat. 1130 arrived and NO tech. I called and my appt moved to 1:00-5:00. They said Tech called me to say he was late. That was a lie. Tech finally showed at 1:20 and was clueless. Did NOT fix the problem. Said someone will contact me. Not going to hold my breath."
"Jesse of Bellingham, WA",3/14/2015,,Every single day I have to reboot or restart my modem. The on-demand works approx. 25% of the time. I am a traveling nurse so I have experienced many companies and this service is THE WORST! I can't even explain how disappointed I am. I absolutely HATE Comcast. Every time I call they always tell me to unplug and plug back in. Horrible. Never choose them if you have a choice.
"Wanos of Portland, OR",3/15/2015,,"I worked for Comcast for a few years as a billing rep. There are a few customers who often call in to cheat the system, with things such as ""I didn't order that PPV"" etc. However, there are legit customer complaints. We in the billing department did our best to listen to their concerns and help them out. My boss at the time, ** (out of the Beaverton, Oregon office), said his sister called into Comcast to get service. They promised her free install charges, but when she received the bill, she was charged installation fees. All the stories we heard about shady sales reps was quite true. He was upset. I'm not sure what happened after that though. When I had quit Comcast for a different employer, I was helping my fiancÃ©e (poor college student) with her Comcast bills. We called to downgrade and were transferred a few times, and finally to their retention department. The retention rep promised they would lower the bill by about $25. The next bill that arrived did not reflect that. We called again and spoke with 2 people, one of whom used to be a coworker I knew in the Advocates department. They claimed there was absolutely no records of the call we made. We canceled the Comcast service in response. Not too long ago, I hear of Comcast's partnership with UPS. I drop off my model as the rules stated. I'm still being charged $12 a month for a modem fee half a year later. A few calls to them and we get nowhere, even when they have record that I switched out my own modem!!! Needless to say, an unrelated issue arose where I now have to file for bankruptcy so I stopped paying for Comcast (since I'm down to $150 in the bank anyways). I am surely going to include that evil company in my debt discharge list because that is the only way to fight their cheating unreturned equipment charge. I am currently using Internet from my phone and just using Netflix. I am unwavering and completely against supporting this malicious company financially in any way, shape or form. Accordingly, I will never, ever, purchase any products from them again or recommend them as a company to anyone at all, completely out of principle."
"cj of Eaton Rapids, MI",3/15/2015,,Just to let people know how Comcast is. I sign up but cancel. Wasn't happy with service.. So now they want to refund 100.51 out of 300.00. Plus I had them cut cable off on 10 when I told them 12.. Plus I have asked 4 boxes. We don't send boxes out.. Better yet look at Better Business Bureau on Comcast. 15000 complaints & only 1500 has been resolved.. Go to DirecTV.. I had them for six years & never no problems.
"Bill of Sebastopol, CA",3/15/2015,,"STILL not using any TV provider. :) and very happy with that.Original ReviewPersonally, I think TV needs to be free. Why? It's a way for Corporations to advertise. Comcast gets paid by advertisers, why charge us as well? I don't want to PAY to be brainwashed. :) Between that and the poor news coverage on network TV, I've been phasing TV out. News & weather is available for free on the Internet, and on most any Smartphone. Movies and even TV shows are also available online, various options and prices, often free. So, I just canceled ALL TV, Their policies & TV services have been changing to the worst. They may think they are being clever by cutting back and raising costs, but this is my response!"
"Joanell of Atlanta, GA",3/16/2015,,"I recently purchased Comcast in August of 2014. On March 11, 2014 my Comcast went down. After an hour of troubleshooting they explained that a technician would have to come to my house the following Wednesday. I told them that was unacceptable that I needed a security system. Comcast repeatedly lied about having someone come out sooner and after several days of I trying to cancel the service they told me although the error was Comcast fault I still would have to pay an early termination fee and still have to wait until a technician to come to my home. I have been hung up on twice, not able to get a direct number for the home security department since that is not option on the phone, lied by a customer service agent telling me that the phone doesn't work and putting in escalation tickets that aren't true."
"Shannon of Bath, ME",3/16/2015,,"I recently paid my cable bill. A few days later, my new bill comes and it's about $15 more than it had been. When I called to ask why, they said my bill had been changed, my discount had been cut. I was not notified, nor did they give me a chance to negotiate. I called a different company to see what they could offer, and called Comcast back with more questions. I don't want to switch, it's more of a hassle, but after my experience with **, I'm more convinced that Comcast does not want to keep customers. I asked why the new members got an even better deal than I had originally, $10 less per month. She had no answer for me. When I asked if they could keep my rate closer to what I had originally, she said no, they couldn't. When I asked what they could do if I dropped tv, and just had internet they didn't even go through any offers, just quoted me 5$ less than what I will be paying. I asked her why they would rather get new customers than retain old ones, she stated they could not give any discount. I'm very upset with this company, and can't recommend them to anyone because they raise their rates without actually telling you OR offering you a different package. They could care less about existing clients."
"Katherine of Grand Rapids, MI",3/17/2015,,"I had internet through Comcast and was fairly happy with it. However my roommate was interested in trying out TV through them as well. In February, we upgraded our service and ordered the self-install kit. It took almost 2 weeks to get to our residence, they did not even ship it until exactly 7 days after the initial order date. When we received the equipment, the HDMI ports were literally covered up with a sticker and service reps on the phone refused to believe that this could be possible. Finally, they sent out a technician who saw our boxes, was baffled, and explained they must have been faulty. He was very nice and got us new equipment from his truck. The TV was finally working however we were unhappy with the service. Assuming (apparently wrongly) that I was still covered under the money-back guarantee, I call Comcast to downgrade my service back to the internet and after we finally get it worked out. The service rep. says ""oh by the way, you're not covered"" because the change was made to the account 31 days ago. Here's my problem, not only are we being charged for the shipment of the faulty boxes ($9.95), they are also charging us for the technician visit ($39.95) which was only necessary because they sent us faulty equipment! Now, I find out that even though our service didn't get set up until 14 days ago, we have to cover the entirety of what is now a $168 bill."
"LaWanda of Augusta, GA",3/17/2015,,"From day one I've always encountered problems with Comcast. First of all, none of my bills are ever the same month to month. Each month the bill seems to creep a little higher (AND NOT ONE EMPLOYEE CAN TELL ME WHY). Second the employees of Comcast are evidently not knowledgeable of the policies and protocols because each and every time I get a totally different explanation as to why my bill rises. Thirdly, the lines when paying the bill is unbelievable. A recent experience being I was told by one employee in the office that I had until the 28th to make a payment and holy cow I get home on the 15th and service was terminated. I never received any type of notice of any kind, just simply put, service was suspended. I really hate this place and will definitely seek other alternatives in my area. Another thing is the wait times for any type of customer service via phone is unreal. I held on approximately 45 min only to be hung up on. This place charges so much and the service is HORRIBLE. Another example, I went into the office to pay bill and was asked by employee about the xfinity home security system. The employee went over all details, gave me the total of what my bill would be each month and guess what. I get a call from the installation guy a couple of days before the system was to be installed. He says that he is calling to go over what my bill will be each month. Well guess what, he quoted me a $200 bill higher than what was explained to me in the office. Totally disgusted!!! I politely just cancelled the entire service call. PLEASE OTHER CABLE PROVIDERS HURRY TO AN AREA NEAR ME. TOTALLY DISGUSTED WITH COMCAST. THIS HAS WENT ON LONG ENOUGH. CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE. ASAP."
"Bryan of Jupiter, FL",3/18/2015,,"We just signed up for Xfinity high speed internet. We have had service for grand total of one week and we have had our second problem with internet issues and have had to call twice already. Today, we have no cable service on TV and no internet because connected to same splitter. Tech will be out on Friday at 1â€¦ Itâ€™s Wednesday!!! Two days without internet OR TV... We have been a customer for 10+ yrs and have had repeated TV issues. This is just the latest. We have been on hold for 30+ minutes on phone twice now. Really is a joke. Transferred to billing and back to another geography and back and forth."
"J. E. of Kentwood, MI",3/18/2015,,"Comcast implemented a price increase on our internet package. When we called, they offered a higher internet speed and cable package for lower than the original price. When we got the next bill the original price was doubled. Now we're going around in circles, being transferred to multiple people with absolutely no help or answers."
"tricia of Woodstock, GA",3/18/2015,,"Been dealing with this for over 3.5 months, have logged over 180 hours within that time to Comcast and no help or resolutions as of yet... 3.5 months ago receive bill from Comcast that is $550 over normal due to ""data overages"". Yes there are caps of 250 gb monthly but this constitutes over 127,000 GB being used by a single person with one computer, one tv and one cell phone (at&t). I have never streamed a movie, nor play games, never uploaded music etc., immediately call and inquire. Billing points out that three courtesy credits given already and why wasnâ€™t I aware?? Because the ""robo"" notification I am supposed to receive is not going to my correct phone #, although billing attest they have the correct #. CS is standing by the fact that the robo calls went to a cell phone no longer owned by me for over 2 years. So I call troubleshooting who is of no help. No sending out a tech to see if router is good, no walking me thru seeing how many devices are on my router, no comparison of monthly usage whereas normally I use less than 50gb in a month. Am told they are working on a ticket which a month later their solution was to correct my phone #. The tech that originally installed the new equipment happened to be my neighbor, since fired from Comcast and moved out 2 mos ago, but his buddies who still live there told me he often left a small door open in security and accessing neighbor's wifi... while he only installed mine on block. He was often ""troubleshooting"" neighbors equipment on off time. I got directed to them after finding out that when turning off all my devices and getting into router, there were 9 devices still listed. So I report this to Comcast, who does nothing.... no tech sent out, no discussions with CS and doesn't even get annotated in a file till January. Once finding out wifi is being used by others, immediately took actions to correct and no problems since but once again with no tech support and have spent the last 3.5 months with tickets opened that go nowhere, another 200 in connection/dis fees, and at least 2-4 hours every fifth day to get reconnected while these supposed tickets are under review. CS has even informed twice that everyone's first data overage credit is never shown on any bill, and one of my points was that regardless of who used data, my third credit should have been the 550. So how would any customer actually know how many times they exceeded data limit as the first credit is not annotated anywhere? So as a last ditch effort try the online help... Spent another 3 hours three nights ago, yet another escalated ticket opened with guarantees to be contacted within 48 hours. 48 hours go by, get back online requesting status of ticket only to be told ""something"" was sent to my personal email address and guess what, they send it to my email with all caps and I never get it. So another escalation ticket gets opened up tonight and services have been off for 5 days and counting.. So Comcast list of issues, notifications never received, no help or support identifying problem and or correcting, billing hours involving ""third"" courtesy credit, sending out questionable tech for installations and for all this joy they want almost 900 dollars in overages/disconnects and I have had no service for 5 days"
"michael of Montz, LA",3/18/2015,,"Well I order cable and internet thru Comcast first time customer. A rep said ""yes we service in your area and set a appointment up."" The tech came out looked around and said we don't service in your area. So I asked him why they did not tell me that they took a $200 deposit when my credit is very good. Did not know why needed a deposit they said it was for the equipment. I told him that he said well they should of never took a deposit. They put it on the bill so now I am mad so he left. I called the 1-800 number talked to a lady who made me talk to 5 other people. Finally got a manager on the phone. Told her everything and she said ""We will send you a check. It will take 6 to 8 weeks."" So it took 30 seconds to take me money but it will take 8 weeks to get it back in a week. I know we are in 2015 and I don't ever use checks and why can't you just put it back on my card so the lady put me on hold and came back and said ""OK I put it thru. It will be back on your card in 3 days."" Well a week goes by nothing so I called back went thru 6 different people again and on the phone for 3 hours and a man comes on and says nothing has been sent thru. It is pending. So I asked to talk to someone else a lady came on she said ""Nothing is pending. It has never been set up and they only send checks out."" So if I have to wait do I get late fees sent to me as well? I know if I was late on a bill I would have late fees. Now they should give me something for all this bull crap. No nothing.. 6 weeks later nothing yet. STAY AWAY FROM COMCAST AT ALL COST!!!"
"John of None, KS",3/19/2015,,"I have called Comcast on July 05, 2013 coz my internet and phone have been going up and down on a daily basis. The story is that I called them but I surprised that the customer rep she was not able to speak English! Then I asked her to transfer my call to another rep, she laughed and kept my call on hold 5 minutes. Another rep his name ** asked me what the problem is, he was very rude. After I explained my issue he said, ""Nothing we can do right now!"" Later on he kept me on hold and transferred my call to another rep. Again I said the same thing and said they will send a tech the next day. On the next day nobody came so I called again but the rep said that it can be fixed from the system!! After that I asked him to talk to the supervisor but he kept me on hold so I hanged. Later on I sent a mail to the same mail that was sent to me when I made my contract but no reply. It is really bad experience with this company! WHY THEY ARE DOING LIKE THAT??"
"Sandra of Philadelphia, PA",3/19/2015,,"I talked to a representative Feb 11th and asked her for Double Play (internet and TV). The rep started to tell me that they had great promotions. I told her my pay limits were up to $120 a month. She started saying that she was doing something special for me and that there was a plan with home security, telephone, internet and TV package and all in the price I was looking for; plus she said that she will waive installation fees, send me a $200 gist card and it was not a contract. At that point I said, ""Wow what a great deal.""The 19th of February the guys came in and installed the services and I they asked me to sign a contract, also my bill went from $119 to $185, then from $185 to $354 in just the first 2 weeks. That day my nightmare began. I called every single day since the 19th of February, people from customer services, customer solutions, billing all hung up on me and they did not care about anything at all. It was the worst experience ever. I tried, in every single call, explaining I got services I did not ask for and to listen to the call which has every single piece of the promises made by that sales rep that day (I gave them name, number, time of the call, length of the call). I had promises of managers and/or supervisors calling back and nothing ever happened. When day I called 10 times and the ten times I was hung up on. I never imagined Comcast was going to be so horrible. I returned all the equipment, no one cared."
"David of Winter Park, FL",3/19/2015,,"Comcast is an absolute JOKE!!! What a sorry excuse for an organization. No wonder they rate 1 Star. I am sure they would rate 0 if the system allowed. I am a 49 year professional businessman who has NEVER lodged a formal complaint in his life (in sum, I am not difficult to please). It took the complete Clowns at Comcast to break the ice. Kudos to them. I informed Comcast that I would be relocating to Florida and needed to settle up. I took my equipment to them and asked to square up with my final bill. The rep informed me he could not calculate final bill and Comcast would be in touch w/in 2 weeks. They never called. I made incumbent upon myself to contact them (twice). Again, I was told they did not have my bill ready and they would contact me via my cell phone. They never called. Instead these complete idiots, Unbeknownst to me, turned me over to a collection agency for a bill that I tried to pay 3 times. I obviously paid it on the spot including the $9 collection fee. This, after months of having my bill arbitrarily hiked without reasonable explanation. Avoid Comcast!! There are much better options."
"Phyllis of North Port, FL",3/19/2015,,"We signed up 2/27/15 under the 30-day money back guarantee. Canceled 3/4/15 because the recordings & on demand were not what they told us they would be. We were not allowed to have confirmation of this cancellation. Reps kept telling us it could come via email after some action or another........ didn't come. We were told some other action would generate the email confirmation....... didn't come. We got a letter saying the confirmation couldn't be sent by email. That letter was not a confirmation. They we owe $78; it is overdue. Now they are saying our equipment wasn't returned. We were told to take it to USPS. Before we did that, they called to say they could pick it up. We have that receipt with a 2-letter illegible signature & serial numbers that don't match the email that the equipment wasn't returned (so you might want to check everything on every document Comcast has you sign). I requested a supervisor 3/13/15; they won't transfer to supervisors. I was told one would call in 48 hours. Never happened. Nothing on our online account indicates we canceled services 3/4/15."
"Heidi of Lauderdale Lakes, FL",3/19/2015,,"I moved two months ago on a condominium that include basic cable on maintenance fees. I was told just go to the closest Comcast and show the association letter to active the cable. The first bill came on zero balance for cable service, and the second bill came with $20 charged for HD. It is supposed to be $10 for the first bill plus $10 for the second. I went to Comcast and I spoke with the representative that active my account about why I have been charged for HD service that I never ask for. He checked the computer and told me that he never add that service to my account. I went on, spoke on March 4th, and today March 18th and the balance is still on my account. That mean they charge whatever they want to the customers. My question is who did it? Why customer have to pay for Comcast mistake? I'm feeling ripped off, to be honest."
"Jen of Folcroft, PA",3/20/2015,,approved! Charged 150.00 to cancel service and cut my service on the 18th of the month even though I paid thru march 31! One of the worst companies to deal with!
"Denise of Salem, OR",3/20/2015,,"Comcast basically called my son a retard because he found out how to fix the geolocation and told Comcast how to do it and they refused. Our Geolocation says we live in Troy, Mich and we live in Salem, Or. I've been on hold for hours and days now and nothing is fixed. I want to speak to an American."
"teri of Springville, UT",3/20/2015,,"We disconnected our cable with Comcast because of the lousy packages they provide. In Canada the subscribers can pick the stations they wish to view but not here in the U.S. Because of this, we have intentionally been using ""rabbit"" ears just because we were so discouraged with our service and disconnected it. The stations we were receiving were so much ""infomercials"" and, not to mention, too many commercials, period.Still, my husband became tired of getting up and continually changing the ""ears."" He relented and decided to try the corporate t.v. again, much to my chagrin. As before, when he went to get a box for cable, it didn't work. He called customer service. Apparently, the poor guy in India he was connected to, didn't understand what he needed. So, the next day, my husband drove another 15 miles to get a new box. Surprise! That one didn't work either. In the meantime, our land line was cut off because we were informed that once the cable was re-installed, our phone would be cut off because of the package we chose. So now we haven't any cable AND NO PHONE.Bless the people that work for this company that make millions. They are only trying to make a living. Shame to the corporate shysters. May I ask you something, people that run Comcast? When did you lose your ethics and morality? When did you start believing you were better than the rest of us? Do you have Netflix? Or do you subscribe to your own? I am tired of being screwed around with. Comcast sucks. I know this is going out to the world but a person has a right to voice their opinion. And this is mine."
"Ritz of Malden, MA",3/22/2015,,"Is there ** minus stars??? I asked for a lower package, by taking off TV services, and to reduce the speed of the internet. What I found is that I am paying more (for the most expensive package of TV + phone services and internet!!! ) WT**!!! But I am only getting a slower speed service!! Those customer services/so called technicians gotta get it together! If you don't want to work, then don't! There is a reason why you are answering phone calls, first of all. It shouldn't be such a hard job, suck it up! Don't take your own problems on customers!"
"Patti of Port Charlotte, FL",3/22/2015,,"Started on install day. No show no call! When I called I was told I'd get a $20 credit and 6 Mon premium channel. Not! After they finally showed 2 days later I had the tech check all the wiring making sure it worked. Not! One main on didn't and that took 15 days before I finally got a competent tech. This was after 4 more no shows or no calls! He fixed everything the first one didn't. My WiFi is unsteady most the time and the guide channel just flips on, itâ€™s on 70% of the time. In less than 24 hrs to fix the quid it happened again as well during daily update it couldn't connect back. Waiting 15 min before I called. It took 1:05 min to get someone on the line. After the update was fixed, she transferred me to wireless. She actually hung up on me! I'm paying this huge amt and they can't live up to service! Anyone else have problems? Join me to force this monopoly to do as they promise! Love to hear from everyone!"
"J. S. of Boulder, CO",3/22/2015,,"I have been a faithful and paying customer of Comcast for 20 years. Recently I needed help lowering my bill as I was in school full time and a budget. Call 1 to customer service. New package deal offered, land line I never used and only had because of a bundle was removed to save money. Services like HBO, Starz, Streampix removed. Quoted $95.00 per month. Bill arrives, I'm still paying for all of these services I'm not receiving, bill higher by 20.00, than original bill I was trying to lower.Call 2. No record of call 1 existed in the system but they confirmed services were definitely disconnected. Offered a new package, stating a land line is mandatory and this was reconnected. New price 109 with contract. Still bare bones package I was supposed to receive before. When bill arrives, it is 10.00 higher than that last month.Call 3. No record of call 1 or 2 existed. But they confirmed I was paying for services I was not receiving. I was offered a package for 135.00 and a free X1 operating system upgrade. No charge. I had no reason to believe this was a real offer either. I was told I should pay my entire old bill and this new package would be retroactive a month because I'm paying for channels and services I'm not receiving.Self installation kit arrived: including a X1 box for extra rooms, to be used with the main X1 box. What main box? I tried it anyway. It connected to my network, said it was finding channels, and that the box had been deactivated. Back in the box it went, back to Comcast. Next bill: over 200.00. No retro credit, no new package deal. Just paying a huge price for ""services"". They got smart and stopped itemizing my bill.I made the 4th phone call crying to the customer service rep, telling her I'm broke, we have been doing this all year. I just need basic Internet and basic basic TV, local channels. I have 100.00 budget. She said they had nothing in my price range and suggested I disconnect their services. So that's it. They don't care about the longest, loyal customers. You aren't independently wealthy for a year? Bye."
"Janice of Mobile, AL",3/23/2015,,"I signed up 6 months ago for a TV-Internet bundle from Comcast for $80 a month for 2 years. When I first signed up, I asked the guy, ""Now, this is going to stay $80 a month for 2 years, right? No going up on the price or any surprise fees being tacked on?"" ""Oh, no, it'll stay $80 a month for 2 years, no surprises,"" I was told. Skip forward 6 months, my bill goes to $105. I call Comcast, what the heck? ""Well, your DVR fee was a special promotion that ended at 6 months, we're sorry no one told you that."" Am seriously considering cutting the cord, just going to internet. DirecTV was more expensive, but in 7 years, never had a problem with customer service or deceitful practices from them. Comcast Sucks!!"
"Michelle of Warsaw, IN",3/23/2015,,"Xfinity prices are out of control. I don't understand marketing for big companies.. If I charged 50% less than all the other customers but had 100% of all the customers I'm still making money and still in business, and have put the others out of business.. Xfinity sucks!!!"
"Kevin of Wheaton, IL",3/23/2015,,"To reduce this saga will be a challenge. So, moved, Comcast only game in town - signed up for Double Play. Received the wrong box, had to go to exchange at a service center. (1st one they sent me to had been closed for 2 mos.) Got that done. Called about the bill which was way more than agreed to. Agent suggested I add Phone and drop movie pkg. lowering my bill. Okay (Netflix). Received email - looking good, 2 & 1/2 weeks later no modem and lost my internet. 4 hours no joke, in calls and 4 different billing amounts ($103 to 298) all the while still no gear. Not sure what I'll owe. Asked for a supervisor, apparently he was helping the Pope and still is (Left my number but no call). And finally they dropped the movie service within 24 hrs. Guess they got that part right."
"Boris of Soquel, CA",3/23/2015,,"So I bellied up to the Premier Channels for 1 reason... get access to Channel 120 Nick Jr for my 4 year old daughter. It works in the Living Room, but I was just informed that I will be unable to access Channel 120 (Nick Jr) from our Kitchen due to the fact we have a ""Basic Box."" That seems to be a Comcast issue since I am paying for the ""Service"" and their hardware doesn't deliver that ""Service."" Do you think Comcast informed me of that limitation before upgrading to Premier Channels? (BIG NO.) I will let you guess where my daughter watches most of her TV... (if you guessed, Kitchen, you would be right.) Extremely disappointed. It feels like a ""bait and switch"" to me, and I am sure this is ""legal""???"
"Randy of Reno, NV",3/23/2015,,"Telephone support is worse than useless. My day is always ruined if I need to deal with Comcast customer. Once they said they were going to transfer me to ""Customer Loyalty"", I got a dial tone instead. Fitting for Comcast. Today I was just wanting to pay my final bill... it took two phone calls and a 30 minute chat. Come on Comcast, your phone tree is useless and your zero button is disabled. How bout some real quality customer service that isn't designed to just get your customers upset. I celebrated the day I could get rid of Comcast, now all I want is a final bill so I can be done with them for good."
"Magda of Cypress, TX",3/23/2015,,"My daughter had DirecTV and even with the basic package we were able to see tv with hd like quality. She moved to Comcast, they offered a package. The dvr were so expensive that me and kids got a small box quality? It looks like an 80's tv. Stinks."
"Morgan of Kent, WA",3/23/2015,,"About 2 years ago, I had service from Comcast. Out of 5 scheduled service appointments (guaranteed to be on time or $20 credit!) they gave me the credit 5 times. My favorite one was when I called to find out why they no-showed me I was told that they had shown, I didn't answer their call to confirm when they were on the way. I asked what number had they called? I had my cell with me all the time while I waited. She read the number and it was my Comcast internet phone number, so I asked her to read me the reason for service call and thought her voice amusing as she read ""internet phone not working.""Fast forward year later, (last year) and I sign up for service again. Told them I wanted same service as before - basic cable and internet (had downgraded to this last time due to poor service). Was told 89.99 was best they could do. Thought price must have gone up, not abnormal for poorly run, horrible cable companies. I go pick up equipment, pay initial deposit and return home. Set up equipment. Internet works, no TV, screen says ""channel not authorized."" After spending 2 hours being handed around and no TV still, they schedule service call and tell me I am lucky they have an appointment in 5 days available! Service tech shows early (awesome), looks at my screen and says ""filter on your line from previous tenant"" (I had moved since previous service). He goes downstairs and in seconds TV comes alive. He comes back, leaves receipt saying no charge for visit and bounces.I go to check my first bill and it is 331.00!!!! My plan, with taxes, was 127.00, they charged me 70 bucks for service call and another month. I finally, after 2 weeks, got them to remove service call fee, paid for one month and then asked them to give me basic package as I did not order it (I was 3 days over the 30 day guarantee). So they told me I would have to make bill current before they could change plan (wtf?) that they had erroneously given me. I had paid for first month because I had the service, but didn't pay second because I hadn't used it yet! They also had not changed the start of service date to my actual one as I had no TV for first week, that's why I had passed the 30 day mark. I explained I was on fixed income and second payment would not be possible for 30 days. They basically said ""Oh well."" Made next payment, called again, was told bill could be lowered to $54..... as soon as I caught it up. Tried managers, online chat, and I have never talked to such rude, mean people in my life..... that were supposed to be customer service agents!!! I thought I was in the twilight zone. So, I cancel service and return equipment. Told there was wait time for receipt. So, 2 weeks later, I get bill for 320 bucks for the equipment.... took me another 2 weeks to get that straightened out. I HATE COMCAST. I MEAN THAT. I REALLY HATE THIS COMPANY. DID I REMEMBER TO SAY THAT I HATE COMCAST?"
"roslyn of San Jose, CA",3/23/2015,,"I am a senior. We had construction done and my cables was disconnected due to construction. I called the technical dept. to help and the first agent (**) sounded like he just woke up and he was no help whatsoever. He had no respect for a 60s older woman. The second tech named ** took more time with me and problem was still not fixed. So he set up a date with me to have someone to come out. The tech person I had was ** was very polite, funny and very caring. I give ** the highest score that you have."
"Stephanie of Chaska, MN",3/24/2015,,"I ordered the triple play. They could not get the telephone to work so I cancelled within 30 days. I have called numerous times to get them to credit my account for the triple play charges. I also cancelled my auto pay. They took money out of my checking account anyway. When I called, they said I paid them. I looked over my checking just to be sure I did not. When I called back they said again that I paid from my account. I knew I did not. When I asked to speak with a supervisor, she refused saying I already had previously. I think they must get bonuses for not bugging the management. Still no idea why they took my money and no one will tell me."
"tara of Palm Beach, FL",3/24/2015,,"In a three week time frame unsuccessfully dealing with Comcast for my house (A) & (ironically) my boss's apt (B). ""A"" is new client & ""B"" existing client. A & B 3 visits each to date - no resolution. 6 techs give scripted reasons i.e. - the AV techs say ""there is a problem with wires being old - you need the old wire dept"". Old wire department comes - ""they didn't tell me B is a building - have to send a subcontractor."" ""I can only do private house wires."" Reading the 6 different order sheets I notice info is always wrong- ""phone agent"" problem. Down 25 hours of time & $240 in tips (6 techs so far). I can't punish all techs for following orders they have been given by ""phone agent"". Comcast hired ""White Fence"" (customer solutions) to call me after follow-up survey re: B. Their Supervisor is going to listen to all of the recorded (by Comcast) phone calls with ""phone agents"" to identify problem (prompts me to reschedule B). Next day WF calls & says I should reschedule B. That was the timely solution to an ""equipment agent"" not showing up? Does WF fee get passed on to customers? ""White Fence"" listening to past conversations did not instill confidence. Currently waiting again for Comcast (A & B) and for our TV repair man - Comcast ""special services"" agent mistakenly disengaged Crestron disabling channel changing & on/off functions. Only hope this post helps those as frustrated as I. What can we do? hashtag Comcast? After 3 Comcast visits and no result our TV repairman says he rebooted box and now our Comcast services are restored in B. Incredible!!"
"Larry of Bellevue, WA",3/24/2015,,"The quality of the internet service provided by this company was very poor, with frequent long periods of outages. I called to complain and they said they would send out a technician. The technician said there was nothing wrong with the equipment, even though he made a lot of adjustments to the modem and router, and further adjustments to a box located OUTSIDE the residence. He suggested that the best way to get the ""Wireless"" equipment to work would be to hard-wire it. REALLY. That's what he said. I'm not kidding. I was further shocked to get a seventy dollar charge for this so-called ""service."" When I called to complain about the charge, I was told that the charge was ""Legitimate"" and that Comcast would not remove it. What they will be removing is all of their substandard equipment as I am looking for a more dependable and customer friendly company to do business with. Comcast has ZERO skill in customer service. It is the worst I have ever encountered and I only rated it one star because I was not allowed to give it a zero. Stay away from this joke of a company at all costs!"
"T of Laplace, LA",3/25/2015,,"After 3 times of a Comcast tech tried to fix the issues with cable and Internet I switched. Trying to get an actual person off the phone took between 45 minutes to 2.5 hours. I finally had to drop off all the equipment off at their local branch. I also called my bank to pull the payment from Comcast. Of the 23 days I had their service, if you call it that, I had 3 days of actual cable TV and Internet."
"Julie of Baltimore, MD",3/25/2015,,"We had contacted Xfinity/Comcast to set up a thermostat that would allow us to remotely set the temperature of our home on 3/19/2015. They were supposed to come on 3/21/2015 to install the thermostat but never showed. On 3/23/2015, my husband contacted them again to set an appointment. The customer service representatives were unable to provide a reason for their missed appointment that Saturday. We set another appointment for 3/24/2015 between 1PM and 3PM. The technician did not show up until 6:30 PM. He started working on the thermostat but, when asked how much longer it would take (around 8PM), the technician said that he was almost done but that we wouldn't be able to get heat because ""the lines were backwards."" The technician was getting ready to leave our residence, knowing that we had no heat. My husband asked him to replace the original thermostat as it would be about 32 degrees and we have four children (two 8-year olds, one 6-year old, and a 6-month old). He worked on the original thermostat for about half an hour and then left our residence without notice. The heat was not connected to the thermostat and the thermostat was hanging off of the wall when he left. After multiple attempts to contact Xfinity/Comcast, we were unable to get another technician to our residence and it was unclear whether or not they would bill us for the ""service."" They also refused to provide a name or ID for the technician so we could file a formal complaint. My husband was on hold for almost an hour and a representative disconnected the call twice. We had to call an emergency service to fix our thermostat and hook it up to the heat which costed $75."
"Honglay of Mundelein , IL",3/26/2015,,"I just had a terrible with Comcast customers services. They don't even know know to handle and answer that customers needed. I was on the phone with a very rude guy, his name is **, who working at business department.

"Shawna of Indiana, PA",3/26/2015,,I made a postdated payment for the past due amount. I go to my bank and find out that took out 262.00 and i postdated for 200.00 so now i have over drafted. I called them to find out what is going on. They hung up on me and I called back and i have been on hold for 20 min and no one has picked up. So now I am having to pay the extra 62.00 plus 35.00 overdraft fee. So what can I do where I live we can not get dish or any satellite because of the trees behind us. So therefore comcast is our only option we have.
"Tom of Lowell, MI",3/27/2015,,"I was a relatively happy Comcast Business Internet customer for several years. I am a physician who is also an IT executive who works out of my home. We built a new house and discovered that Comcast did not offer service at the new location. When we attempted to disconnect the service they would not do anything without my account number. We were on e-billing and the account number was not included in the billing notice. All of our business paperwork was packed and in transit so not available. I spoke with at least 6 different CSRs over a two month period in which several things were promised but not followed up on; sending a paper bill (promised on 3 occasions) which would include the acct. number; a supervisor would call (on 4 occasions, only the last time did it occur); and I was to be transferred to a higher authority and call dropped 3 times. Finally in late January, a sympathetic CSR (many were not, some were concerned but didn't know what to do) took the time to directly contact a supervisor who could help with the disconnect and who finally sent me the documentation for a Voluntary Disconnect that included my account number (this process took approximately 45 minutes to accomplish, but a mere pittance compared to the approximately 5 hours I had spent to this point). I filled out the form immediately and returned it. Now, 2 months later I am still receiving bills for service that was no longer being used for 4 months. I was informed that it takes 60 days to perform a disconnect.I am willing to pay the 2 months of fees, starting in November, if that is what my contract calls for. However, I am not willing to pay for 4 months. In addition, my time is too valuable to have to spend this much time for ANY business related service. I have heard horrid reviews of poor service by Comcast but never in my life would I have anticipated that shutting off my internet would be this difficult, and expensive."
"rogelio of Montgomery, IL",3/27/2015,,"Well I call customer service 2 days ago asking why my internet is very slow. They said ""you have the basic."" I said ""OK but I'm customer. I'm not so happy what I can do."" The guy said ""I can give 2 pks for 54.99, include t.v and internet."" I said ""I don't need the t.v."" He said ""is the only way"". I said ""really"". I'm very disappointed why service is bad. But when I said no he said ""let transfer with others peoples"". I said OK but I was in the line 15 mins waiting. No one help me. After that somebody disconnected my call. Not good at all. I'm looking for different company."
"wanda of Abingdon, VA",3/27/2015,,"Hmm, let's see where to begin.... Their speeds are not accurate no matter where you live. I've had the misfortune of living in two areas where they own a monopoly and it was never the speed they sold you. You are INCREDIBLY lucky if you can get through to talk to someone without them or the automated system hanging up on you. My BIGGEST complaint is how they will pad the bill and not tell you. Just don't take the story I'm about to tell you. Read all the others posted here on this forum. Somehow when I upgraded my service last year & bought myself a new modem (from Best Buy) for the DOCSIS 3.0 upgrade, the billing team decided to put down I was renting the DARN thing.... I didn't notice till one year later and all I got was a sorry and $20 credit. If they didn't have a monopoly in my current region, I would definitely change in a flash."
"FRANK J of Hatfield , PA",3/27/2015,,"We switch from Verizon to Comcast on Mother's Day last year. Comcast contacted us to see if we were interested in changing providers. We agreed on a monthly price and equipment. Four months later, our bill was increased due to audit and they increased our monthly fee. They claimed we obtain an additional pc. of equipment unbeknownst to them and shut the device off from their end. When I inquired they turned it back on and then the billing nightmare began. Every month I call and try to speak to a floor manager. When I finally was able to speak with **, he provide me with a ref # and assured me a return call within a week. In addition, he also stated that he understood my problem and that the Comcast should honor my contract. Next month, no changes to my account & the bill began to grow. I have asked several time for them to pull my original phone recorded statements to listen to the statement of their representative telling us for a certain amount each month and for the equipment they installed, our monthly fee will not be increased for 1 year unless we order a movie in addition to package. We understood and agreed. Now I am being told they need to charge for the additional pc. of equipment and they had a rate change. I have dates and times in which our conversations occurred. But I am told, they cannot go back to listen due to volume of calls they receive (I am sorry to hear that, but every conversation starts off with a recorded message stated ""this call is recorded for training purposes""). Every month I called I tried to give the CSR the ref #, but it appears they have no meaning. Hopefully they can resolve this issue and honor what they originally promise. I feel this is a simple request. Thanks for listening!"
"Pamela of Strasburg, OH",3/27/2015,,"I connected in December with Comcast. In Feb. when I still had not received a bill, I called THEM! Since then I have spent hours on the phone and on email with various representatives who have taken my checking account numbers for auto pay, as well as my credit card for quick pay. Nothing has worked and I am nowhere near overdrawn on either. My credit card statement even shows where the money was taken out, but I still get phone calls and emails saying I now owe over $300. It is unbelievable. I have tried to contact the man who says he cares about my business in the emails, but no one seems to know who he is. I have no other option for cable or I would definitely take it. We love DirecTV but cannot get it in our condo due to regulations about dishes on roofs."
"c. of University Place, WA",3/27/2015,,"When moving my service to a different unit in my complex, they never told me about having a new account number, changing billing dates, and never told me that I had a choice to install my cables boxes myself. I was charge another install fee. When talking to customer service I was told that should of been told that i had to make new online account for moving my service. Well I wasnt told nothing. And they charge me crazy for not informing me about all my change they made on my account."
"Brandon of Spring, TX",3/28/2015,,"Comcast sent an employee out knocking door to door in our neighborhood shortly after we moved in. We were in the process of transferring our ATT service over from our previous address and after convincing us he could reduce our monthly cable bill by as much as 75%, we agreed to give them a 12 month trial. 12 months of pure hell is what was in store for us!! Weekly service interruptions, internet speed 10 times slower than advertised and bills that seem to increase monthly without any notification from these scumbags. After multiple complaints and phone calls and multiple attempts of having technicians out at our house to research repair issues with no real solution, a Comcast representative informed us over the phone that it was in our best interest to just increase our current service to get a faster internet. Knowing I was locked into a contact for another 6 months, I agreed that if I am stuck with these crooks for another 6 months, I'll pay a little more each month and gain the benefit of faster internet. Well, lo and behold, what I did not realize, was that by agreeing verbally over the phone to have our internet service boosted up to the fastest level, I was unknowingly committing to another 24 month contract. After never receiving any documentation or notification of this new contract, the 6 additional months of a joke of a cable service had finally came to an end. When we finally called to cancel, knowing our original 12 months of hell was over, it was brought to our attention that we have a remaining 18 months on our contact of being stuck with this garbage cable company full of low life's and liars. I immediately argued and asked for a copy of this so-called contact that we signed and was told that conveniently for them it is company policy they cannot send it to me. Not via mail and not via email. When I told them I didn't care and I still wanted to cancel they told me that to do so I am liable for a $250 early termination fee and if I did not pay it, that additional fees would apply and they would send to collections and damage my credit.Can we be held responsible for a contract we did NOT sign? A contact that as far as we understand, does NOT exist. A contract that the seller is refusing to publish or make available to the buyer. This is a scam! It's a pathetic scam and a shame. Even if we are under contract, is Comcast not in breach of this contract for failing to provide its clients with a proper duty of care? I'm sure the contract should read that the client agrees to pay for x, y and z service from the seller only if x, y and z are actually being provided to properly to the buyer right? The real crime is that x, y and z SUCK and Comcast SUCKS!!True Story: I once called Comcast to report an internet outage, they told me they needed to verify my account and needed either my account number or the exact dollar amount of my last payment. I responded no problem, then paused and stated that I could not provide either of those to them because Comcast setup us up with paperless billing and that in order to retrieve that information I would need access to my email which would require a working internet service. Comcast response: ""Well you will have to call your bank, find out the dollar amount of the last payment and call us back."" Are you kidding me??? This is how you do business???Another mind blower: Did you know that if you call Comcast to report a service interruption they will have a someone over the phone attempt to walk you through a step by step process of resetting the equipment installed in your home by Comcast. If after 2 hours of this fails and the end result is that Comcast has to send a technician out to your home to fix the issue (like actual ""work""), they bill you a service charge for their faulty equipment. But wait, you can avoid this service charge if you agree to pay them a monthly service charge protection fee. Hang on, so... you mean to tell me, that if I as the consumer who is simply renting your crappy equipment experiences a problem with your crappy equipment, you will invoice me to for your technician to come fix your own crappy equipment? And if I want to avoid that fee, I have to pay you basically an insurance premium for your crappy equipment? How the ** is that even legal? The fact that these crooks get away with this, is an absolute travesty. Can anybody please help?"
"sarah of Marathon, FL",3/28/2015,,"I totally understand outages happen, we had a small rainstorm last night (nothing big from what Florida can bring on), but we are now 18 hours and counting without internet and without an eta. Some of us have businesses to run or other obligations that rely on internet and being left without it for a full day, drastically impacts that especially in season. 18 hours seems excessive for any large scale company to solve a problem."
"denise of Pittsburgh, PA",3/28/2015,,"Paid overdue bill by phone and next day cable was shut off for nonpayment. After a half hour of being shuffled around to 3 different reps and being told everything from my name is not on that account (which I've had for over 25 years) to no info on bill being paid over the phone the day before she finally found the notes. All she kept saying was ""We apologize for that."" Also all the reps I spoke to are very hard to understand. Time to switch to Dish I think!"
"Mary of Burton, MI",3/28/2015,,"Called Comcast to check out a cheaper bundle package deal. I have been a Comcast customer for over 25 years and was told that I am paying the cheapest basic price. I have no premium channels, only have 2 HD TVs. My bill is over $200.00 monthly. I work with a client who has a Triple play package with all premium channels, security etc. (The Works). After paying a huge monthly bill she cancelled with Comcast and went to U-Verse. Comcast called her and said ""We value you and want you back. We can give you this wonderful Triple play pkg. deal for $150.00 a month."" After telling customer service I want the same plan they hung up on me, told me NO ONE pays under $200.00 (I have a copy of her bill to prove it). The rep then said, ""Well it was a promotion we were offering no longer available"" I told them they were not telling the truth etc. The Rep. said, ""I can offer you a basic package because you are not a new customer and the best I can do is give you Starz,"" which lowered my bill not by much $24. a month. Old Loyal customers are not valued and it doesn't pay to stay with a company like Comcast. They have made it very clear they DO NOT VALUE LOYAL Paying customer. It took 2 days and 5 phone calls to get a reduction in my bill and I still am NOT satisfied. So cancel Comcast get a new carrier and have them beg you back!!!! That is what I learned. This is poor customer service at its finest!!!"
"Karen of Lodi, CA",3/28/2015,,Comcast took $281.91 from my checking account without my authorization. Despite multiple phone calls they did not refund the money. The only way I got my money back was by going to my bank. They were able to stop payment to get my money.
"Robert of Hialeah, FL",3/29/2015,,We had a set appointment with Comcast yesterday. The tech never showed up and was hours on the phone with them and promises were made to send a tech. No tech ever came. I have since been on the phone again several times and no Tech. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. They lie to you in the phone and make a prisoner out of you to your home waiting for them.
"Keilani of Roseville, CA",3/29/2015,,"We being with Comcast for almost 8 yrs and happy in one time. Then they sweet talked us to change to Xfinity. From day one I have problem with my box on the TV room, 90 times I can't access to my on demand channel. However I called every time when problems occurred all they said â€œwe need to send a tech service man over to change the boxâ€. After changed our box 3 times I had to refuse to have another tech in my house. I told them they need to come up with a new excuse. After calling the whole week for the same problem with on Demand plus the color is fading out. I decided to make a complaint to a supervisor of course she is not available but will call me in 2 hour. Supervisor ** called me I explained to her my complaint no sign of care. However she offered to have a tech come to my house I told her â€œwhy I don't like tech in and out my house but I will take one more depending the time as my husband and I will be leaving out of down late afternoon for my husband birthday on Sunday.â€ ** the supervisor reply she will have someone be at my house between 10am and 12noon. I had confirmed and let her know that I will be gone right after make sure they will be on time. Today after 12:30 no Comcast no phone call. I gave them a call and spoke to an agent she said my appointment is between 2pm-4pm. I am fierce after spoken and told she set me to a late appointment."
"paul of Duluth, GA",3/30/2015,,"Comcast implemented data cap in my area, allocation of 300 GB for residential accounts. I was told by a rep, after reaching the data limit my account will be charge $10 for an addition 50Gb. This is outrageous. Unfortunately, they can force this on us because of a lack of competition."
"William of Vancouver, WA",3/30/2015,,I called Comcast to try to put off paying my bill until the middle of the month when I get paid again. What so hilarious is when the recording comes on it says I'm an xfinity insider... HA... HA... HA. They said that if it was not paid by the 14th of April that my services would be interrupted. That's just one of the reasons I switched from cable T.V. to Dish Network satellite service and told them that I have a cell phone I can use for my home phone and a NetZero Hotspot I can use for internet service and cancel all of Comcast's services!!! 
"nadia of Hillsborough, NJ",3/30/2015,,"They charge me 80 per month. Provide worse service. In Hillsborough, NJ they have monopoly so they are Gods. Taking huge amounts of money in providing worse service."
"Randall of Hobe Sound, FL",3/30/2015,,"I have used Comcast Internet for 3 years. I have never given a complaint of any kind. However, in the past two months, I have almost daily outages. I used Comcast's website to ask about the problem. They sent a person who told me that ""Your cable wiring is too old; I will send someone tomorrow to fix the problem."" When he arrived, he informed me that we must pay a ""custom installation fee."" I just paid Comcast to install our internet service 3 years ago - and now have to pay again?? Does Cable wiring really last only 3 years - or (as I suspect) did Comcast take a shortcut on the installation and now expects me to pay again for the same job."
"Celeste of North Garden, VA",3/31/2015,,"Consolidated my business utilities for convenience and less money (so I thought). Signed contract on 10-3-14. No service from them until 12-18-14. Rep said had a lot of problems with other customers. When reps came to switch service they were asking me where certain wires were and things that I didn't even know what they were talking about. This lasted for about a week of them sporadically coming and going. Then the nightmares really started. My credit card machine started to be very slow or not work at all. I called Comcast. Reps did not show up were scheduled, and then blamed my CC company and the CC card company blamed Comcast. This went on for months. Then the CC would not batch out at night so my sales were not credited. I spent so much time on the phone with Comcast one day I just broke down and cried to the woman on the other end of the phone. Ten days ago I lost all internet/WiFi connection. Called Comcast Thursday, March 19th, was told Rep would be there tomorrow, Friday 20 March. They called that day to confirm... no one showed up or called. Called them again and a rep finally showed up today, March 26th and ""fixed"" the problem, which was caused by ""a lot of problems"" with the ""boxes""!?!? Finally got a rep on 3-30 to ""fix"" the problems. I plan to go back to Centurylink as soon as possible. My contract says nothing about early termination fees, and even so I will tell them to take me to court. I doubt any court would award them anything with such abominable and shoddy business practices. The FCC should be made aware of all these complaints and either fine them or shut these shysters down!"
"Yolanda of Memphid, TN",3/31/2015,,"My services went out. Consumer service scheduled appts & no one came out. I missed work and couldn't submit assignments for my online masters program. I talked to 11 people and one supervisor told me there was nothing he could do and hung up the phone. When I called back for the third time they told me that I had an appt scheduled for the next day but they could not guarantee me the techs would show up. When I asked what I should do, I was told they are not sure. Most of the reps were nice, however the supervisors were very nonchalant. I was lied to and hung up on. I pay $155.05 per month for my service and every month since January my service has had issues and this is the second time an appt was scheduled and no one came out and when I called I was told it was never put in."
"Patti of Gallatin, TN",3/31/2015,,"My most recent bill came with an extra $100 due. After spending 80 minutes & talking to 3 different customer service reps, my bill was reduced by $90. During this time I discovered I had been paying for home security system, that I had for only 3 days, since November 2013! This was $30/month. They refuse to refund any $$ because it's too much! Worst customer service anywhere."
"robert of Eugene, OR",4/1/2015,,"I canceled Comcast business internet and phone due to illness and business being closed. Also due to their gross mismanagement of my account requiring me to call them several times each month to straighten it out. They would take the information, say it would be taken care of, and then nothing would be done. After several complaints they got rude and unresponsive, charged my credit card even after I had changed the card (3 times) - charged me for items without sending a bill. Refuse to cancel account even after I wrote them an e-mail to their consumer service stating I was canceling. They change the bills each month and say I owe them for an early termination fee. They broke the contract first. I owe them nothing."
"Jane of Brick, NJ",4/1/2015,,"Comcast has been overcharging me on my cable for the past 7 months since 9/14 until current. They have credited me back $289.71 which still leaves an outstanding balance of $586.71. I have made over 30 calls/chats, sat on hold for hours at a time. I have been given numerous names, id#, ticket numbers. I just called back to find out why my credit which should have been $586.71 was only $289.71, I gave them the most recent ticket number they stated that the ticket was closed and finalized and I owe them $389, outrageous. I need to speak with an Attorney."
"Kathy of Franin, TN",4/1/2015,,"Steady bill increase. Called to ask why? This conversation resulted in me negotiating a new rate and updating my equipment. Scheduled a tech for 10 days out. Somehow the appointment was cancelled by a tech BUT my new contracted service began charging me yesterday. They also turned off my DVR service. So now one hour and 32 minutes, 7 live people and one accidental hang up by a supervisor, I still have no answers. It's pass the buck at its finest. Total lack of concern for their customers. They hold a monopoly and treat customers as expendable. How are they so huge and have no accountability?"
"John of Denver, CO",4/1/2015,,"Beginning with my signing up for an account in August of 2014, I proceeded to pay for three months of HDTV, DVR, and several channels that never worked. After several attempts to resolve this with communications through both online chats and phone calls, my issue was finally resolved after they agreed to send out a tech to investigate my issue. Once the tech arrived, he proceeded to perform the same diagnostic checks that the original installer had done to no avail. Once completed, this tech eventually checked the connection on the back of my house and found an archaic filter attached to my connection cable. I had been billed, at this point, for 3 months of services I never received. After this semi-competent tech repaired the outdated lines on my home, all was fine for several months. After this issue was resolved, the billing nightmare began. My bills began to reflect payment dates that apparently had no bearing or connection to reality. I was told that my next bill was not due until the normal time of the following month, yet my service was cut off on 3/30/2015. I called in and paid the required ""past due balance,"" and my service was restored. I returned home from work on 3/31/2015 to my television and internet not working again. I called in and was told I was required to pay another $30.00 charge, and could not be told why. I could even expect to pay the superfluous ""reactivation fee"" that I was told I would have to pay on my next bill, but to have to pay two days in a row?Comcast operates under the same tactics as a classic monopoly, and answers to no one. The hoops they require an everyday consumer to pay just for the privilege of watching television is absurd, and I am still paying for their nonsensical package that includes a home phone, despite the fact that one under the age of 94 still uses a land-line."
"James of Pelham, NH",4/1/2015,,"I was going to cancel my Comcast bundled services, but Customer Service gave me a better deal -- they would upgrade my Xfinity Triple Play for a much better package, faster internet etc for Less money. They said my rate would not change for 2 years. Surprise, surprise -- when the first bill came, they charged me for an ""inactive modem"" for $7.00. The bill arrived more than 30 days after installation, so I could not CANCEL the contract. I called Comcast right away, and they told me I had to return the old modem. What modem? The installer took every old piece of Comcast equipment away with him when he left. I did not get any receipt, nor did he offer one to me. Next bill comes, and now they are charging me another $10.00 for their outdated piece of junk that they say I have. I called again, ""they are investigating the Ticket #,"" and it can take a while. Meanwhile, I will keep getting charged these monthly fees. I will call them weekly to follow up -- I am retired and living on a fixed income, and have plenty of time on my hands to get this straightened out. It's a shame the way they treat their long term customers, and I guess I am not the only one."
"S. of Memphis, TN",4/2/2015,,"I signed up for Comcast Security in December 2013, canceled in January 2014 within the 30 day period and my service was inactivated. Since then I have called to tell them that I am still being billed as recent as April 2, 2015 ($100+) a month for over 16 months. Confirmed today that my security services cannot be troubleshooted because they are inactive. Why have I paid over $1,600 for inactive service and continuing to pay because if I don't, all my other services will be disconnected as well and I need my internet so I have been forced to pay for the security service even though it has been inactive since January 2014 and confirmed again today with ** in Home Security Trouble Shooting Department that my security service is inactive but it remains on my bill. This service has been inactive since January 2014 as noted/recorded in several calls (over 75) made to Comcast through out 2014. I was also just told today that I do not qualify for the $100 gift card that was promised to me in January - April of 2014 for all of my inconveniences (after calling in threatening to cancel all services and switch over to AT&T) and being told as early as March 31, 2015 that I did qualify for it and it was in the mail. Comcast departments has purposely deceived me into paying for their services while knowing that I wanted to cancel the Xfinity Home Service over 16 months ago."
"Rhonda of Odum, GA",4/2/2015,,"I had no problem with Comcast (I'm a fairly new customer) until a couple of months ago, when I sent in a payment on my account. When the next month's bill came in, it showed this amount unpaid and past due. I double-checked my bank account to see what had happened with the payment. It HAD cleared my bank account. I called Comcast and was asked to fax a copy of the cancelled check to them, which I did. I was told it would be cleared up as soon as they received the check. A week later, I called just to follow up. The amount was still not cleared up and I was told by a different rep that this type of matter could take up to 2-3 weeks to resolve because Comcast had to wait for information from THEIR bank to find out where the funds were erroneously posted. I explained that I understood their problem, but that they're trying to internally track a mistake in posting shouldn't prevent them from crediting my account (To add insult to injury, my Comcast account number was written in the memo portion of the check.). The next day, I received a collections notice from on the account, and when I called to explain the situation, the ""collector"" insisted that I pay the disputed amount AGAIN and trust Comcast to credit it back to me when they got it straightened out, which I refused to do. I asked to speak to a supervisor, who told me he wouldn't even accept the reference number I offered so he could see for himself that the bill had, in fact, been paid. After that lovely phone experience, I called the Comcast business number AGAIN, asked to speak to a supervisor, was refused, and was told that all the customer service reps could do was document my calls, because the problem was being handled by ""accounts receivable"". I asked for a phone call to someone who was actually working on the problem and was told the customer service rep was not ""at liberty"" to give me that information. But he assured me that he was taking the late fees (which I did not owe in the first place) off my account to make up for my ""inconvenience"". To date the matter still isn't resolved. I would NEVER do business with Comcast business again, nor would I ever recommend them to anyone else. Oh, one other thing, just to REALLY add insult to injury, I get a junk mail come-on from Comcast business almost every day, urging me to sign up for the service I already have. This company needs SERIOUS help."
"G. N. of Portland, OR",4/3/2015,,"We have always been very pleased with Comcast tech support. But they must have decided to save some money, because today I had a terrible experience. I was calling for help with an app that wasn't working properly. I had to go through about 5 min. of robo call to get an agent. Eventually I had talked with 3 agents, none of whom were able to help. Despite giving my phone number at least 3 times, when I was cut off with the first agent (their mistake) she didn't call me back. So back to the robo call and 2 agents later, no help at all. They have outsourced and each of the 3 agents had a strong accent and talked very fast so it was hard to understand them. This is the first time I've thought about getting a different internet provider."
"Kevin of Jacksonville, FL",4/3/2015,,"I recently received my bill from Comcast. My normal monthly charges are $119 plus taxes, surcharges, fees. Total should be about $144 (verified via emails from Comcast). This bill is $287!! I reviewed the bill and learned that $68 of it was a balance from my last account (I recently moved). I had no problem with that amount, but $68 + $144 DOES NOT EQUAL $287. I also noticed double charges on the bill. I called Comcast, emailed Comcast (20+ times), and am now emailing Comcast Corporate... all with no resolution. I have received an email from 1 of their employees a few days ago telling me the bill IS correct and from now on my bill will be $218 a month??? I was furious. I have been calling a specific employee at Corporate (15 times) and can never get through. I have asked her to email me an answer: I agreed to pay the $144 plus $68 from past account and asked for an answer. I have received no specific response to that request. I am furious, will NOT pay $287 NOR will I pay $218 a month. I have threatened to cancel my service and have contacted DirecTV. I prefer to keep Comcast, but not at that price."
"Mar of Fredericksburg, VA",4/3/2015,,They simply tick up the cost of their services gradually over time and customers are completely helpless and unable to do anything about it.
"Carolyn of Glen Mills, PA",4/3/2015,,"Worst experience I have EVER had was with Comcast. It would take me two hours to write about a two month nightmare with this company. One person finally helped. His name is ** , Comcast Technician ** , from DelCo, lives in Aston, Pennsylvania. He should be running the company. Professional, thorough, highly competent and went way beyond to help with my service."
"Seteve of Alpharetta, GA",4/3/2015,,"I agree with others that the Customer service involves the first 45+ minutes on hold, then when you do get a shot, rarely ever helpful. But to add to this insult, My bill doubled. I was told not that I also have to pay for usage 300GB + along with the 45 for services, so Now I am at $80+ dollars a month for Internet Only. This seems illegal to have such a monopoly, meaning no other cable is allowed in the neighborhood, and be able to double the cost of internet without any change, no additional performance, no better customer service or billing practices, just a big increase in the bill for no justification. When asking and I am sure somewhere in the fineprint, somehow I agreed to this increase, at least that is what I am told. Anyone want to start a legal action, I am in."
"Alan of Edina, MN",4/3/2015,,"On 2-28-15 Comcast came to my home to repair two lines another tech called in as bad. The new tech showed up on time and tested the lines and said the noise on the lines was acceptable; he did not need to change the lines. I asked him if he had any of the new small digital boxes with the HDMI connections. I told him I would like to replace two of them. While I was waiting for him in one room he decided to do the swap in another room by himself, my wife and I both heard a crash. I went to the room to see what happen. There was my 36"" Samsung 6000 on the wood floor. Corner smashed bezel broken. Wood floor gouged! He called a supervisor who came out took some pictures. That's the last contact from Comcast. I have called 5 times talked to three supervisors all from the Philippines. Each told me they would get right back to me. Over a month has gone by and nothing. They are such a large company that you have no recourse if they don't call you back!"
"k of West Linn, OR",4/3/2015,,"I was working out of town and gave the girl who was watching my house and my dog money to pay my bill. She kept the cash and paid by check over the phone. The check bounced and I came home to a $694 bill with my cable turned off, that I am required to pay in full in order to get it turned back on. They said they will deduct $30 and thatâ€™s it. They will not work with me in any way which is **. I've been a customer of theirs for 20 years. If this does not get resolved, I will never use Comcast again and will tell anybody and everybody not to use them as well. Their customer service people are rude and cannot speak English. THEY NEED TO RESOLVE THIS ASAP!!"
"Karen of Buford, GA",4/4/2015,,"Needed service -- internet out for days. Was promised over and over that a tech would come out TODAY. Never happened. Then I find a scheduled appointment for the middle of the following week was set up when I won't even be home. Those previous appointments were just the reps making something up I suppose. Have school papers due online, so it's not like I'm missing checking my Facebook and social media accounts. I am incredibly disappointed. Never have I been so disgruntled -- I suppose what makes me the most angry are the lies... I cannot stand that."
"Janos of Dania, FL",4/4/2015,,"So disappointed with the lies and the customer service. When someone calls from Xfinity I just say ""Thanks for calling and I don't want anything from your company."" Constantly misinforming the customers and changing my bills for no reason. And when I call I feel like I am talking-to people who just don't give a crap. I just called this morning about my bill and the lady I talked to was so unprofessional. I was asking her to transfer me to a manager and she said the manager was not available. I was asking her to give me her last name or her worker ID but she refused. Then she told me that I wasn't even qualify for any promotion and hang up on me. If you read this please do yourself a favor and stay away from Comcast or Xfinity. Same company same garbage service."
"Anonymous of Fake City, UT",4/4/2015,,"Comcast is what happens when a company has a monopoly over an industry and could care less about the satisfaction of their victims. They are the only company in my area that offers cable internet, and it's been that way for decades. The price they charge for their service is never consistent, and they tack on new fees every month that you've never even heard of. Their prices gradually increase every year, yet they maintain the same slow cable internet speeds. They charge around $150 just for Internet and basic cable, which is ridiculously high seeing as how the costs of these technologies have gone way down.It's 2015 and they only offer around 20 mbps internet speeds to start, which is over 50x slower than Gigabit fiber internet, which is the standard internet speed in many Asian and European countries. On top of that they charge around $70/month for their slow internet, which is the same or even higher than most Gigabit ISP providers. They do everything they can to stop other companies from providing Gigabit internet to their customers, claiming that their speed is ""good enough"" for the customer's needs.They ONLY upgrade their speeds when competition starts to loosen their grips on their customers, like when the speed of DSL was nearly the same speed of their service for a lower price. Now Google Fiber is finally starting to shift the paradigm and offering super fast internet for the same or lower cost, and offering free internet just for the setup cost. I'm sincerely hoping that Google and other ISPs are able to provide true value and service that Comcast has always lacked."
"James of Stafford, VA",4/5/2015,,Xfinity advertises giving new customers a Visa prepaid card from $50-$200 for joining their Triple Play system. I've been waiting over 90 days to receive my prepaid card of $200. Is this a scam?
"Jacob of Niles, IL",4/5/2015,,"I have Comcast TV/Internet provider. On one of my three TVs, the On Demand feature does not work (other boxes work). My several contacts with tech support were fruitless. Each time it took hours to reset the system, wait until it is reloaded, etc. Yesterday, after another unsuccessful attempt to remedy the problem, I was told I need to get a new box. I exchanged the box today, but it still does not work. I had to contact tech support again and go through the same routine and I was assured that this time after reloading it should work. AND I WAS TOLD THAT THE COMCAST WILL CONTACT ME TONIGHT BETWEEN 5 AND 9 PM to check for results. Nobody contacted me and now the office is closed. This is outrageous! I will have to call them again and waste time... Comcast is a monopoly that controls the entire marketâ€¦"
"daniel of Newark, NJ",4/6/2015,,"This company should even been called a company. Their staff are not properly trained to deal with any situation. They charge you with things, they can't even explain why there are different charges every month. I can even stand how they say that they ""Guarantee customer satisfaction."" Word of advice, DO NOT GET COMCAST AS YOUR PROVIDER!!!"
"John of Independence, MO",4/6/2015,,"Feb 18 I was never told about the hundred dollar installation fee I was overcharged for my installation paying for 2 extra lines that would never installed in equipment I never had...... I lost my sister in the middle of March and ask customer service if I made a $200 payment would I be able to pay the $98 by May 1st or second. I was told ""You do not work out payments."" And my cable and internet will be shut off by the seven days. What I explain to them I only get paid once a month. I am retired military the service would be shut off in 7 days as it will explain to me I was with AT&T for a long time you guys make AT&T look like angels. I have never had such a bad experience on the phone with ** and ** and sold it so many times straight up lied to. Fortunately my phone calls are recorded. Never let the person who took my call when asked said anything about $100 installation fee. They told me my bill would only be $120 a month. It was then they did not mention the $8 equipment rental fee, was never mentioned in the car. Even my installation was very substandard yet I was charged 42 extra lines that were never installed in my house. Comcast is straight-up liars. I have recorded phone calls that I am going to put on YouTube. I'm also going to talk to attorney."
"hermanto of Littleton, CO",4/6/2015,,"We were moving out and requested Comcast Xfinity to disconnect our service two weeks prior to moving out. The following month Comcast continued to charge a full month service beyond the disconnection date. I called and inquired this, and the answer was, ""We continue to charge in case our customer changes his mind."" Our disconnection request was not heeded, and they charged although we no longer are in the house. BEWARE of this company and its business practice. Ten days later, and we have not been reimbursed for this charge. COMCAST should be in trouble for such business practices."
"Chris of Fort Campbell, KY",4/7/2015,,"Back in December 2014 I cancelled my account with Comcast due to the fact that the internet was not 50 mb that they claim it to be, it was more like 10 mb on a good day. So sent my equipment back to the local store, dealt with a very rude customer service rep. Was told that i would receive a final bill within 60 days. Well long story short, was never sent a bill from Comcast, which in turned sent my bill to some collection agency. I then called the collection agency to find what was going on. So at that time i filed a BBB complaint. Got a call from someone claiming to be from the Executive Office of Comcast. Boy let me tell you, that employee represented the company at its finest. Rude, No help, even more rude, had a attitude like i was wasting her time and offer no solution.. Told the young lady that I wanted to speak to someone higher up and had to explain to this fun employee that she wasn't the top of comcast and that I wanted to speak to someone higher. She put in the 24 hr request so we will see what happens."
"Dusty of Madera, CA",4/7/2015,,"I called Comcast for an XFINITY package that they were advertising in late November. They had advertised $250 or a Samsung Tablet after 3. I told the sales rep that I was interested but that I would have to wait until late December for My DirecTV commitment to expire. He told me that I could sign up now for installation then and informed me that I qualified for free instillation. So I signed up. My first reflected an installation charge and was a bit more than I was quoted. I called and complained that I was informed that I had ""free Installation."" They said that I had free installation for 4 TV and I had 5 installed. I argued that I was not informed by the sales representative or the installer that there would be a charge for the fifth TV and eventually (after taking to 2 people for 45 minutes each) asked to talk to a manager who instantly offered to half the installation bill and lower my monthly bill. I was happy with that so I paid my first bill and signed up for auto pay. The next bill was higher than expected so I called. After being told about 50 by 2 people that's just what my bill is and getting mad, I hung up and the next person explained that I was undercharged $50 the bill before. I checked my bank account and they were right, so I paid it and the next month auto pay kicked in. Now it's April 7th and no $250, so I called and was told that I was delinquent $50 so I did not qualify for it... MAD!!! I argued that it was no fault of my own and that I had paid my bill but was not charged the full price. I got ""I understand but there's nothing we can do about it."" Not cool! They gave me $50 discount and Showtime for 3 months..... It's something but it's not the $250 I was promised! Oh and to make all that more insulting, they said that it was for $100 only!"
"Gary of Fort Wayne, IN",4/7/2015,,Our phones are our livelihood and Comcast has shown no sense of urgency to resolve this problem.
"Thomas of Spotsylvania, VA",4/7/2015,,"I found out today that Comcast will not connect cable to my residence into which I'm moving. I separated from my wife 2 years ago and she stayed in the residence until she could find a place to go. Our entire marriage she had the cable in her name. She stopped paying after I moved out. Now she left the residence and I am moving back in. I contacted Comcast to connect a new cable account for me. They told me there was a block on the address.I called find out what was going on and they said they didn't care that it was a new account. They ""won't"" turn the service on for that address. Then they said the only way they would turn on service is if I call my ex-wife and get her to pay, or I could pay myself, even though I ""don't have to"". That is basic ""strong arm tactics"". It's not right that I have to pay another person's debt in order to get internet. I explained to them that I work from home and needed internet. They said that's way more of a reason to do their job and get my ex wife to pay..."
"Paula of Canton, GA",4/8/2015,,"The second month of a new account was double billed. I have called over 15 times and spent 20+ hours on the phone trying to get someone at customer service to correct the billing. If I'm lucky enough to get someone on the phone that can even pull up my account, they say they've never seen this before and need to submit it to billing for an investigation. Then, I never hear from anyone regarding the mistake. My account is now set to disconnect for the 3rd time. The double billing is their mistake, but I get to pay for it in wasted time and frustration."
"Jennifer of Knoxville, TN",4/8/2015,,"I've had Comcast internet, TV and phone service for almost 3 years. I purchased my own modem from Best Buy (I have receipt and box spent $189) so I didn't have to rent from Comcast for $7-$10 a month. About 3 months after the start of service I received my first letter stating during a review of my account they have noticed I am not paying the modem rental. I called and stated it was my modem and so therefore I did not need to pay them. Oh yes they said sorry about that and removed the charges. Now every 2 months since this first letter I get another letter stating the same thing!! I've called approximately 20 times to correct this problem. I've given them the receipt, and personally gone into the office (and talked to the employees making minimum wage and unable to do anything about my issue). No one seems to know what is going on or why I'm constantly being charged for my own equipment!! One employee has made a ""ticket"" which was supposed to go to a higher employee and they would contact me. This never happened!! I could go on with the other issues we have had such as our sudden extremely large increase in broadband usage when nothing changed in our house! Supposedly we went from using 21GB a month to over 300GB! Really? The only thing we did was supposedly upgrade our service so the only difference is on the Comcast end!! I was previously in another state with Suddenlink and boy do I wish we were still in their area! Comcast is absolutely the worst company I have ever used!! If I could give them zero stars I would!!"
"Carol of Lawrenceville, GA",4/8/2015,,"Consumer beware. I found out that my internet usage has been capped at 300 gb only after I received an outrageous bill from Comcast. Apparently, they are now allowing up to 300 gb of data usage only, and after exceeding this limit you are charged an additional $10 per 50gb thereafter. Apparently, they are only doing this so called test in certain areas of the country and are working on making this a national requirement. It may not be affecting you now but if you're a Comcast customer, it will be affecting you soon. If this isn't gouging the customer I don't know what is. Where is the regulatory force on this one? It's only a matter of time Comcast. We are at a day and age when it's nearly impossible to do anything without using the internet. Just about every facet of our lives are intertwined with data usage such as school, bill pay, entertainment, research, business, banking, etc., the list goes on and you go and pull this **? Sucker the consumer in and stick it to them, the American way eh Comcast? Too bad I don't have any other options, you would have been canned a long time ago, but somehow I think you know that."
"Matt of Houston, TX",4/9/2015,,"From the very beginning, we've had nothing but problems with Comcast's Internet service. The service will randomly drop and sometimes not return for hours. Every time we call regarding these happenings, Comcast blames our ""outdated hardware,"" regardless of the fact that own the most up-to-date Motorola modem that is on the market. Regardless, this is all beside the point.I've had a few dealings recently with Comcast support, and they've only seem to become more and more condescending and less helpful with each conversation. I currently work for Apple from home, and we're set to move into a different unit in our complex at the beginning of next month. Given that they advertise that their Movers Edge service provides a completely seamless transition between locations, I figured it'd be worth setting up a transfer. I was told the transition would take 48 hours. Correct me if I'm wrong, but 48 hours doesn't really fall under the umbrella of ""seamless"" as far as how most average human being interpret words. We're not allotted time to move. We have to do it completely on our own time. So now, thanks to Comcast, I'm going to be forced to take an unpaid day (complete with negative attendance points) due to the fact that they're advertising more than they can actually do for you. Then again, I shouldn't be surprised at this point. Nothing ever works out how it should with this company.My two biggest pieces of advice:1. Hire employees who are mentally capable of actually empathizing with customers, and who can even remotely come across like they have any idea what they're talking about.2. Advertise your services exactly as you provide them. I equate Comcast with used cars salesmen at this point. They do and say whatever they need to do to get you in, and then offer no help once you're there."
"Linda of Newark, DE",4/9/2015,,"I received my monthly Comcast bill today and it was for $448.84, double the regular amount. Comcast decided on its own to automatically bill me for the MLB package which we didn't request or authorize. In prior years we had ordered the MLB package. When we called Comcast their response was we must have authorized the charge last year, however, they weren't able to access previous years records. This is fraudulent and their hope is we won't check our bill and automatically pay it. Their only response to this horrible practice was to credit our account for the charges. Comcast didn't offer to make things right. We are calling other providers so we can cancel Comcast."
"Kim of Machesney Park, IL",4/9/2015,,"I am so tired of this company. They are nothing, but a monopoly of ripping people off. I have been a loyal customer since 2008. I have always paid my bill every month. When I signed up I was told what my bill would every month for the package I purchased. I now get a letter in the mail that from my 132.88 bill, that again, I pay every month I now owe $428.11. So, I called and I was told some nonsense about â€œyou must have missed a paymentâ€, but I cannot go that far back. I was upset. How can it be that I have the same package, and I have not missed a payment that all a sudden I owe almost three times what my suppose to be monthly bill is. She told me â€œwell Comcast bills a month in advance. You must have missed a paymentâ€, again she says I cannot go back that far. How could I typically miss a payment and have service? My statements always put me a month behind anyway, because of their ridiculous billing practices. When truly I am never past due. I make my payment every month, just like my electric, water bill, cell phone bill, etc. I have come to the conclusion that I will switch from this awful company. Do they care what their loyal customers or customers think? The answer is no! As long as they can keep making mega dollars hand over foot, while ripping people off they will. It's just disgusting that this is a company."
"Shellee of Bedford , IN",4/9/2015,,I called about my internet service for the second time; it's not worked and I pay my bill. They said they'd lower the bill by $20. She asked me about Comcast TV and I said maybe in the future. I got a pack in the mail today w/ Comcast remote and box... I DID NOT say yes to that. Now I have to go to a UPS store to send back and my bill is probably screwed. Not happy at all.
"Mohammed of Wakefield, MA",4/9/2015,,"A few days ago, I spoke to a salesperson to get service. I agreed to pay $109 without phone service, and that was the deal I made with them, plus $12 extra in order for me to get 105 Mbps of internet speed. I was also charged for three boxes. When the technician showed up and set up my service in my home, I got 12 Mbps instead of 105 Mbps. When I asked him why this had happened, he said that I should call the company so they could send me a technician from a different department to get a booster so I could get the internet speed I originally paid for. One of the customer service representatives told me to go to Best Buy and purchase the booster since the company didn't have them anymore. Another representative told me that my area does not have 105 Mbps. Now I am getting confused because the salesperson told me that I could get 105 Mbps, and the website also says I can get 105 Mbps. But now, the customer service representative is telling me that I cannot reach 105 Mbps, so now I'm confused. I'm urging every Comcast customer to check their internet speed, and see if it's what they're paying for. Comcast lies about what they promise to provide, and overcharges!"
"Joana of New York, NY",4/9/2015,,"It's so frustrating to down $250/month to have trouble with service almost 90% of the time. I get anxiety just trying to change channels. Everything freezes and most of the time I get a ""we are having trouble connecting to the server"" message. Canâ€™t wait to switch to another company. Called customer service more than 3 times, get someone on the other end that is clearly reading from a script and has no idea what they're saying."
"Gary of Seattle, WA",4/9/2015,,"Does Comcast (Xfinity) deliberately mislead and tell untruths to its customers? That has been my experience on several occasions. What's that $4.99 a month ""service protection plan"" that I explicitly declined? Why am I being charged $1.99 a month for an ""additional outlet""? Yes, ** in Guadalajara tells me, ""that's a mistake."" So why does it remain on my bill month after month? Why are they charging me $14.99 for Showtime when they told me they are giving me that as a free promotion for a month? I told them that I didn't want Showtime!I've spent way too many hours (and I mean HOURS) on the phone when my new digital set-top box refused to cooperate. On two Sundays in a row I was unable to tune into 60 Minutes on CBS. Error message says 'the channel is temporarily not accessible.' It happens that a number of channels were not accessible. ""Don't worry,"" ** assures me. She promises a refund for the service outages and tells me she will send me an email describing the refund. No email and no refund were ever received. ""We can't email you,"" another customer service representative in the Philippines tells me in a subsequent call. And he adds that they are not authorized to arrange any refunds or tackle billing problems.Does Comcast school their army of customer services representatives to lie to customers? Has Comcast consciously erected walls between billing, tech support and service reps to maximum customer frustration? Do they have a playbook for that? Maybe 60 Minutes has investigated this phenomenon. Unfortunately, I can't see 60 Minutes these days."
"Bob of Colchester, CT",4/10/2015,,"Have a monthly bill of 231.58. That's two thousand seven hundred and seventy-eight dollars and 96 cents per year. I wrote out the yearly expense as it adds to the dismay of payment vs service, vs the capability to switch to another company, vs unbundle. It has been made almost impossible to switch to another company due to the inability of possibilities. What zip code area are you in? What services are available in that area? Why can DISH be used, or another similar service? Comcast's service is. â€œHere is what we can offer.â€ â€œNo we cannot do that.â€ â€œDisconnect my landlineâ€. ""Youâ€™re bundled sir"". ""I can give you basic service sir"". Frustrating!"
"Greg of Pittsburgh, PA",4/10/2015,,"WARNING: Under no circumstances should you consider Xfinity Home Security. We recently installed Xfinity Home Security in our home in San Francisco. The Comcast representative knew we would be moving soon to Pittsburgh PA and assured us that we could transfer our service. Nothing could be further from the truth. We had to battle for weeks to get the service transferred and we had a horrible battle over an early termination fee. Comcast incorrectly billed us twice for installation and we spent days and days on the phone with call center people who could not correct the problem. In the meantime, we needed to disconnect the system for 4 to 6 months while we renovated our home. Comcast refused to discontinue the billing while we had the system shut down. Keep in mind we are paying our Comcast bill at our other address in Pittsburgh.After a two-month battle with Comcast, we gave up and returned our Comcast equipment. Comcast told us we needed to return the additional motion detectors we had paid for. We received no refund for the equipment that we had purchased. Several weeks later, we get a call from Comcast Customer Solutions now saying they would consider allowing us a six-month billing delay while we renovated. We asked them how could we ever get our bill corrected? They didn't know. We asked them if we would now be charged for a third installation fee? They did not know. We asked them if we were going to have to buy the additional motion detectors again? They did not know. We respectfully asked them to forgive the early termination fee and they said THEY WOULD PURSUE US FOR THE EARLY TERMINATION FEE.Keep in mind, I am paying a monthly fee for Comcast services at my current address. I asked ** if the several hundred dollar early termination fee was worth losing a customer who will be paying Comcast for another 20 or 30 years and he said the early termination fee was more important. We have been a Comcast customer for over 25 years and we are winding down ALL of our services with Comcast. On a scale of 0 to 10, there is not a number low enough to rate Comcast."
"Kristen of Modesto, CA",4/10/2015,,"This complaint is based on my current Comcast service. 3-4 days out of 30 my service is out. I am currently a full time student and I require the internet to complete assignments, and this is of no concern to Comcast. I have had slow internet, cable channels that are forever pixelating, they send a technician that never fixes anything. This service is expensive and horrible."
"Eden of San Francisco, CA",4/10/2015,,"I stopped using Comcast's miserable and expensive internet service more than three weeks ago. I personally took their rental modem to their customer service facility at 260 Potrero Ave San Francisco, CA three weeks ago today. I showed them the Comcast confirmation of a $50 cash deposit on the modem rental and requested a return of the $50 deposit. The CS rep stated that she could not return deposit money despite the confirmation that I was owed the $50. Presumably it was to be mailed. Three weeks later and still no $50."
"Terri of Mobile, AL",4/10/2015,,"My bill kept going up and I finally took the time to review all the services. I realized I was paying for a service that I never had, asked for or needed. I spent almost 2 hours trying to talk to someone, only to be transferred to non-Americans that I couldn't understand and that would eventually hang up in the middle of a statement. I can't get any answers and these are the worse people I've ever dealt with. I am looking for new service now. I would never recommend Comcast. They are a rip-off and increase your bill continuously. Thank you Comcast for destroying my nerves today."
"Greg of Pittsburgh, PA",4/10/2015,,"We recently moved from San Francisco to Pittsburgh PA and had VERY PAINFUL experience with Comcast. As it turns out, Comcast San Francisco has nothing to do with Comcast Pittsburgh. After being a 25-year customer with Comcast, Comcast almost immediately cut off our Comcast email addresses. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES CONSIDER USING A COMCAST EMAIL ADDRESS.Comcast refused to forward our email! Seriously. We were using our Comcast email address to communicate with our real estate agent, our banker, our lawyer, our contractor, our architect, not to mention our friends and family. ABSOLUTELY CUT OFF WITH NO FORWARD. We also had our Comcast email address tied to our travel partners i.e., Hertz, Avis, United Airlines, Delta Airlines, Marriott, etc. IF YOU ARE USING A COMCAST EMAIL ADDRESS, YOU SHOULD MIGRATE TO GMAIL OR ANY OTHER OPTION THAT WILL NOT HOLD YOU HOSTAGE AND BLOCK YOUR ACCOUNT. Comcast did this knowing that we would be adding Comcast to two additional properties in Pittsburgh. We are now in the process of ending all of our business with Comcast. They need to go out of business."
"mai of Clute, TX",4/10/2015,,"I called in to ask about my bill. They said that they have a new promotion that I can apply. I think that's a good deal so that I agreed to join. At the end of the month, they sent me a bill for $263, with $15 installed kit for internet services. They didn't do a single thing. They scheduled a tech to come out to look to see why I couldn't connect to internet. Over the phone, the lady said that as long as that guy not doing inside my house, they will not charge me. Guess what, they charged me $35 and the tech didn't step a foot inside my house. They charged us $99 for upgrade to their new X1 Platform technology. We have to pay for their upgrade. I don't need X1 platform. And they didnâ€™t even mention that in the call. Do not even think about this company for internet and TV services. Comcast is the worst customer service. You will regret for sure."
"Katherine of Citrus Heights, CA",4/10/2015,,"Promotion scam: signed up with the Xfinity bundle with a bonus iPad Mini. I was reluctant to choose the bundle but was swayed with the offer of the tablet. I spoke with three different representatives about the iPad. Each rep explained that after 90 days from my sign up, it would still take another 60-90 days for processing. Seven months later when I called in, I was informed I was not going to receive the promotional deal because I did not pay the advanced billing cycles, yet my service was not ever terminated and Comcast gladly took my $200.00+ amount every month without informing me I was to no longer receive the promotion deal.Unreliable network: voice calls - periodically people would reach a busy tone or continued ringing with no voicemail available while I was home alone not using my phone. No explanation when the tech came to my home and investigated the issue. I witnessed it after a few people told me about calling and not getting through, I called my home phone to check it out. Cable - very slow and freezes. Constantly unplugging my cable boxes and tolerating long waiting periods for menus to load or the cable box reconnecting. Sporadic periods of ""this function is not available"" and ""try again laters."""
"Shawn of Jewett City, CT",4/10/2015,,"Comcast is a crook! I have had Comcast for YEARS. Recently I moved... Prior to moving I used their ""handy"" moving site and input my address... Boom I ""have service"". I sign my papers, go to make my service appointment and am told they donâ€™t provide service to my area. I look closer, they were auto-populating another address! When I call to have my early termination fee waived I was transferred for over 2 hours, hung up on (or the call ""dropped"") 3 times. I was told there is nothing I can do, I signed up. Thatâ€™s BS. Iâ€™ve been a customer for years! What does loyalty get you these days.... NOTHING. I didnâ€™t want to leave Comcast, but now I wonâ€™t go back. Too many other options with no contracts. $800 for early termination! I pay less than that a year for service. I will report them everywhere I can and make people aware. They arenâ€™t the only provider and I wonâ€™t go back."
"Dorian of Somerset, VA",4/11/2015,,"I used Comcast and the internet never worked for a year. I called and wrote but no one could fix it. Switched back to verizon and it works Great. Comcast LIES. FIOS is faster and more reliable and something needs to be done about the false advertising from COMCAST/Xfinity saying their service is faster than FIOS when it doesn't work at all . NO JOKE. IT never connects, then if you get lucky, its slow or it kicks you out. Please do not subscribe to them.. A Big rip off and the FCC needs to do something."
"Margaret of Spokane Valley , WA",4/11/2015,,"I serviced Comcast customers through an independent contractor and had service with Comcast. Let's begin, I signed up with Comcast some years ago. I do not like being lied to. The agent had told me I would receive their triple pay for 99.00/mo. When I received my first bill, I was billed 132.00. When I didn't pay, they had a company called Midland Credit call me. Well they did not follow procedure and a class action lawsuit was filed against this company. An attorney sent me a letter with confirmation that I qualified for a credit of 1000.00. I signed back up with Comcast, was given the same above run-around. I paid 132.00/mo for endless repeated shows/movies (pay-per-view is not included with the monthly service fee). The programming is not updated, maybe every 6-7 months. I have not received any credit for anything. The internet connection was constantly breaking even during my servicing for Comcast. It was simple, Comcast got the contractor to do their dirty work for them. How can you sell a service to Comcast customers who are having issues? You can't!!! I would get calls from some pissed off customers. Techs never arrived to the servicing address, credit was never applied and connections with these customers were constantly dropped. I had one customer call and he was paying over 300.00 for the service and was having issues!!!Anyway, I was charged an early termination fee of 200.00. I didn't terminate the service, Comcast did. I was even charged for returning the equipment and they charged me for a month of service I never received. I serviced the company and they didn't even give me a break!!! And this is the kicker, I received an email stating they had an opening for a sales position!!! What a joke!!! I tried to get service with Earthlink, I could not because they partnered with Comcast. Isn't the consumer entitled to a choice? And why is Comcast getting away with dominating the industry? As far as I am concerned, it is a monopoly and a monopoly is illegal in this country. One other complaint, the new credit agency calling, will call you 3 times a day until the bill is paid (as stated by their agent). Looks like another class action lawsuit against Comcast."
"Jerrilyn of Wash, DC",4/11/2015,,I have called Comcast numerous times and can never get anyone on the line. It's as if they want you to give up and hang up. Don't call trying to get a payment extension. They never answer the phone. What's with that???
"R. B. of Chicago, IL",4/12/2015,,"I do not understand how this company is still in business. They have the worst customer service. I specifically told the person who set-up my account that we do not need a modem because we already have one. And surprise! They charged me for the modem. Instead of closing our old account a month ago when we asked them to do so, it is still active. When we got the new cable box, it was added it on the old account... Apparently they cannot add the box to my new account so therefore my cable is not working. Overall I spent 7 hours on the phone over this weekend and nothing happened. Please do not use this company!! It is a shame that the authorities do not do anything about this company."
"Laqua of Detroit, MI",4/12/2015,,"I started out with only home security and wifi with Comcast. An independent contractor with comcast sold me on adding cable services to my existing account for only $30 extra per month - that was 30 days ago. My services have only worked for maybe 10 days out of the 30. They have sent 3 technicians out who have all screwed up even more! The agents I speak to on the phone don't care, they won't even credit me the days I had no service. And the kicker is they allow me to cancel because they changed my contract when they signed me up for services so I'm obligated with Xfinity home for 2 years or I have to pay a $900 cancellation fee! I was not notified that they changed my contract. Had I known that I would have never added services! My bill is over $200 when it was only supposed to be $130 per month! I am extremely upset."
"Pamela of Hershey, PA",4/12/2015,,"Once again, Comcast has outdone itself in delivering abominable customer service. A week ago, I notice a significant dip in my FICO Score provided by my Credit union. I immediately pulled credit reports and found a submission from a collections agency. I called them and they informed me Comcast had turned an amount due from 2011 over to them for collections. I called Comcast and after being transferred about 3 times, spoke to someone who informed me I owed a balance on an account I had back in 2011. I asked â€œwhy I had received nothing in the mail from Comcast in the PAST 4 YEARSâ€, and they had no answer. I eventually determined, that because I got my bills via email, and when I closed the Comcast account I no longer had access to that email address, I was uninformed about the amount due. I did some research, and determined to the best of my knowledge, that this was around the time I switched carriers and figured I probably owed it, so I paid it. I then spend another hour and a half being transferred from inept representative to inept representative trying to connect me to the imaginary ""Collections Department"" to have this blunder removed from my Credit report and restore my pristine credit rating. I eventually got a phone number for Equifax and was told that COMCAST WOULD NOT fix this. I have tried to send an email or even find an address to send correspondence to, but without an active account, I cannot access a location. Any advice would be appreciated."
"Douglas of Chicago, IL",4/13/2015,,"My medical office had Comcast business internet for several years. A year ago, I retired and closed the office when I turned 75. I moved the fast service to my home. I am now moving out of state so I requested the service be shut off. Comcast said when the service was moved, a new contract started and I have to pay a $2,300 early termination fee. In the contract, they were giving me a $10 discount from $109 to $99 monthly which explains the termination fee. A company engaging in a shameless grift. Truly pathetic. Elizabeth Warren is right. Big Corporations lie and cheat people and think nobody will stop them. Have they no shame?"
"Keissy of Palmetto Bay, FL",4/13/2015,,"3 months ago, we activated an acct with Comcast. From day 1, they have been unable to install our service, but have been extremely quick at sending us notices stating we have a balance owed. 5 Technicians that have been unable to resolve our issue and over 15 calls to customer service, to which we have had VERY RUDE, unprofessional representatives disconnect our calls in way more than one occasion."
"Lynn of Brentwood, TN",4/13/2015,,"I have bundle service and it all went out last Thursday morning. After talking to customer service several times, the repair date will be 12 days later! So, I am left without TV, Internet, telephone and my security alarm!"
"Mallory of Lafayette , TN",4/13/2015,,"I signed up with Xfinity in March 2015. I got my bill for the first month with was 175 and some change which was understandable I am a new customer and I had connection fees. I also downloaded an app on my smartphone so I could check my account. When I got on it, my account showed that I owe almost 300!! I called them and they told me that they bill new customers for two months of service during the first month. I was never told this when I started my account. I never got a second bill in the mail. All I got was unexplained charges on my account. I've had service for not even a month now and I'm already ready to switch cable providers. It's complete bs that they're going to bill me for two months in advance and make the payment days not even a month apart. So I now have a 175 bill due April 15th and a 116 bill due May 1st! My mom has been dealing with them charging her account twice a month for amounts that are WAY more then she should be paying. Her normal bill is 116 they take that out and then a week like go back and take out another $400 out of her account for NO REALLY. I won't stand for that I will be switching providers. Beware when choosing Xfinity they will just screw you over. And take you for your money."
"Rufus of Seattle, WA",4/14/2015,,"Comcast is horrible at customer service mostly because the people you always talk to are so far removed from you, usually India - they have no idea what we are dealing with over here. I will make a list problems I've had with them and they are apparently reoccurring to a sickening degree.They always raise the price of my bill which I've read happens to people all the time, adding on ** extras that I never asked for. I have had to call and complain about this about 7 or 8 times in the last few years. The way they always try to resolve this is to give you a 'package deal' which only would result in me paying more money, another tactic that I found out is always used to scam customers. This way they make you think they are saving you money and giving you such a good deal.They always say they will change something or adjust your bill and it might change for a month or two and then surprise, next month it's back up again. And no one is held accountable, if you ask them for their names they say, ""We are not allowed to divulge that information"" so you can never say this specific person promised me blah blah blah and make someone accountable. The only way to beat this I've read is to record all your calls with them and they also have I.D. Numbers so you have to ask them for their ID numbers. But you have to be religious about doing these things and keep track of every detail to use later. They transfer your calls like nobody's business, back and forth between departments so if you have a detailed problem you have to explain it thoroughly 5 times before someone can actually address your problem.They also pretend like they can't change your bills themselves when in fact many of these people can. The last battle I had with them I got transferred 3 times when I was about to quit Comcast for good because a new company just moved into my area (Seattle) and I was telling them it's possible for me to pay less. Only then do they listen to you and this woman finally just clicked a button and changed my bill back to 49.95$ per month. And this was after I got a bill for 88.45$ for my monthly charge. And this woman was actually American - after talking to two foreigners they finally transferred me to someone local because they knew I was ready to quit and none of these workers likes to have that on their record because it looks bad on their quotas or how ever they do it.And finally after all this pretending like she went out of her way to work really hard to look for a deal she could offer me she promised me to change my bill back to 49 and some change when I check it the next day and it still shows up as 88.45$ that I owe so I am just about to call the map once again to complain. I broke my own rule when I forgot to ask for her ID number to keep her accountable.In conclusion I am still constantly looking for a company that is willing to start offering a decent rate for internet service. Comcast is a horrible monopoly for the most part and it's only getting worse. They are buying up smaller companies that can't compete just swallowing them up one by one, like Charter and smaller local companies. Please everybody keep posting your bad reviews and spreading the word, they are just treating customers horribly because they can and we need to stop putting up with it."
"Jeff of Chicago, IL",4/14/2015,,I went back to Comcast (Big Mistake) after over 8 years of getting rid of them the first time. Gave one price to lower as special and got my next bill which was 45 dollars higher. Also was charging me for a modem that I own. Supervisor I spoke with was rude and would not listen. Don't want to even give it a 1 star. Horrible company. 
"Theodore of Chiago, IL",4/14/2015,,"We recently moved to a new building about 5 miles from my former residence. My phone number was changed because of this location change. My old phone number was therefore disconnected. ""Comcast.net"" terminated my email service when my phone number changed. Also my current building is serviced by ""rcn.com"" (not by comcast.net).Comcast terminated our service when we were assigned a new telephone number in a part of the city which is not serviced by Comcast. Comcast will not release my Address Book information unless I re-open a Comcast account. But Comcast does not provide internet service in my apartment building and in the neighborhood where I have moved to. Comcast wants me to re-open my Comcast email account but they do not provide email service where I now live. How is this solution by Comcast possible??"
"Sharon of Brentwood, TN",4/15/2015,,"My home wifi was not working all of a sudden on April 13 and I contacted Comcast online to attempt to have it fixed. A woman named ** was working with me and told me I wasn't receiving a signal and would need to plug my modem into my PC. I explained I did not have a PC, only a smartphone and a laptop. She gave me a telephone number to call for help. When calling the number, it was answered as a ""non-working number for Comcast"". I went back to her and told her this and she gave me two more phone numbers, one which went to Verizon and another which also went to a ""non-working number for Comcast"". I double checked these numbers for accuracy against what she had typed to me. I promptly told this was absolutely pathetic. I got offline and called Comcast, only to be told that my equipment wasn't registered, which is nonsense, as it has been in use for over two years and had worked the previous day. In the meantime, a signal was present only to not work. I called Comcast again and spoke with **, who was very nice but it took some fiery language on my part to him in admonishing Comcast for the incompetence and negligence I had been subjected to for no reason. I told him I wanted to know why my internet was down and what needed to be done to fix it and I didn't want to hear another word out of him except for answers to those questions. After several minutes of back and forth and my basically telling him to get an answer for me this minute, he came back to tell me my Comcast modem is apparently now ""old equipment"" and must be exchanged. I found this ridiculous, especially given the fact that the previous two people at Comcast never mentioned this! How does this happen? The modem worked on April 13 and all of a sudden on April 14 it does not. No notice is sent from Comcast regarding any required equipment changes, it just happens and you are out of luck but still have to pay them? When are the powers that be going to wake up to their scams? ** told me to disconnect the modem and take it to Comcast to be exchanged. So it will be tomorrow afternoon (April 16) before I can do this so I will be without internet service for 3 days and they will still expect me to pay them? This company should not be allowed to be in businessâ€¦ Where is the Better Business Bureau on this? I have had other mind boggling instances in dealing with them as well and their customer service continues to be the worst of any company I have ever dealt withâ€¦ Why is Comcast allowed to continue to treat their customers in this manner?"
"J of Salt Lake City, UT",4/15/2015,,"Comcast/Xfinity is the absolute worst internet service I've ever used. I am counting down the days until I move out of this apartment and can switch back to CenturyLink. My internet is INCREDIBLY slow, with regular delays. It doesn't make any difference which device I'm using -- it's always slow. Nightly, around 11pm, the internet strength reduces significantly to the point that whatever I'm watching on Netflix, Hulu, or YouTube through my AppleTV freezes, taking forever to reload, and repeating this process until I eventually give up and go to sleep. I will NEVER NEVER NEVER solicit service from Comast or Xfinity again. It's essentially useless. ** XFINITY!!!"
"andrea of Cambridge, MA",4/15/2015,,"When I walked into the local Comcast store to pick up a new cable box, the young woman at the desk noticed that I had been billed for a piece of equipment that I never requested, had, or used. She said that I had been billed for this ""adapter"" or something like that, since 2009 and should be reimbursed (or credited) by Comcast. (She was lovely.)Fast forward about a year, I returned to Comcast to see about what had been done about the overcharging and it appears nothing had been done. I was assured that it would be fixed and was given a ticket number. Bear in mind that I have automatic deductions (from my bank account) for my monthly bill, and Comcast has not sent either paper or electronic bills in years.As per my request, I received an electronic bill the other day. They only credited me for the last six months of overbilling. I called and was told that the two agents that I had spoken with in person were wrong about my reimbursement - that Comcast has a strict policy that they will only, in essence, fix any of their mistakes from the last six months. I explained that I had spoken with someone a year ago and nothing was done. I also explained that I had no knowledge of being overcharged since they never sent me a bill.I'm basically an easy-going person, but when something this egregious happens to me, and most probably is also happening to others, I became, well, apparently 1 Star indicates ""angry"" so I'll leave it at that. I'm waiting for a supervisor to call me back (I'm not holding my breath) but the amount of time I've already spent trying to remedy THEIR mistake is ridiculous. How can they operate a business where they recognize their mistake and yet only agree to repay a small portion of a sum that they realize was erroneously deducted from my bank account?"
"Tatiana of Miami, FL",4/15/2015,,"I signed a 2 years contract with Comcast with the only condition that they respect my monthly amount during this time and 2 months after sign the contract, they increased my bill and the answer of the supervisor was ""Pay the bill or pay the penalty if you want to cancel."" I hate the service of Comcast"
"John of Nashville, TN",4/15/2015,,"Where do I start - from the beginning we've had trouble with these crooks. Installation was flawed - called and was promised a tech MULTIPLE times - no shows. Finally I went to their office in person and raised hell with a manager who tried to threaten me - that didn't work (helps to know the law....). Finally had two techs with the proper equipment show up to fix MULTIPLE issues with the original crap installation. Since then we've had multiple service outages. OnDemand often throws a ""service not available"" message, internet speeds vary DRAMATICALLY, and tonight I'm trying to watch a movie and the soundtrack gets garbled about every 5 minutes making me have to pause the movie and then restart it to fix audio. HOW ON EARTH can these idiots continue to be in business and be allowed to provide such completely incompetent service??? Can anyone spell CLASS ACTION against these twits? To charge what they do and fail to provide acceptable, consistent service is criminal."
"Sheila of Dover, DE",4/15/2015,,"Did not receive my card for refer a friend. My Friend received Comcast services on December 1, 2014.  April 14, 2015 comcast stated we cannot receive the Visa card because I paid my bill on March 8 instead of March 1. Will be getting a rocky $69 system and fire my cable company."
"Amanda of Baltimore, MD",4/15/2015,,"I have never been so infuriated by terrible service! For 2 months my husband and I tried to cancel our Comcast account but continued to receive charges. When we scheduled for the technicians to come to our home and collect our Comcast electronics, they didn't show up THREE TIMES! We had to take off work and stayed home on 3 different occasions for them to never show up... no notice. After 9-10 calls over the past two months, we were continually redirected from department to department. We were made promises of not being charged, promises of lowering our bill if we stayed on as customers, and yet, our bill never changed from its original amount nor did the technicians ever come to the house after multiple attempts to reschedule. Each time we spoke on the phone with someone new from multiple departments, we received different answers and different promises. For 2 months this has been going on. Finally we requested call logs to be listened to by the supervisors from February of 2015. This has yet to happen. We will be canceling our services, refusing to pay, and never ever again using Comcast services no matter where we move. It has been a nightmare experience all around. This company needs to under. I don't even want to rate 1 star. I'd like rate as many negative stars as possible. My husband and I and our families are all in full agreement that Comcast is the worst company in America. Shame on you Comcast. Worst service we hope to ever experience."
"Ellen of Shakopee, MN",4/16/2015,,"My internet, cable and phone service all went out. When the technician came out, my outside line had been cut. He said they had been in my neighborhood installing new lines and for some reason forgot to connect me to a new line after it was cut. They left the exposed cable across my yard and said it would be at least 6 weeks before they would be back to bury it. I asked, ""Why so long?"" and their response was that they had other jobs to fulfill. I asked why I would have to wait since it was their error and they had no reason other than ""that is the way it is."" Needless to say, I changed companies and am saving $102 a month for the same services! What a rip-off and poor customer service. It always pays to compare. I definitely learned something."
"Aaron of Clinton, MD",4/16/2015,,"Comcast was installed in my home on March 28. Comcast sent an email to me from a verification department on April 1 to verify information with a number and extension. Needless to say I've been calling them since then and yet to receive a callback today April 16. When I got home needless to say no cable, no internet, no phone and still no response or answer from the verification time and no one else in the entire place can seem to assist me. So as of right now no cable, no phone and a very dissatisfied Comcast Customer."
"hank of Canton, GA",4/16/2015,,"It appears Comcast has resorted to hanging up when you call to cancel your service. Really? Is this really happening? Here is the conversation:HER: I see that you've been with us for 38 years. Wow. Let's see now...(CLICK)Line goes dead. I thought...let's try again. 2nd call, same thing. They hang up. They offered me HBO and SHOWTIME for 1.00 each per month as an add-on. I said sure. But the programming is the same movies you would see on regular television, so I called to cancel. She tells me I will have to pay early termination fees of 75.00. I informed her that my entire contract was month-to-month with no term agreement. She says the two channels carry a 2-year term agreement. I tell her that that fact was somehow omitted when I agreed to it and that I refuse to pay the termination fee. She tells me that they will ""pull the recording of the conversation"" to see if the terms were mentioned(!) I was astonished. Now she's practically calling me a liar. The supervisor comes on the line. I explain the situation and she says there will be no charge for the early termination because it was a promotional offer, not in my contract. I tell her what the other person said and she says they were wrong. I make her notate that in the notes for my account. I'm thinking...doesn't the right hand know what the left is doing? We hang up and I pull up my emails. There is one from Comcast quoting my new rate which is 40.00 more than what I was told on the phone. I call back. They said to disregard the email.There is hope on the horizon, as of 4/16/15. Clark Howard says there is a new optic wire from Google that is being tested in Oklahoma that will put these companies out of business. It will offer more channels, internet speed that is 100X faster, and will cost about $70.00/month. The early tests are showing a 100% approval rating and customers love it. I can't wait. Now we will have the same internet speed as many European countries who already have that speed. Apparently the USA is lagging when it comes to internet offerings.Here is some advice that I've learned the hard way: (1) Always ask questions. Don't let them intimidate you; (2) make them notate on your account ANYTHING they commit to. They can add it to the notes and it can't be overlooked then; (3) Always get the person's name. So many times they have asked me...who were you speaking with?; (4) Watch your statement like a hawk. Don't let anything slide, not even small fees. Call them and show them you mean business.I have already decided that if they try to charge me that fee of 75.00, I'm going to register a complaint with the BBB. I'm not going to say a word, just hang up and start the process. I'm tired of dealing with them. They are required to respond to BBB complaints by alleviating the problem or having it go against them. I've had good results with complaints in the past. What a horrible company. I don't know a single person who likes their service and pricing. Good news is...their days are numbered. As Clark Howard said...""The fat lady is already warming up and preparing to sing."" *No offense for using the f word, just a manner of speaking."
"Crystal of Spring, TX",4/16/2015,,"I transferred my services and the customer service rep started a new contract on my alarm system (so I was told) and added a phone line that I didn't ask for. When I called to cancel because the internet is slow and I found out I could get more channels with AT&T for a cheaper price, I was told I could't because it was a transfer (keep in mind I started a new contract that qualified me for the 30-day customer satisfaction) and my bill was $680. My bill for the previous month was only $180 and it was just paid. I still don't know how my bill went from $180 to $680 in 3 weeks. Because of my bill being past due (which I just made a payment 3 weeks before), no changes couldn't be made to my account at the time so I made the decision to just keep the alarm which I was under contract for and let go the rest of the services. When I called back after making a $260 payment on my account, I was told I was out of my 30-day agreement and I could not disconnect my other services. I never agreed to go under contract for the other services (I've had these services for over 2 years and I was never on contract so why I would I go on one now?). I'm being told my entire package is under contract and there's nothing they can do about it. I've been told 4 different stories by 4 different people and no one will honor what was said to me. At this point I don't want to give them another dime of my money...especially if they can't properly train their employees. The excuse I've been given is that the sales reps aren't familiar with the home product so they often give misinformation. My question is why are they allowed to sell a product they know nothing about??? I really hate Comcast and will never recommend anyone to do business with them."
"Danielle of Spokane, WA",4/16/2015,,"So I was surprised to see that when I went to pay my phone bill I had a negative balance. I checked the transactions and noticed Comcast had charged me twice!! I called ""customer service"" and spoke to a number of disinterested people in foreign countries who claimed there was only one charge. The next day I saw that they had taken money out of my account and applied it to next month's bill and credited the rest to my account WITHOUT my permission!! And there is no one to go to in this instance!"
"Jackie of Vancouver, WA",4/17/2015,,"We received a telemarketing call from a company representing the new Xfinity package from Comcast. They promised 2 years of all premium channels, hi-speed internet and a landline for less than we were paying for just cable (with HBO and Starz) and Hi-speed internet. They promised that we could hook all of the components up ourselves and that they would be shipped out that day. After about 10 days, we did get a box with 2 cable boxes (one DVR and one basic), and a modem. My husband installed everything according to the instructions and nothing happened. We called customer service and they scheduled a technician for 4 days later. The technician got the main TV working and we thought the bedroom TV worked, but it didn't. It just says it is connecting and no matter how many times you unplug or reset it, nothing changed. So, we called again and got another technician who got it working. 3 days later, the bedroom TV is still not connecting. I called on Wednesday and the earliest a tech is available is Saturday. There was a time when you could call Comcast and a person (local) would answer the phone. Their customer service was awesome. This is no longer the case. If you are lucky enough to get a person in the US, they never have any record of previous calls and never have solutions other than to schedule another tech. It hasn't been 30 days yet but I'm ready to chuck all their equipment through their front door."
"Kim of Fleming Island, FL",4/17/2015,,Constantly going dark or freezing. We end up doing your job on our end. You guys suck. Overpriced and under serviced. My heart goes out to customer service who tries to make it theirs. Not fair. You don't roll out a product unless itâ€™s trusted and true. All your customers deserve refunds.
"David of Atlanta, GA",4/18/2015,,"Basically I was the victim of a bait-and-switch by the XFINITY store at Delk and Powers Ferry during purchase of the XFINITY home security system. I was told verbally during the presentation that it would be cancelled without fee if I moved outside Comcast area. No contract was presented until installation. It was signed for me without my being present. A year later I had to move and was charged a large and exorbitant termination fee. Customer service has been non-existent as I have been lied to, hung up on and kept waiting numerous times without any of the under-trained reps able to even understand the problem, much less assist. Also numerous promises to return my calls were not kept. I will not ever deal with Comcast again and neither should you. Worst experience ever with any company. System is not worth the hassle."
"M. J. of Santa Fe, NM",4/18/2015,,"Comcast is demanding to speak with my dying mother before I can end my service with them. This is an all time low that a company would use such a deplorable tactic in a desperate attempt to keep a customer from terminating a contract. I just got off an excruciating call with ** (yeah, I'm sure she gave her real name when I asked). The purpose of my call was to alas end my service with this company that I believe is absolutely greedy and fraudulent, whose services are shoddy, and whose fees continue to escalate for no apparent reason. Throughout the conversation, ** used what sounded like a canned script, repeatedly stating that I am not authorized to make any changes to my Comcast account. Of course, I've made dozens of changes to upgrade my services, swap out equipment, etc. in the past. But now I am suddenly locked out in order to terminate the account. ** flat refused to let me speak to a manager and like a robot, simply kept repeating that I am not authorized on the account. This is a joint account with my mother. I have encountered this same problem a dozen times. My mom has repeatedly given Comcast permission for me to speak to them about the account. This is why I have been able to make so many changes to the account. Yet now, after asking to terminate the service, Comcast maintains that I am suddenly not authorized. I explained how many times my mother has authorized me to make changes to the account. But it fell on deaf ears. I explained that my mother is dying and in hospice care, and is simply in no condition to call Comcast. ** didn't seem to care. I found her to be curt, rude, cold, unprofessional, poorly trained, and completely stonewalling in her communication style. She said that mother is the only one who can make changes to my account. Needless to say, I am so absolutely done with this company, its incompetence, and its continued practice of gouging my bank account with excessive, ever increasing charges for the same poor service. I refuse to allow one more red cent of mine to go into their coffers. But they will not allow me to end my service without authorization from my dying mother. My mom can hardly talk, but I must now get a dying woman on the phone to fight with Comcast in order to end my service? Do the people who work for this company have any kind of human decency? I can see the company is cold as ice and doesn't give a ** about its customers, but isn't there one employee who can help me avoid putting my dying mother on the phone with them when I am, in fact, authorized on our account? I do not want my dying elderly and frail mother to feel even a fraction of what I've just been through with Comcast's horrific customer service reps like **. Please help!"
"matt of Braselton , GA",4/19/2015,,"Please do not utilize this service. They will promise great things to get you to sign up but no customer service after up to and including outright lies. I was with DirecTV, two HD DVR's, one other HD set top and one other normal definition set top. This was bundled with phone and internet at 6Mbs. The bill for this was at $130.00 roughly.I called xfinity/comcast and they quoted me $59/month for 50Mbs internet and phone. I specifically asked that I needed to keep certain channels (espn, amc, natgeo were among these). No mention of installation costs and confirmation that there was no contract but this price was good for two years. I received my first bill of $177. Since this day the nightmare they call customer service has not been able to resolve the billing issue. They insist that I signed up for the ""triple play"" at $89/month.Internet speed averages around 7Mbs. I have called their customer service and the CSR told me that they were having lots of issues with the cisco modem/router combo and that I would get better speeds if I bought my own router and modem. I did so ($250) but the speeds did not change. I called them once again and they sent a tech out 2 days later (two hours late for appointment). He said the signal from the curb to my house was ok, but signal to the area was bad. He stated that an engineer would be send out to correct it. Next day an automated call from comcast informed me the situation was fixed but I am still at 5-12 Mbs. This issue continues...Back to tv programming: at least 8 calls have been place to resolve programming. And at each call the situation with my programming gets worse. It even seems there may be some vindication happening as they reduced my service to the basic 30 channels (all crud btw) at midnight last night. When I call them today (Sunday) they say they cannot change service as their resolution center is closed.I am a consultant and am now going to be sending invoices at a charge rate of $300/hour for every hour I spent on the phone I am not billing to my customers. 4 hours today and counting. Now it seems they have put my box into deactivated mode. They insist that they cannot restore my channels without a 2-year agreement and $135/month billing rate. Do not do business with these people! Stay with Dish/DirecTV at all costs. The change will not be worth it."
"Abel of Miami, FL",4/19/2015,,"I was waiting for more than two months for new account and they haven't been able to connect the service. The customer service has no idea of how the company work. The subcontractor don't know the policies of the company, they told me to ask the neighborhood where is the box to make the connection to my house. Too bad, too really bad. They can cause a heart attack for sure. They come every week for almost two months for nothing."
"Danielle of Pittsburgh, PA",4/19/2015,,"I contacted Comcast in early April advising them that I wanted to cancel my cable services. Their customer service is horrible and not worth the $143.00/month I am paying them. The woman in the ""customer retention"" department advised me that she could increase my internet speed PLUS add HBO to the channels I ALREADY had, if only I wouldn't cancel, all for $79.99/month. I thought that was a great deal and agreed.A couple of days later, I turned on the TV only to find that almost ALL of the channels that I watch were gone. I called and was informed that I had been downgraded to BASIC cable plus HBO... I asked for a manager, the woman placed me on hold for 10 minutes at least saying she was waiting for a manager to respond. When the manager finally got on the line, he said he could give me back the channels I had before but I needed to pay more. I asked him to pull the RECORDED call and listen to the agent NOT tell me she was downgrading my cable, and to prove I was lied to in order to not cancel their services completely.I had also been informed that my new bill was roughly about $94.00/month including tax and just viewed my bill which is now $113.00... When I was speaking to the manager, he stated he would escalate my issue but did not tell me if that meant he was transferring my call, placing me on hold, calling me back, nothing; he said have a good day and hung up on me."
"James of Jensen Beach, FL",4/20/2015,,"I have a 2nd home in Florida which is a condominium and I am supposed to get cable TV through the association. I have picked up equipment for my unit and Comcast created a separate account. I have been trying to change my billing so that it is charged to the association, but I have been dropped by Comcast 3 times. The 1st time they transferred me, there was a recording that asked for my zip code. Not being a year around resident, I had to look it up. By the time I found my zip code, I was cut off. The 2nd time I was transferred, I accidentally hit the wrong key. There was no back button that I could use, so I was dropped again. The third time I got a hold of a representative, they hung up before I got my first sentence in. I spent an hour and 15 minutes, and nothing got accomplished.In these phone calls, Comcast had asked for my phone number and my last 4 of my SSN, so why do they have to ask for the zip code? Why do they cut you off, if you don't readily have your zip? Why did I have to wait so long to speak to a representative, only to have bad service? Why did they open a separate account when I told them that my association pays the cable? I'm extremely frustrated with this company."
"Michael of Sanjose, CA",4/23/2015,,"Got Comcast a few months back. Not only are they unable to provide the internet signal I am paying for - they give me the complete run around every time you call the support. The ""agents"" consistently switch me from one channel to the other and the result stays the same, the signal goes down 3-10 minutes for every 30 minutes of use. I have been switched between channels approximately 8 times now, I have also been sent to their store for a replacement modem/router and nothing helps. They now tell me that I need a service tech and that I may end up paying for the service tech even though their product never worked to begin with. Of course one of their ""agents"" told me that I could buy an insurance policy for $5 a month so I would not be charged for the service visit. You have got to be kidding me!!! This is the worst company I have ever done business with - it is a fraud, pure and simple. I am being charged for a product that doesn't work!! Fraud!!"
"Brittany of Memphis, TN",4/23/2015,,"My service was in installed at the above at the beginning of February and since it was installed there has not been a day that we have not experienced loss of service. On a daily basis we have loss of television from not being able to tune into the HD channels. No access to the guide guide. Cannot use the last program feature or having missing parts of recorded programs on the DVR. The Internet service is just as bad: speed lags, not being able to connect or it not connecting to the WI-Fi on devices. The phone service also drop calls, the user not being able to make a calls, (you can dial a number and the call never connects or it will go back to a dial tone), and when trying to make a call and never getting a dial tone.Towards the end of February me and a family member were hired for a work from home position, we needed to have installed a phone line with no features: no call waiting, caller ID or voice-mail. I was offered a fax line, which the representative explained is just a plan line, no features. I stressed to them that there should not be anything extra on the line BUT a private number, so that no one can get that number. He assured me that there were NO features added.I tested the line the day before the training end, (March 24th) and I find out that the number was not number that I was told was assigned to my account. I was originally given the phone number, **, (the number that I have now) but the representative insisted that the number began with **. I asked ONCE AGAIN, was there any features on my line and once again, I was told no. I took down that number added to my work information so that Avaya phone could pick up my line and THOUGHT that I was all set. On the day that I was to take test calls for my training, no calls were coming through. I asked my trainer for permission to call Comcast and was granted that. I called and was told that my number was the ** number. I said that I had been given a different number but the representative said that was the only number that was assigned to my account for that line. I asked once more were there any features on my line because I had became skeptical on what I was being told by Comcast staff, he said that he would call to me on that line, since I was calling him on it to prove that there were no features in it. He placed me on hold and called the line, it beeped. The call waiting was still on the line. He said that he would go into the line and again take the call waiting feature off. He assured me that everything was fine and that there will be no more problems with that line. He was wrong. As I began to take calls, the call waiting feature beeped in several times and that caused me to be suspended from working for two weeks. That caused me financial difficulties which led to the next problem.I had made a payment arrangement to pay my bill with my first pay check on March 30th. With me being suspended, there was going to be no way that I could have paid the bill. So I called the Collections department and I was told that there was no way that they could change the arrangement that I had made for the 13th of April. I called the Office of the President customer service and a representative told me that I would receive a call from someone in regards to this issue. On April 10th, a representative out of Nashville, TN called and I explained what had happened and I mentioned that if it had not been for Comcast not doing what was promised with the call waiting, I would had been able to honor my promise to pay, he agreed. We did a conference call to the Collections department and first spoke to a representative who said that the arrangements could not be changed, so the Executive Services rep asked to speak to his manager. The manager said the same thing that the rep had said but when the ExSvcs rep explained to him the situation, he agreed to allowed the dates to be changed for the billing amount to come out on the 24th of April instead of the 13th. After he had released the call to the Collections department, I told him about the service issues that I had been experiencing and I was advised to call the Tech Support so that they can assess the problem and maybe dispatch a call, which I did and the appointment was set for the 13th. I was also told during that call that credits for lost service will be given.On the 13th the tech came on time and thought that she had resolved the above mentioned issues but no. The same things that were going on prior to her coming are still happening. I did call her back on the same day, to inform her that we were still experiencing some issues but they stopped prior to her arrival so I called her and canceled the visit. That was a mistake. The services are still acting up, with me having to call daily. Plus, I called to inform billing about the outages and was supposedly given credit for the time for the service problems but I have not seen them reflected on my bill. The promise to pay situation is continuing with that check hitting my checking account every other day. It had caused over draft fees on my account. Plus, they are refusing to help me on this matter or my service issues now. I have asked to be let out of my contract but I was told that although I'm having so many issues that I could not be let out of it. There was a note placed in my account that I was asking for money from Comcast, I HAVE NEVER ASKED THAT, so now I can't get assistance with my issues.I have continually asked for help with the issues that have occurred since I have had this service and is not receiving any help, which have me thinking that I should start looking outside of Comcast for help because trying to get things right done right within your company is getting me no where and that is really pathetic. What I am asking for is:4 my account is taken out of â€œBlack ballâ€ status.If this is not possible, let me go to another company that can better service me because it's either Comcast feels that I am not worthy of their company or they simply do not care how they treat their customers. I refuse to believe that this multi-billion dollar can be that inept or hire a bunch of inept people."
"Elizabeth of Bennington, VT",4/23/2015,,"I am really surprise that Comcast never told me about rise the bill. That's foolish that I never heard the bill was 179 dollars! Without tell me no letter or no message, etc! Rip off!!"
"Janet of Cape Coral, FL",4/23/2015,,"I called to disconnect my telephone and put the internet on seasonal hold. I was giving them about 10 days notice. My call to them was cut off just was we were finalizing the order. I was unable to get steady telephone service and the internet was not working. I finally got through to them again. I spoke with 10 different people, was disconnected 5 times and it only started working when the last rep cancelled my order for seasonal hold. I can't believe that a company that provides telephone service has such a terrible telephone customer support system. No one can call you back, they have to disconnect you in order to test the internet, etc. Any ideas for alternates in the SW Florida area?"
"jackie of Ringgold, GA",4/23/2015,,"We had Comcast for a year and we're told the only thing we were under contract with was our home security. When we cancelled our cable, Internet and phone service, I was on the phone for 2 hours while they transferred me around trying to figure out how to cancel everything but the security since I didn't want to pay a termination fee. Finally, the rep stated ""I cancelled your current contract and just did another contract on the security"". This added several months to my previous contract term. I asked the rep how he could do that without my consent. I didn't agree to an extended contract. The rep advised me it's no big deal, he does it all the time. I just logged on to pay my bill and instead of owing $49 for my monthly security, I owe $290 because they state they misapplied a payment. What??? Now I have to spend another hour or so on the phone trying to straighten this out. I am also consulting an attorney regarding the ""new"" contract I have been put under and will probably file a complaint with the FTC. Stay away from Comcast! They are horrible. Of course if you like spending hours of your time on the phone trying to straighten out issues, being lied to about discounts and your bill going up every month then you should certainly sign up with them. They can promise all this and more!"
"Rebecca of Weymouth, MA",4/23/2015,,"I am so frustrated. It's been over a week and I am still not fully connected. Here are my string of complaints: The sales representative only gave me 2 options to get my cable equipment, either spend $10 to receive it by mail or $80 to have a technician to install it. She did NOT mention that I could simply pick it up and get my cable hooked up right away. Oh, but of course, when I mentioned if I could get it faster, she said I could pay more for shipping to receive it the next day.The box came 5 days later with a set top box and two other smaller cable boxes (far too many). NOWHERE was the internet modem, which was most important part and the whole reason I'm stuck with Comcast in the first place (Sadly, Comcast monopolizes my area). I thought I had everything needed at first (the instruction manual is terrible), so I called to get the set top box activated. After a half hour of struggling with the sales representative, she told me that I needed to call the billing department to receive my services.Next day called customer service, surprise surprise, I didn't need to call the billing department. I also figured out through my own research that I needed that internet modem. Picked up the internet modem at the local Comcast store. Had to call 2 sales representatives to finally get it working. Then I find out that I need a splitter in order to use the same cable outlet for both internet and TV.Go to the local Comcast store AGAIN to pick up the splitter. Returned the extra little cable box I was sent (What a waste of packaging when I could've had that internet modem instead). Everything is hooked up and I call to set up the cable. Robot sends me to a sales representative and guess what? THE SET TOP BOX DOESN'T WORK. Looks like yet another trip to the Comcast store. I mean really, is it so hard to pack up the right things and make sure everything works? I want my $10 spent for shipping, this is ridiculous. I would never recommend Comcast to anyone EVER."
"Lori of Savannah, GA",4/23/2015,,"I purchased the preferred package with Comcast May of 2014. I decided that the rates and customer service was lacking, so in January 2015 I contacted Comcast stating that I was going to discontinue my services. They offered me a 12 month promotional package for 89.99 while on the phone, then after I received my bill the next month, the bundle was 99.99. I called and they stated there was no documentation but they would go ahead and give me the 99.99 promotional rate. Then April's bill came in and it was the same issue all over again. The bill was $20 more and after calling, they stated they have no documentation that I had called or spoken to anyone in January or February and refused to credit me the $20. The only solution they offered was to only give the 99.99 rate for 24 months and 109.00 for 12 months. So distasteful and absolutely horrible customer service. What has happened to make this company believe they do not have to listen to customers?"
"Tanya of Washington, DC",4/24/2015,,"I have been a Comcast customer since 2011. A couple of days ago Comcast inexplicably disconnected my internet services. When I contacted customer support, I was initially transferred between multiple departments. Finally, one representative told me that there was service outage in my area, that technicians were working on the problem, and that I would be re-connected at 7:30pm that evening. This did not happen.Concerned because I had several papers due and needed the internet for research purposes, I contacted Comcast's customer services a second time. This time was told that my account had been deactivated and that in order to reactivate it, I would need to purchase wifi services ($39.99) and a self-installation kit ($9.95). I was told that I could either travel to a local service center or wait 3-5 business days for a kit to be mailed. I chose to wait for the kit to be mailed because I did not have time to travel to the service center.Because I needed internet service to complete work for school, I ended up using my cellular hotspot for several days while waiting for the self-installation kit. Charges for the additional data totaled nearly $100. When I finally received the self-installation kit, I opened it to find two coaxial cables, a bag of cable tacks, and a splitter. Although I had been told that the kit would contain an activation code, there was no such code in the kit. I did not know what to do with the items I did receive so, once again, I contacted Comcast's customer support.The first representative I spoke with was unable to help me and told me that my account was in ""inactive mode."" He then transferred me to another department. The second Comcast representative I spoke with was also unable to help but told me that he had ""escalated my issue to upper management."" He then transferred me to another department. Finally, the third representative I spoke with was able to reconnect my internet. At no point were any of the items in the self-installation kit used.Worst of all, no one bothered to mention that Comcast might have a wifi hotspot in my area that I could use while I was waiting to be reconnected. I only found out that this option was available after a friend mentioned it while I was chatting with the Comcast representative who was finally able to reconnect me. Obviously, by that time this was a moot point. This entire process was exhausting and completely uncoordinated. Each representative I spoke with asked me to list the same information and apparently Comcast kept no record kept of the issue because I also had to describe my problem each time. At no point was I given an explanation for why my service had been disconnected."
"ileana of Hollywood, FL",4/24/2015,,Customer Service poor knowledge of their services. Don't give out the right information. I have been dealing with the same issue for over three months now and still giving me a new ticket to try to solve the problem. What is going on with them?
"Jessica of Norcross, GA",4/24/2015,,"The worst experience ever. It's a shame I was paying for the $60 a month bundle with basic TV and internet. When I realized the basic channels were only about 10-15 channels I called to inquire about an upgrade which I was told was going to be a special $99 a month. I look at my account, one month I am being charged $150, next month $120. Hmmm all for one TV and a modem seems pretty odd when I was specifically told $99 a month. I have spoken with 6 different people in the past hour. Had to use a different phone because every time I called from my cell phone and they see the number that is linked for my account I am connected to an account representative then hung up on. Called from a different phone and BAM was able to connect! One customer representative informed me I was only trying to receive free services and once I was appalled he would say something like that. I told him the situation and he hung up on me. LOL. Go figure. Comcast hires only professionals with customer guaranteed satisfaction, correct? Smh awful business. How are they even still operating??? Complete scams, ripping people off, for basic channels and slow internet! Once my lease ends, I am never using Comcast again."
"SUDARSAN of Houston, TX",4/24/2015,,"Be aware of Comcast direct sales people offering deals. You will be surprised when you see Comcast monthly bill. It will not be even close that to deal offered by the sales person. I contacted customer service two times to resolve this but to my surprise I lost internet signals both time, now I have complaint to FCC. Now I have to wait and see. Please ask the direct sales person to put everything in writing. When I call the sales person the call goes directly to voice mailbox. No response to my email from the sales person."
"James of Miami, FL",4/24/2015,,"Lies, broken promises, overbilling, sit on hold to be hung up on after hours, nothing corrected properly sums up a few of my experiences with Comcast. Most recently, I returned my router thru UPS as I was told to save ten dollars a month. Instead, my bill went up 15 dollars and I was hung up on after an hour when I called. This is one my 30 miserable experiences with the worst rated company in the history of America (an actual fact, google it). Solve my problems now!!! Starting bill was $99.55, most current month $167.43 sums it up."
"robert of Quincy, MA",4/24/2015,,"My business relationship with Comcast began June of 2014. I had recently moved into a rooming house with multiple cable hookups and wanted to get internet access. Since they are the only provider in the area I called their ""customer service"" number. I was told that I could easily go to the local office to pick up a self install kit to get up and running. So off I drove to the address they provided and upon entering discovered that I was given the address of their local marketing office! No worries, they gave me the correct address and I proceeded down the road to pick up my easy self install kit. Got to the office-great service, got home, and hooked up my computer to the cable in my room. My computer was online, but my neighboring roommate lost his cable service. Apparently the line that was installed in my room was actually his, so called ""customer service"" and set up an appt to have a tech to install (costing me more $$$). Success! Internet was installed and all was well... but in March 2015 received a call from a Comcast telemarketer offering me cable tv service added to my internet for only 5.00 more a month! Good deal so I said why not, she proceeded to send me an easy self install kit. Upon receipt, realized that with the way my cable was set up I could not self install. Did not want to pay for another tech to come out, so within 3 days took a trip to my local Comcast office and was assured that I would not be charged for the cable TV and my acct would return to the previous billing. Surprise! First week of April received a bill from Comcast. For the months prior to the telemarketing offer I was paying about $52.00 for internet service (overpriced in my opinion, but my only option). The bill was for $105.00!!! Called the customer service # and spoke to a nice guy who said he could credit me $10.00 for the cable tv self install kit, but I would have to talk to a representative in special relations to resolve the rest. He did agree that I should not be charged double for the same service. After being on hold for several minutes special relations rep told me that although I was offered a 30 day money back guarantee by the telemarketer, and I did cancel the cable TV service within 3 days, the offer I signed up for 9 months previous did not exist anymore! After going around in circles with her for several minutes she said she could sign me up for an ""economy"" internet plan for the same price I was paying previously (approx $52.00 with rented modem). She recommended that I pay my bill $95.00 (after the generous $10.00 credit!) and all would be resolved in my next billing period. So I checked out my acct online last week, and guess what??? I am still signed up for a cable TV and internet bundle for $105.00 month!!! I cannot deal with the telephone customer service"" people anymore, so will return to my local Comcast office to cancel everything asap. People should not be treated this way!!!"
"Joseph of Rockledge, PA",4/25/2015,,"I generally had satisfactory experience with Comcast up until I moved from my apartment to my house in 11/14. I did have an issue with a piece of equipment that was returned through certified mail yet I was charged for the equipment monthly until I moved then I was charged for unreturned equipment. Several tickets and calls led to nowhere so I had given up on it. When I made the move in November to my house I had already set up with Mover-edge to transfer in October. While still in my apartment in October I realized that the Mover-edge didn't use my shut off and start date and instead canceled my current account and generated a new account ""Unknown to me until late"". So I called to turn back on the first account until November. When I moved in to my home I was hit with a past due/ shut off notice one week into moving in, I was overpaid on the first account yet somehow a second account existed that ran at the same time. I paid the 250 dollar shut off notice bill and kept it moving along. I eventually cut the services down to the bare minimum in December. Then I got a notice stating I had another piece of equipment on my account ""The same equipment that was returned over two years ago and also had to pay a unreturned fee."" At this point I had enough. I contacted Verizon and had them come out to install their service in late January and I had Comcast set up to cancel in January I was told that the money from the first account would be paid in a check to me and I returned all of the existing equipment.February comes by and I receive a 30 dollar bill from Comcast that I was more than happy to pay assuming this was the last bill. In March I receive a bill notice for 79 dollars I check my account and I am still a consumer of Comcast somehow. Between 6-10 separate calls from 2/20/15-4/25/15 to cancel service have been unsuccessful. I have been told I would be contacted by management three times. I was promised back pay and also the amount taken from the previous account. Yet another month rolls by and I still have to pay the Comcast bill in order to avoid them from sending it to collections, although I was told not to worry about it and don't pay by two different Comcast employees. I can't even trust them not to bill me nonetheless not send a past due to collections because they said it was ok. I am in the hole for several hundred dollars from unreturned equipment fees that I have receipts for or certified mail receipts for with also paying late fees on bills that shouldn't have existed along with paying for a service I haven't even had the equipment for in over four months."
"tanner of Heber, UT",4/26/2015,,"Literally garbage. Can't keep a connection going for more than I'd say 45 minutes MAX. I've never been so discontent with any kind of phone, tv or internet service in my life and I grew up using dial up. Don't get this whatever you do. Straight trash."
"Barb of Spanaway, WA",4/26/2015,,"We have basic cable thru Comcast. We pay $83.00 a month for this service so we can have a wireless TV and Computers. At least three to four times a month we have the speed of: Bing 97, Download .81Mbps and Upload of 1.36 Mbps. When called, you are on hold (with the worst music) forever. When they do come on the line they try to overwhelm you with their technical knowledge. (Speak English, I am not impressed!) I just want what I am paying for. How do we get what we are paying for?"
"margie of St. Leonard, MD",4/27/2015,,Over the past year I have received the worse service from Comcast in the 10+ years I've been a loyal customer. The issue I originally called about has not yet been resolved because the rep either hangs up on me when they can't fix the problem or the rep just gives up and emails me information so I can read and fix myself. As soon as I can find a company that provides high-speed internet and cable TV I will take my business elsewhere.
"Lynn of Renton, WA",4/27/2015,,"We are in the process of finding new service. Comcast has become so unbearable. The customer services is so bad that it is just painful to call them. We are tired of the spotty cable service, bursty internet speed and a home phone that will drop calls whenever it wants. We have spent months trying to clear up our service issues, last Sunday when we called, they said that there was NO notes on our account regarding our service issues. If we have problems, we should have called them. I was told that there is no way to remove notes from the system and that I should not be asking for refunds for services that I ""say"" I'm not receiving. We have never even been late with a bill, for over 20 years we have been loyal to Comcast, but that have not been loyal to us. I can't wait to call and tell them to rip this crap out of my house and make way for new provider. We just don't know who that will be yet. We are mad as heck that we have to go through this change. We refuse to pay a full bill for partial service."
"Amy of Clinton Twp, MI",4/27/2015,,I cancelled HBO back in Jan and apparently customer service cancelled it off my cable but not off the internet so I didn't realize I was being charged for the past 4 months. That was my second call to them to cancel it and I thought it was all set. I didn't double check my bill and that's my fault but I saw it was cancelled on the cable box and never checked the internet HBO because I didn't ever watch it on the internet and would never have thought that the rep would have to take it off both places. This needs to be fixed.Why does the rep need to go into 2 spots to cancel a service. The rep I talked to today said she would take it off the past 2 bills and that's all they could do. She saw I had other credits on past bills so she implied the other 2 months I was overcharged was fine since I had other credits. I had other credits because my service was screwed up and I had to spend literally hours on the phone to correct it. When she saw I had credits she didn't care to do more and said she would take the $15 off. I had to ask if she meant the $15 for the two months and she said yes. So I will still have to go back in and check to see if she actually does take off the charges for both months.
"Johnny of Olive Branch, MS",4/27/2015,,"Had the displeasure of having to contact customer service today. After past experiences you know you probably should take some headache medicine before calling. The picture on my tv was having problems and it had started last night and continued this morning. I called, after confirming your phone number, having you go thru all sorts of voice menus, entering the last 4 of your soc sec number etc etc. I got someone who I could barely understand. I had to go thru all the information that I had already verified on the automated menus again, last 4 of soc sec. etc .He then told me that my signal was fine and so they would need to schedule someone to come out and replace the cable box. He said if it was their problem it would be free, if not I'd have to pay. I then suggested I just take the box into the local office and swap it. He informed me that I'd be charged a $15 'welcome fee kit' charge. I asked him why I would be charged if I was returning defective equipment. All he could say was, ""I'm just telling you, you will have to pay."" I told him I could not dedicate a half of a day to stay at the house and wait on them to come. He then told me that was the best option or I would have to pay to swap the box at the local office. Then as usual they begin to ask you. ""Have I provided you with exceptional customer service? Are you happy that I resolved the issue?"" I simply hung up the phone. Called back a bit later, went thru all the voice message prompts and finally it switched over to a customer service rep who promptly hung up the phone as soon as they answered it. 3rd try now. Got a lady that constantly assured me, ""No Problem. I will take care of your issue,"" and then she is evidently going down a list of things to have you to do that's ridiculous. After wasting 10 mins doing these things I asked, ""can you just please send a reset signal to my box and see if that fixes it?"" She then said she had to check a few other things first. Then she said, ""ok I found the problem. Your area is experiencing a problem and it's already been reported so there is no problem with your equipment.""Three calls and almost 1 hour of my time to find out what should have been told to me on my first call at the very beginning. Apparently checking to see if there is trouble in the area is not at the top of their list when troubleshooting your problem. They need you to unplug the tv, unplug the box, change channels etc before checking for problems in your area. That should be the very first thing they do. This company is amazingly bad. If there was any other option that was an improvement I'd change in a heartbeat but I've heard they are all bad."
"will of Pittsburgh, PA",4/27/2015,,"My contract for DirecTV was up having been with them for 8 years...we trying to get away from long standing contracts. Called Comcast they said they no longer had contracts. I made sure they carried the stations that I watch such as Boomerang. Tech came outâ€¦but no Boomerang. The DVR worked in the living room but not in the bedroom. Called Comcastâ€¦they said they donâ€™t carry Boomerangâ€¦but they gave me HBO free. Donâ€™t care- we are not home enough to watch it or the 800 channels we do get. Tech been out three times because of DVR. DVR records half of programs- constant error messages, screen freezes- have to restart the box and on demand programs keeps saying â€œtry again laterâ€. Called Comcast they reset the boxes. Works for a few days and then stops. It keeps happening. Household got tired of it, called and wanted to cancel. The rep said I was under contract for two years...another lie. Paying for services that do not work. Service is bad. Customer service lies, long hold times. Next step- putting in complaint to FCC, BBB. Took screenshots of TV with error messages. I was lied to from the first phone call. At least the Internet works."
"Tenni of Hinseville , GA",4/27/2015,,"COMCAST THE WORST. First of all you get transferred to 30+ people to fix one problem cause no one wants to do their job. Secondly they charge you for every little thing they give you, 12 month packages give you a discount for going paperless but never actually send you any sort of mail or anything telling you your 12 month ""special"" has been up and done therefore charging you upwards to twice the amount of money! Then when you want to add new services they can't get right and then you incur MORE charges for services you do not want or need. I wish there were more providers out here in the middle of nowhere where we currently are."
"Scott of Chicago, IL",4/28/2015,,"I canceled Comcast Internet service when I was moving to a new state. I received two bills after I canceled service, the last one coming 5 weeks after service was canceled. I called Comcast to ensure that it was my final bill and the Comcast rep ensured me that it indeed was my final bill. I paid that amount and thought I was done with Comcast.About two weeks later I get a letter from a collection agency stating that I owe Comcast $73 and that I must pay $157 to the agency. I never received any bill or correspondence from Comcast and when I called to talk to them, Comcast stated that I had a credit of $85. The $ doesn't really bother me, but I am in escrow on a house and this account has knocked my credit score down over 100 points and will significantly affect my mortgage rate. I had nearly an 800 credit score and this thing has knocked me down to the 660's. I'm working to get it all straightened out, but it may not get worked out in time for my closing, if at all.Comcast Internet wasn't any good in the first place, but this ordeal has been a real thorn in my side for weeks now. It has been echoed on this site often, Comcast has a monopoly and truly does not care about service or what kind of damage they do caused by their clueless reps. If you research Comcast and still go with them, I've got no sympathy for you. It's better to go without than have to deal with them. "
"Tom of Neptune Beach, FL",4/28/2015,,Internet Service Intermittent Outages Daily Dec 2014 - April 2015 - I have called Comcast customer service several times a week for the last 4 months because of outages and I get the runaround. They have old technology in my neighborhood that they can't get parts for and so customers are left with poor or no service. No one knows what is going on to resolve this issue so at this point I have to look at alternatives like AT&T or cellular.
"Peter of Naples, FL",4/28/2015,,"I have used Comcast internet service for 15+ years, using a proxy email address at the IEEE so that my contacts see a consistent mail address irrespective of the ISP that I use. Last week I stopped getting mail. I received a message that I needed to switch from POP to IMAP and did so. No mail. I reset the account several times; received unfiltered mail for a day then it stopped. Tried logging into Comcast directly to see my mail and the time taken to log in was 10 minutes+. Today I have been 20 waiting 20 minutes to log into the mail server. In desperation I talked to their service line for an hour, half of it with a supervisor. They gave me a couple of ports to try and concluded that it was a Microsoft problem (I have used MS Outlook 2007 since it came out). I argued that that was ridiculous and their response was ""buy Outlook 2010 or 2013"". I am switching my mail service to Google and changing my proxy. Comcast's response time is intolerable for running a business, and their failure to deliver IMAP mail through Outlook is absurd."
"Donna of Allen Park, MI",4/28/2015,,"April of 2015 I ordered comcast internet. I was told I could hook up the modem myself and be charged 9.95. If they had to send out a tech they would charge me 39.99 (no charge if it's no fault of my own). Well, guess what? I could not get the modem to work. Comcast sent a tech to my home. The tech told me it would never have worked because comcast sent me a modem for the wrong region. He went back to his truck and switched modems and it worked. I called customer service and explained what happened. The gentleman told me someone would get back to me through an email. Week and a half no word.I called comcast back and spoke with a woman and explained my situation again. She said she seen the notes and asked if I could hold while she consulted a supervisor. I waited on the phone 45 minutes and someone came on the phone asking for all the information again. I told her I was on hold and that someone was helping me. She said they transferred me to her (the payment center). Again I had to explained all the information. By this point I have been on the phone an hour and a half trying to get my bill straightened out. Now, this woman transfers me once again. This time I asked for a supervisor so I don't keep getting pushed off on someone else. I explained what the tech had said about the modem. She said comcast didn't have modems for different region. Comcast can come get their stuff. Very poor customer service."
"Ryan of Bayville, NJ",4/28/2015,,"Comcast first of all raised my bill $20 a month without warning or a notice. And now they charge me $40 for a house call when the technician did absolutely nothing. No wires were installed, no new modem, NOTHING. The tech sat at my computer, in my computer chair and went to speednet.com to check the speed on my connection and left. Said my internet is working fine!!! Horrible service and after speaking with ** from customer service for over an hour there is nothing they can do.... ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! Since when do we charge the customer for something wrong with the service you offer to the customer!!! I wish I could go to Verizon but I can't because they do not service my area, so I am STUCK with CRAPPY COMCAST!!!"
"Sally of Muncie, IN",4/28/2015,,"New cable service installation was connected on March 10th. Installer told us that someone would be out to bury cable in backyard (from power pole to house) and close crawlspace under house where he pulled the connection from and it might take a couple weeks because of weather conditions. Called Customer Service on 4/10, 4/20 and 4/27, there are now at least two separate service requests on file and still no one out to bury the Comcast cable. The cable on top of ground is ugly and not safe, the crawlspace is open and house is exposed to rodents, etc. and lawn care provider can't properly mow the backyard. In addition to these problems, the yard is not safe and there is a trip hazard for anyone trying to navigate the backyard."
"Lisa of Bloomington , IN",4/28/2015,,"After Comcast lost some CBS shows (I don't know the details) I was suddenly not able to set up series recordings. OK but then I went through and set them up week by week. The recordings were dropped many times. Suddenly I couldn't rewind a show on WTTV. Couldn't pause a show, I did an online chat and then the ""person"" I was chatting with just stopped talking to me. Said I had left the room. I'm switching to AT&T. My parents are very happy with them. I can't get a hold of anyone local on the phone. This automated phone service is crap! I'm done!"
"Noel of Yulee, FL",4/29/2015,,"We have had little choice in our internet provider since we moved into our home. Sadly the only carrier is Comcast. Do not waste your money. We have been calling everyday since we got the service for sub par performance. For the amount we pay, we are supposed to receive UP TO 50 Mbps. We are lucky if we ever get 10. Currently as I write this, I am on hold waiting for a Comcast supervise again, and we getting a raging 0 Mbps and 0 upload while managing to somehow be on the net. Last week, we lost service for 3 days, no refund offered, we had someone ""working on the problem"" in our neighborhood. It magically worked for the weekend. The same time they were working on it out in front of my house, we had a tech come into our home and check out our connection, check the lines that were just installed, and everything is FINE. It's Comcast not providing what people are paying for. I am tired of fighting them, but what can I do? It's all our new neighborhood offers. If you plan on buying or building a house, reconsider if the only cable company in your neighborhood is Comcast. It's not worth the hassle."
"Joan of Bristol, PA",4/29/2015,,How do I contact the FCC to file a complaint? I'm totally sick of my bill being wrong and inept customer service. We pay our bill BEFORE the due date every month and this month we get charged for 3 extra outlets and a late fee of $9.50 on top of it. HORRIBLE people to deal with... it's like trying to piece together a puzzle when trying to get answers with folks that broken English. Please there has to be somebody out here to help us when dealing with this beast!
"tammy of Olympia, WA",4/29/2015,,I have never experienced the worst customer service in my life! I was connected to 3 different people only to find out that they needed to collect another $130 from me or I would be turned over to collections. I had my service transferred and paid up my account but they forgot to mention that I owed the remaining $130. I had 3 phone calls all to which they realized I was completely paid up. So frustrated! I'm going to buy out my contract and get the dish. I HATE Comcast!
"Melinda of Little Rock, AR",4/29/2015,,"I called in to upgrade my service to a different box and that's when I found out I had been being charged for some equipment that I never knew about. After researching I found out that a previous technician that had came to my house left equipment there. I had called to get a new box one day. Well, the tech that was supposed to come was running late and he sent another tech out. However when this tech came out he left two extra boxes at my house on my wall unit. Well I never looked for any extra equipment because when he left all I knew is that my cable was working so I didn't notice any extra equipment that was left. He brought this equipment into my home. All I know is he did what he was supposed to and left. The boxes were left unnoticed. However, he added those boxes that he left to my bill that were never hooked to anything in my home to get the monkey off of his back.After calling that day and the technician advised I had been getting billed for equipment I hadn't used much less knew it was in my house. So he advised not to worry they would get my account credited. After calling back concerning getting the account credited I received someone else on the line that told me this would have to be done in installments. So I asked how would it be credited and they advised over a two or three year time frame. So that's when I asked to speak with someone in management. She advised that ""We're not a bank so we're not about to credit you that money back all at once"" even though they've already been paid cash they should've never been paid whenever they billed me. The technician that showed up that shouldn't have that day should have been held responsible. Because I didn't come into Comcast to pick their equipment up this was left in my home and was never hooked to anything.So after speaking with her I was so furious I advised her she could cancel my service out. However, they kept it running until the end of January 2015. So now it's April and I have a bill collector calling my phone saying I owe them a 1000+. I advised them I only owed about 400 dollars and I was willing to pay what I owe. Well come to find out they had equipment still showing on my account and also that equipment that had been picked up that the technician had left. So I asked who in their right mind would pay for something they don't owe.I called Comcast this morning and told them this needed to be corrected because they sent a technician out to my home and he collected any and all equipment and I signed off on it. Now they're telling me, ""Oh well there's still 500 dollars worth of equipment out there."" She advised me it would take 15 days to try and get this handled. I asked her in the mean time what am I to tell these creditors that are threatening to put this bill on my credit. She advised they would handle it, but I've heard this before.I am very displeased with this service and the bill continuously would rise and they would always have some type of excuse why it raised. I wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy. I pay my bills and I try to stay in good credit standing with people I do business with. I just don't care to pay someone for something that I never owed and have been paying for it for years before it was realized. I believe in doing what's right and I feel that just because you have this huge Corporation doesn't mean you can treat people anyway that you want to. There's a God that sits high and looks low. :) Thanks for listening."
"Courtney of Royal Oak, MI",4/30/2015,,"If I could rate this company less than one star, I would. I have NEVER had such piss poor customer service and I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. And this is coming from a person who has worked nothing but customer service for the last 7 years... My first call was to set up service. I was on the phone for over an hour. I made it repetitively clear I just wanted the basic cable and internet bundle. Every 2 or 3 minutes the woman came back, told me the same redundant line ""I'm just trying to find the best package for you"". Not sure what's so hard about finding the bottom line cable and internet bundle. An hour later she assured me I had exactly what I asked for PLUS DVR for $85.99. My second experience was when the cable guy came and set up my cable, told me I did NOT get internet, and couldn't get my cable to work. He advised me to go into the service center and speak with someone in person. My third experience was at the customer service center when I found out that the woman I initially spoke with did not give me a cable/internet bundle for $85.99 but in fact signed me up for a $120.00 cable NO INTERNET service. The service center guy fixed her wrong doing, advised me to call and complain and have my first phone call pulled/listened to, and assured me I wasn't going to have a deposit. I actually saw the ""customer approved, no deposit required"" on his screen with my own eyes. So now my fourth experience was when a new guy came to set up my internet and fix my cable, which come to find out the first guy set it up wrong. This process took 3 weeks (remember, I still have no working cable or internet). I called to complain and have that phone call pulled and my price adjusted. I was told a supervisor would contact me within 24/48 hours. I never heard from anyone. I called again, was transferred 5 times before I could complain again, and again was told someone would respond within 7 days. Never heard from anyone. Now I have my first bill which showed a $150.00 deposit (the one the service center guy assured me I wouldn't have) a $30.00 charge for a modem that was supposedly shipped to me (this never happenedâ€¦ I had a modem the whole time and never needed one shipped, never asked for one, nor did they even ship me one on accident. I was just charged for this) and I was charged for the 3 weeks of service when I didn't have cable or internet because of Comcast's mistakes. So I called AGAIN, complained AGAIN, and AGAIN was told a supervisor would contact me that business day. I never heard from anyone. Yesterday I demanded to speak to a supervisor. The Customer Service Rep basically refused to let me speak to his supervisor after I clearly asked 2/3 times. I told him to either adjust my bill to my satisfaction or send someone to come pick up their equipment and I will call AT&T. Their response? ""We will remove all charges one full year after you first signed up for our service. Don't you worry Miss, one year of you having service with us we will be sure to remove all charges."" NOPE! Do NOT even bother with Comcast. Please, trust me."
"Tess of Chicago, IL",5/1/2015,,"Comcast Xfinity is the worst of the worst. Each time I need to call in about something, I constantly get the run-around: each person you talk to will each give you a completely different answer to the question you're asking. If you're not able to get your cable and Internet pricing lowered, hang up and call back to get someone else. It took me 6 different people to finally talk to someone who was able to give me a fair and cheap price for my service. When I have a technical problem and the person you start talking to sounds like an idiot, hang up. They probably are. You will end up wasting your time on this person only to have one of two things happen: 1. They hang up on you because they can't figure it out or 2. Will waste your time blabbing about everything you already told them was wrong and end up having to transfer you, in which your call gets dropped anyway. These people are terrible, this company is a joke. If AT&T services my building, you bet your butt I would switch to them. Ugh."
"Linda of Marysville, CA",5/1/2015,,"Check my Facebook post! It starts with, Comcast sucks! I've been trying to get my service fixed for 5 or 6 months now. I'm going to throw all of your damn equipment in the river. My phone service is static and unrecognizable, and my TV is just as bad."
"sudhir of Nashville Tn, TN",5/1/2015,,"I had a self installation kit sent to my place 3 days ago and installed and then called the customer care for activating the service. After trying out many times and through multiple agents, they could not do it over the phone and recommended to send a technician. Again messed up setting an appointment date which is inconvenient for me and after having no output via the call, was told that they'd escalate the issue and call me back today morning which am still waiting on. This means am basically without internet at my place for at least a week and God knows when I'll get a response."
"Araba of Orlando, FL",5/1/2015,,"I began my Comcast service in September when told after moving I could transfer the service to a roommate. I began then transfer process in November, calling the company and getting the correct paper work and sending it into the correct address. I informed them multiple times that I was going to be moving in December. After two months I realized that the transfer had not gone through, so I called them again in January only to be told that it would not be possible to transfer the service. Since I had been informed by a Comcast employee on numerous occasions that this would be possible I complained and was told that I would be able to cancel my account and waive the early termination fees. This was on February 2nd. Two months went by and on April 2nd I received a bill at my new address accompanied by a letter from a collections agency. It took me 3 calls to even get to the point where I was told that the bill was for the early termination fee, and they informed me that bills had been sent to my previous address (that I had informed them prior to my move I was leaving). I am livid as this bill, which Comcast already told me that I didn't owe, is going to be begin affecting my credit on May 5th, 2015. Eventually I spoke to someone in Customer Solutions that informed me that the refund had been applied to my account on April 2nd, 2014; however, it makes no sense to me that a refund would be applied to an account while simultaneously sending the bill to a collections agency. Comcast has repeatedly misguided and misinformed me to the point that I do not believe anything any customer service agent has told me. I've been told multiple times I do not owe this Early Termination fee and have acted in such a way to assume I don't. I don't know what to do at this point because I don't want it to affect my credit, but I know I do not owe them this money and their terrible customer service is just sending me in never-ending circles."
"Meridian of Centralia, WA",5/2/2015,,"I had two internet options available to me when I first moved here about 10 years ago; Qwest DSL and Comcast Cable. I had questions about both and so contacted both companies; I made my decision to go with Comcast based solely on one thing: it was easy to reach real people who spoke English with Comcast, while I never could figure out how to talk to a person at Qwest.Everything was fine for a few years, but then it started falling apart. My internet started disconnecting with increasing frequency, until it was happening several times an hour. I work two jobs from home, both of which require internet connection, so this was not only frustrating but also costly. I called customer service and they told me to get a new modem. I drove 100+ miles to the nearest Comcast store and got one. Problem solved... for about 9 months, when it started disconnecting several times an hour again.This time I noticed something... the disconnecting was only happening in the daytime on hot, sunny days. Obviously some connection somewhere was expanding with the heat and messing up the connection, or something. The correlation was so strong that I could predict what days I would have connection issues by looking at the weather forecast. I called Comcast to report my findings in the hope they'd be able to really fix the issue, and this was when I discovered customer service no longer spoke English very well. But, I was able to get someone out who fixed some connection in the ground that was shorting out. Internet worked great... until next summer.Since then, for the last 5 or 6 years, every summer is a constant battle. I can go weeks without having a full day of continual connection. I can't make the customer service reps understand my problem.... they just tell me to ""unplug the modem for 15 seconds or to get a new modem."" It is incredibly insulting to be sitting there on hold with your internet down while their stupid robot voice tells you to go online to check for outages. It's even more insulting when they try to get you to pay more for extra crap I don't want when what I already have doesn't work.I would switch to Qwest but my roommate has been battling with them for years too, though for different issues. The only other options around here are all dial-up (did you know they still even had dial-up?!) and that's just not good enough for my jobs. It's an incredibly frustrating situation and oh how I look forward to the day there is another option available... I'd even be willing to set aside my long-standing hatred of Google and try their service. It can't possibly be worse."
"Ginger of Cordova, TN",5/2/2015,,"Unbelievable! Tried to order the fight tonight on paper view but my balance was too high. Discovered, after holding for an hour, that someone in account billing had applied a returned check payment to my account, in an amount that I did not owe, plus an NSF fee. I talked to Customer Service, Customer Retention, Customer Service, and then they transferred me to Collections to get the charges removed. 1 hour and 20 minutes later my call was forwarded to a voicemail to leave a message. Called back and was disconnected numerous times. "
"lary of Fort Lauderdale, FL",5/2/2015,,Last month I tried to reduce my bill. I only use Comcast for internet and a landline but they told me I could add basic tv for $1.00 per month. This is a scam. I had no equipment and I didn't really want it but thought what's $1 more dollar. When I tried to discontinue they wanted to charge me a $250 penalty. Don't trust them.
"Autumn of Modesto, CA",5/2/2015,,"I rescheduled a move. Called in and rep changed the date for the new service. But they didn't change the date for my current residence. Got up super early to work.. and no phone, Internet or cable. Spent over 2 hours on the phone. Nothing resolved. They say I have to take my equipment to the Comcast store. They don't open for another hour. I was transferred and given numbers to call. Learn your job. I even called back yesterday to see if any other appts available. That rep didn't even catch it. They need better employees."
"why of Seltion, AZ",5/2/2015,,"This company is highway robbery! I had all services they offer TV, Internet, phone security. From the start the setup was a disaster. They came to my home to do and install and charged me 40 x 6 for all the wires they said they had to install in my home. When they came out they bought the wrong equipment. When I asked if they could return they told me I would be charged. Their customer service is horrible and they are most expensive service. After 7 days of service and on the phone with them everyday they credit only to apply the same charges the following month. They lied about everything free install etc... and charge me 1k early term fee because I canceled since they charge for every little things and have horrible Internet that keeps dropping in and out. I don't know how people allow this company to rip them off. Don't let them get Netflix and hull if you must and an antenna and leave these people alone!"
"T. of Fall City, WA",5/3/2015,,"I have been with Comcast for decades, at numerous locations. Their current customer service is completely absurd. I have had at least one issues per month for the last 6 months or so. I have never received more than a few dollars credit in total. I am soooo sick of having to deal with poor service. Tomorrow I'm going to look for another option. My patience has been completely exhausted. Stick a fork in me, I'm DONE!!!!!"
"Blake of Salt Lake City, UT",5/3/2015,,Was on hold for an hour to try and get my TV hooked up which I am paying for in order to watch the Spurs game but after 1 hr 40 minutes of being on hold and the game had ended I decided to just stop being on hold. 
"Jaye of Tacoma, WA",5/4/2015,,"About a month ago, I began having difficulty with my internet connection. So, I carried my laptop to a local coffee shop, and set up a connection there. Problem solved. Then, I called Comcast and spoke with a technician (in the Philippines). They sent out a technician to look at my Comcast equipment and connection. He informed me that the problem ""must be my computer, because the equipment seems to be fine."" So, I arranged with a professional technician to check my computer. It turns out that the problem was indeed with the Comcast box. The router part of the box was going bad. When I called Comcast again, they told me I would have to come pick up a new box myself and hook it up myself. So many problems, so much cost, so little service!"
"Shawnie of League City, TX",5/4/2015,,"Price was already not great to begin with when I start asking around what friends' and family comparable rates are. So I ask to lower, ""No, sorry"". Then without warning my ""bundle expires"" the next month. $180 for basic cable/internet? No."
"jason of Sugar Land, TX",5/4/2015,,"I've had Comcast for over a decade and have dealt with internet going out every single month, multiple times a month. I literally cannot count how many times they've came to our house, rewired everything, changed all the hardware, and the problem still persists. Comcast has shown by example that the problem is not the hardware or the wiring; the problem is Comcast. Over the course of 3 weeks I documented each time the internet stopped working, and I have the exact date and time for over 20 occasions when the internet went out, just within 3 weeks. Keep in mind, I was only able to document those times for when I was actually trying to use the internet. Who knows how many times it stopped working when I wasn't on the computer. I've grown tired of writing down how many times it goes out simply because it goes out way too much to keep on documenting it. To make matters worse, I'd say 70% of the time I talk to customer service or a rep comes out to the house, you can totally tell they hate their job and don't care about quality service. They just want to get in and get out so they can get their free pay check. There are a couple of hard workers, but most seem to care less and are all in a bad mood, which makes the situation worse when both parties are in a bad mood. I'd never recommend Comcast to anyone, and thank goodness I am young so I can do the world a service by voicing against Comcast for the next 70 years. I will do my best to take every opportunity I can to tell people EXACTLY what I think of Comcast. Oh one more thing -- outrageous prices. Don't even get me started on that!"
"Tanya of Davie, FL",5/5/2015,,This is my first time writing a review and I think it is important for people to know just how horrible Comcast is as a cable company. I hear the horror stories but never knew I would have one of my own. I relocated to a new condo over a month ago and requested for Comcast to disconnect and switch service to the new address. My online account never reflected the requested updated new address info and had a zero balance. I called and waited on customer service for 3 hours!!! Really? 3 hours??? When is this ever acceptable for any business! This is a shame and disgrace.I took several calls to find out my service was disconnect for $30. How can you make a payment on a $0 balance on your account. This company does not have the right to acquire Time Warner as a merge and the big monopoly of corporate should be limited so other competitors can be a part of the market. I know why people go to DirecTV... It makes sense now.
"Jen of Frederick, MD",5/5/2015,,"I was very ripped off by Comcast. I had DirecTV for over a year and half. Absolutely lovely experience great customer service and never was shocked by bill. I recently moved from an apartment to a town home and found out I have no line of sight for DirecTV blocked by trees... So I was forced to go through Comcast and they ripped me off... I paid on my internet yet they never credited a count - that was first strike. I was told my first bill would be 121.00. Well my first bill was 318 because of a bunch of hidden fees and cost not disclosed... I told them I will be paying the 121 the amount I signed up for and will be disputing the remainder in litigation... If you like throwing your money down the toilet being treated like crap and working with liars, then go with Comcast. I don't so I cancelled. There is nothing on TV worth the mental anguish and stress this company will put you through... If you like honest company who gives you good service I highly recommend DirecTV. I'd rather have no TV than work with Comcast... This company will rob you blind and nickel and dime you to death... Do not trust this company at all. If you do blame yourself coz you've been warned and informed!!! $$$$$$$$$$!!!"
"Sara of Portland, OR",5/6/2015,,"I ordered Blast internet, yet that professional grade of internet never worked in our home. We had three techs agree that it wasn't working and never follow through with fixing it. I called to troubleshoot multiple times and told that it was working even though speed tests proved otherwise. My complaints were never noted and so I could not get money back for the non-existent service. Furthermore, it took me 1 hour and 46 minutes to cancel my cable because, shockingly, the man on the phone could not figure out how to do it. Instead he kept saying, ""Please, I got you a great new deal. Just sign up for this because the cancellation is not working""."
"Sarah of Raymond, WA",5/6/2015,,"I have been dealing with issues regarding my services since installation. Comcast tells you one thing without follow through, and outsources technicians that are unfamiliar with their product. They lack customer services, and charge you for services you are unable to get. They are extremely unprofessional and in my opinion the WORST cable provider.. In my opinion this company is a fraud that will waste your time and steal your money."
"Rachel of Greenwood, MO",5/6/2015,,"I have unlimited calling as it is a part of my cable package but I keep getting billed for domestic calls. I've been calling them every month since November 2014. They credit the charge but then I get a new charge the next month. Each time they remove they swear it shouldn't be on there, the next month & it is."
"Yulia of Gardena, CA",5/6/2015,,"From top to bottom, Comcast has demonstrated how evil and disgusting a monstrous company can be. From the start, when Comcast scheduled an appointment, they did not show up or did not show up on time. When they came to the house, they didn't know what they were doing. I later found out they were ""just contractors"" Comcast hired to do the installation - they were ""not"" Comcast employees! Then when it came to billing, Comcast almost always made ""errors"", which took a lot of my energy and time to get them straightened out!All in all, Comcast is only good at one thing: raising my blood pressure and effectively reduce the quality of my life. So, word of advice: stay away from Comcast if you want to live a happy and low-stress life! Comcast is an example of incompetence mixed with GREED, made-in-China level of service, and ""we-are-too-big-to-care"" attitude. Comcast is what Hitler would be proud of as a company that represents his ideology: GREED+EVIL."
"Julian of Denver, CO",5/7/2015,,"I ordered Triple Play with COMCAST RESIDENTIAL (CR) on or about 3/16/2015 from ** in Colorado Springs and it has been painful since then. My internet and phone were initially with COMCAST BUSINESS (CB). CB was difficult to work with in transitioning phone and email addresses to the CR account. I really went through 15 different agents to get switched over, and after 36 hours the transition was finally made; however it appears that I am having to pay both CB and CR for 60 days until my ""termination"" from CB takes effect. This double pay does not make sense as both residential and business are under the primary company, Comcast.In my current CR account it shows my phone as ""awaiting activation"" but phones have been working in CB for several years and are still. Either they are waiting for the 60 days to be up or it seems like someone either can't flick the switch from CB to CR or won't. What can be done? Is there a time line apparent? It appears that over 500 people may have the same issue. Comcast only allows ""chat"" support. It is not possible to document an issue with email, and have a service representative respond. Chat services are long, enduring episodes that typically end with no resolve."
"lisa of Streamwood , IL",5/7/2015,,"4 hours... 11 associates and still cannot disconnect cable or come to a resolution as far as the billing. And if anyone wants to know why they get disconnected? It is easier for them to hang up on you than to say, ""I'm sorry, I gave you the wrong information."" I was actually just told that by a Comcast employee."
"Dee of League City, TX",5/8/2015,,"I relocated to League City Texas area 4-1-15. I ordered cable and Internet services from Comcast/Infinity. It was installed on 4-2-15. I received my first bill on 4-16-15. I paid $200 in full 4-22-15. Then I received a bill due 5-17-15. I called Comcast to exchange a box, and ask how much was my bill. Then I was told that I ordered a fight on 5-2-15 Sat. I never ordered the fight. Then I was told I ordered 2 other movies that I did not order. I ask for a supervisor and explained that I did not order those movies she stated that they were not removing them and that I had to pay for them.How do you fight a company like that when they just want to make money off of their customers? Don't care that it's possible that they made a mistake on their end. I am looking for a new cable company that service my area. It's not right for a company to do that to customer just because they can and get away with it. New to the Texas area and I have learned to do your research on companies before accepting their services. I would not ever recommend Comcast to anyone."
"kenneth of Lavergne, TN",5/8/2015,,"Bundle package I have changed when I received my new router/modem combo about a year ago. I called to report problem with my phone, even wanted to drop my phone service. I was paying for something I wasn't receiving. After several failed attempts through phone calls and being on the phone with Comcast being transferred over and over and usually giving up as I am very busy, I finally reached someone who took the time to fix my service. She said I also was only receiving 65% of my signal. She was very helpful and told me to call a specific department to be reimbursed for not receiving full service. I called the number, told my story and got the same runaround as before. I finally spoke with a supervisor who told me they could only credit me $45. I am very upset and dissatisfied. Especially when I am paying $30 a month for 10 months that I was not getting service. I want my money back!"
"monica of Tucson, AZ",5/8/2015,,"I spoke with Comcast 4/10, agreed to a new promotion. I repeated several times my total bill amount asking for confirmation that that is what it would be. The customer rep agreed several times. I received my bill today it is $100.00 more! I had been leery because of so many issues in the past. I called to discuss the billing discrepancy. I had the rep's name, employee #, and all facts written as stated to me, and one of the 2 people that were witness to my speaker phone conversation."
"Charles of Vancouver, WA",5/8/2015,,"I have had Comcast for 2 months. The first bill was 350 dollar for the 3 bundle. Was charged from when I call before set up 2 weeks later. Also the guy took 4 hr to put it in. Also they had the package wrong. Had to call in and have the turn on the movie channels and demand. Also had to call and get my DVR. Had to call and get bill straightened out and had to call a week later. Finally the guy got it and sent out the DVR but they sent one that was incorrect and had to get a tech out to replace it . Got and extra 70 dollars on my bill. They took off 157 and put on another 67. So my first bill was 194 then got my second bill for 212. Supposed to be 137. So called again and they took off 55 for the tech coming out but still had to pay the 212. But they said that my next bill will be 93 dollars for my next bill. So far totally dysfunctional on their services and they do not like to transfer to their boss because they don't have a clue on how to correct their issues. They gave me 30 dollars coupon for people per view. So what, get the bill right. The online bill never matches or reflects the bill in the mail."
"Richard of Minneapolis, MN",5/8/2015,,"I had cable services installed this morning. Within an hour after the technician left one of the cable boxes failed. I spent more than an hour on their tech support ""chat"" and repeatedly asked to actually talk with an agent. Finally I was able to talk to a tech support person by phone and spent nearly an hour and a half going through self diagnostics only to determine the cable box is defective. They are unable to send someone out with a replacement even when the box was defective within an hour of installation. I said they either could send someone out to replace the box or remove their equipment and I would cancel the service. Since my wife made the service arrangements, I was told I was not authorized to order a repair. She is out of town for several days and so I do not have service on one of my TVs for at least a week. This service sucks. My previous cable provider in another city has live agents to call 24/7 and would have sent someone out immediately. Forget Comcast if you have other options."
"Al of Davis, CA",5/8/2015,,"I called Comcast customer service (disservice) to complain about the fact my service rate had been increased $20, $20 and $40 for the past three years. I was transferred to a manger. She said that she was sorry for that and she could put me on a new plan which would reduce my rate, but I would need to switch my receiver box with the new version. And that she would also send me a free camera for my front door as a bonus. I told her that I do not want a security package for I already have a security system in my house. She said that this is a single camera and not a security system, plus it's free. I said thanks. Few days later, I received a box containing the new receiver box and remote. I never received any camera. I called them and asked about the camera. The agent did not know what I was talking about! Later I noticed that I was being charged more than what I was told. Few phone calls later, I am told that the extra charges were because I have home security package. I told them that I never ordered a security package and I never received any equipment for it anyway. The agent said that he will cancel the security package from my bill even though it was 3 days over the 30 day cancellation period. I just received my new bill. Lo and behold there is $220 early termination fee for the security system package which I never ordered or received any parts for. So I called again. The agent never let me talk to a supervisor. She kept repeating that because I had ordered the package I have to pay the early termination charges. She even acknowledged that there was a note from a prior conversation which agent had told me that they would waive those charges. But, now it is due to a supervisor to ""actually"" waive or not waive those charges! This is the worst company I have ever had to deal with. I believe it is their company policy to trick customers into different packages without explaining everything that they have planned to extract more money from you. This is not the first time. A similar thing had happened to me with them many years ago. By the way, I have had Comcast for over ten years. They don't care. I am so disgusted with corporate culture in America. Is there not a government agency that can put a stop to this systematic highway robbery?"
"Gregory of Missouri City, TX",5/8/2015,,"My cable/internet has been on the blink for over a month now and Comcast has sent 7 technicians over the past few weeks with each visit being the same - ""I can't fix it but I will send the guy who can."" I call customer service and they tell me they will get a technician out and I keep repeating the same thing that they have sent technicians and in my opinion they don't know what's wrong because it's not resolve. I have to go out to watch the playoffs because the sports channels say ""tuning error"". I truly have been patient but I'm growing tired of this. You can't talk to a supervisor, manager etc. Just in my opinion folks who are trained to say ""I am sorry for the inconvenience "" or ""I will send someone out "" - Waiting on the eighth visit and if no resolve I will cancel because I'm not gonna pay for what I don't use."
"Sergey of Madison, CT",5/8/2015,,"Year after year my family suffers from Comcast's awful service and it's getting worse. We have been trying to get through their automatic voice service after work hours but it hangs up on us every time! There is absolutely no way to talk to any representative after 7 pm. We tried to go on-line and requested for password change but unlike other companies they don't allow you to do so unless you call them! Another problem with Comcast is their cheating - they would increase your bill all of a sudden or do telemarketing with you promising free service and, if you agree, would add new service and charge you, and you would have a hard time to convince them you did not request any new paid service. I am sure if they would not survive fair competition if we had a choice to go elsewhere."
"Luz of North Plainfield, NJ",5/9/2015,,On my bill according to my services I am paying for internet speed of 50mbps when in reality I can't even watch YouTube video. When I go online and test the speed it shows only 12mbps. I am furious because they don't received a partial payment so I deserve a full service.
"Ben of Philadelphia, PA",5/9/2015,,Comcast would send out bills to me every other month and they would charge a late fee for the month in between that they don't. I'd call to complain; sometimes they would adjust the fee and other times they don't. You really need to review your bill and the charges Comcast puts on there. Shameful!!!
"Leo of Charlottesville, VA",5/10/2015,,"Comcast had gotten good reviews from our friends. So we gave it a try. The wifi worked well for a few months. With 3 iphone and 2 laptops using it, it did pretty well. After about 5 months it slowed way down. I truly noticed this when I was shopping for myself. Nothing would load up. It says that the wifi is connected with 5 bars. This wifi has so many problems. I wish I had known that before hand."
"Jack of Chicago, IL",5/10/2015,,I called comcast to turn on a box that was recently sent to me. Technical support tried to activate the box remotely and was unable. The technician on line offered to send a tech out at no charge to check my line or bring me another new box whichever was the problem. It turned out that the box that was sent out to me was not programmed so It would not activate automatically. When I got my bill I was surprised to find a charge for 39.95 on it for the service which was offered to me for free. When I called to complain about the charge all customer service would do was to give me half the money back that had been taken from me via fraud. I will be filing complains with the proper departments and cancelling my service asap. It seems that salespeople lying to customers is too often the norm at comcast. This is the second time I have had a problem with this company and there must be some federal agency that can give me a solution.
"Dianne of Dacula, GA",5/10/2015,,"This has been the most frustrating and time consuming venture I have ever encountered. I am just about ready to have you come and take all of the cable equipment out of this house. #1 I called and asked for the Blast Plus package. The woman told me that that no longer existed and it was now called Internet Plus. I asked about the channels and was told that it was only 29, but I specifically asked for a package that included Hallmark. She assured me that it did.#2 Installation. The gentleman was very nice but had a very hard time getting it set up. He had to call Comcast at least 4 times. The installation took over 4 hours! I was about to start charging him rent. As soon as he left we realized this was definitely NOT the requested package. TV consisted of ABC, NBC, CBS, Many Access Channels, Many ""sales"" channels, and cartoons. No Hallmark. All the boxes were $10 HD boxes. HBO was supposed to be included and that apparently was the ONLY HD channel in this package. Why would anyone pay for that package?We took all the equipment out of the house and took it back to Comcast in Snellville. A nice man checked the equipment in Snellville. We told him we wanted the Blast Plus and he set us up with a package. The Blast Plus includes Hallmark and Hallmark Movie channel, this did not. It also did not include HGTV and many other channels that the real Blast Plus does include. He did not add the 2 small boxes to the account. So we had one television working while being charged for 3. I called to complain and told the person all the hassle and hours that I had been on the phone. Trying to get through has caused many disconnects. Every time someone is routing a call they hang up. I have no less than 17 phone calls trying to get this service set up. After visiting Comcast store, the account was set up and the monthly payment showed up as $79.99. Blast Plus is $59.99 He sent me to Resolutions.Resolutions talked with me and checked all the notes. He agreed that I had been put through too much. I told him all I wanted was the Blast Plus as it was advertised. He told me that he would make it better. He did not give a package name but told me it would be 120 channels, Blast internet and would be $54.95 a month. I had him repeat it three times to be sure. This switch was still not handled correctly. We have three boxes and only 2 get all the channels promised. I asked the man to send me a confirmation to my GMail account. He sent it to the Comcast account which I do not use.We have three boxes and only 2 are getting the promised channels. I called to have a signal sent to the box that is not working correctly and was told that we have 105 channels and that HGTV and Travel are not part of the package. Funny the other two Boxes do get these and many more channels. He then transferred me to Resolutions 10:30 on Saturday Night. After many minutes of ""we are sorry, your call is very important to us"" I ended up hearing a recording that the Resolutions Dept was closed and to call back on Monday. Now I look at the confirmation that Resolutions sent to the wrong email address and it is over $100 per month. This whole case is ridiculous as are most of your policies. I was a client for over 7 years but seeing all the deals go to ""new"" customers only made me mad enough that I disconnected until I could come back in as a new customer. Faithful customers should not be treated like that. Particularly ANY person should not be lied to, not once, not twice but three times (so far). I do not have a working package. If this cannot be resolved to my liking, you can pick up all the equipment and I owe NOTHING $0.00."
"Kathleen of Albany, OR",5/10/2015,,"First of all, I just have internet service with Comcast; I discontinued TV service about 2 or 3 years ago. I called Comcast because they had a wire coming into house for my modem (I own) which did not have a boot for switching out wire lengths. Also on the exterior of my house there was no caulk around the wire so ants and other insects were getting in. About a week after the technician corrected the wire problem they sent me TV equipment which I did not order and Comcast told me I had to return it myself to a UPS service of their choice. My time my gas and I have disabilities.Now about 2 or 3 weeks later, I now have a blank screen popping up when I'm on the internet with just a title bar with ""Join Infinity"" and a lower bar with a web address and with just a blank screen, so you can only click the X or wait for it to disappear. This is only happening on my bedroom computer where Comcast wanted to put the TV service I DID NOT order. It is especially aggravating when I am streaming video on YouTube. Comcast pressured me so much about getting their TV service that at one point I said I'd think about it, but NEVER said yes, which should be on their recordings. I also called after that and said NO.I have called Comcast at least 5 times since the wire was repaired and I get people who can speak English, but don't seem to understand it. You have to constantly repeat yourself and then they connect you to the wrong departments. This is very unprofessional customer service and if there was another broadband provider in my area with good streaming and competitive pricing, I would definitely leave Comcast and I have been a loyal customer since the 80s when they were AT&T Broadband who also paid her bill on time. When I was down in Florida for a year in 2006, I got better service at a cheaper rate from the internet broadband provider for Tampa, FL. I believe their name was Bright House.In conclusion I feel I have gotten nowhere on all my calls to Comcast and am very frustrated. I have also noticed other people having similar issues posting on the internet. If I had better computer skills I would put up a website where people get together and file a class action lawsuit, because unfortunately I feel that is the only way to get Comcast corporate heads to listen. If you can pass this on to the FCC, I and probably many other people would appreciate it."
"Ryan of Pompano Beach, FL",5/11/2015,,"Comcast, a company only out to get money. I say this because I feel that this company, from since we started with them in 2013 has always over charged us, made us waste time waiting on them to come to our home to get service and even when we were going through hardships and couldn't pay the full bill, has no courtesy for us and didn't want to work with us. I spoke to a supervisor named **, he was so arrogant and came up with some solution to only give me service for one day and then had the guts to tell us that he is going to charge us 2 reconnection fees. I Was very frustrated with him and just decided to cut the service off completely. I dealt with this bs service for too long. I would never recommend this company to anyone, I will tell everyone to go with At&t and just avoid ever going to comcast. I Hate them with a passion."
"Tom of Malverne, NY",5/11/2015,,"Comcast is basically inept. As an owner of residential properties in South Florida, I have cause to subscribe to the internet for seasonal tenants. Comcast is not set up for this. What surprises me is that with as many rental property's that are in South Florida, you would think that they deal with situations such as this where there's policy and procedures. They can't get it right the first time ever. Last year I attempted to pay for the complete service in advance, and have the service turned off automatically. They can't do this. When you live in another city and attempt to resolve issues for your own account, they need your account number. There's no way to get it. Unless you have the account # you can't help yourself, and if you are not in S. Florida, you can't just pop into one of their offices and help yourself. It took me between 25 and 30 telephone hours last year only to wind up with a second account when the dust settled and I had to start over. This year, armed with the account number I attempted to pay over the telephone, and they got it wrong again. The details are too arduous to list here. I attempted to pay my tenants internet bill on the telephone and after asking the total amount owed for the entire length of the stay, they still got it wrong. It only took 56 minutes this time to get to a resolution, (We'll see) but I needed to acquiesce to paying a reinstallation of my TV service just to save having to get onto another department. This, even though I pay for the TV as part of my HOA maintenance fee. They never should have turned off my TV in the first place! I've never been late with my condo maintenance!! In the case of my internet commitment, I attempted to pay in full 3 days after I asked to have it shut down (BTW, they didn't do that either) and they were still billing me for the subsequent month of April!I thought all that I went through was possibly because I'm an imbecile, but last month at a gathering of 30 people up in Sebastian, FL, someone brought up the topic of the ineptitude of Comcast, and all hell broke loose. Everyone in attendance was attempting to top the prior complaining attendee with yet another tale of woe from their own past Comcast experiences. This actually made me feel better as it's an indication that Comcast is actually poorly run and it wasn't me!So, without other recourse in dealing with this monopoly, I can only attempt to warn others. When you speak to a Comcast employee, first ask for their name and company ID. For you see, if the call becomes too difficult for them they just drop you off the line and you will need to start over. Thanks to you who have read this. I hope that my comments help to preclude the loss of time patience and money of other unsuspecting Comcast consumer."
"barbara of Gurnee, IL",5/11/2015,,"My bill used to be due towards the end of each month. I have been a prompt paying Comcast customer for over 4 years now. Never had a late payment. Now I see that Comcast has changed their pymt due dates and these new dates were computer generated, as I imagine they were in the past also. My new payment date is now at the beginning of the month, which does not work well for me as I am on a limited income and only receive my pension in the middle of each month. That is when I set up their payment. I called and told them the problem and asked if they could kindly change my due date to towards of the month again. I was told no, can't be done. My payment is 76.00 so I figured I had grace period of at least a week, having done a little research on their grace period. So I would pay it on May 13 (it's due May 7).Today I double-checked the amt and was shocked to see I now owe 161.50. I called Comcast and asked, ""What gives? No grace period?"" Cs service lady said my grace period would be only 2 days since my bill was due 7th and the next bill is cut on the 10th. I asked her again if I could change the due date. No, not possible, she said but suggested I get ahead of the game and pay mid-month for the following month. I told her, yes I know that but this arrangement is not workable for me and I may need to look into at&t again. I am paying the 161.50 on the 13th, but this is totally ludicrous.I have never had a late pymt in all these yrs, now all of a sudden one late pymt that is unvoidable plus a really generous ""grace period"" of 2 days for a person with ltd income and still toes the line and pays their bills on time? Not willing to work at all with their customers... personally I cannot afford to ""pay my bill on time"" anymore if date is not changed. Is this a new way of collecting more late fees, etc?"
"P of Sacramento, CA",5/11/2015,,"They not only charge you fees that doesn't even apply to you, they also sign you up for things you never even asked for and says they did ask. No! It was a damn trick. I've been Comcast for 10 years now. Every year I have issues with them but just haven't found the time to shop around. They are either billing me fees that doesn't apply to me, or screwing up on my balances/credits and refuse to refund my own money. AND just a few months ago I REALLY thought I was on a Double Play for Internet/Cable plan ALL ALONG since I started because I've never changed or asked for anything different. Turns out the rep I spoke with when I called to make a payment, ""claimed"" I was being billed separately for cable and internet and that's why my bills kept going up. When I asked them why my bill went from only less than $100 to at least $150, they said it was because I was always late. Ok? I get being late and charged late fees or restoration fees but NOW knowing they changed my plan they claimed was no longer available to being billed separately now just pisses me off. The rep said she can put me on a plan that is lower, gives me free HBO, yadda yadda blah, and NOTHING WILL CHANGE. I said ""OK!"" Turns out I'm still paying about the same but they put me on a 2 YR AGREEMENT for the Triple Play which has phone service. Who needs phone service nowadays. Are they trying to rip me off more by charging all these phone fees then oops if I do utilize it and someone calls numbers that are chargeable I'm screwed again. I never asked for phone service or another 2 year agreement, now I'm sure if I cancel it I will charged more fees. Such crooks! Seriously! Either the company is just full of it or the hired a bunch of people who are liars and don't know how to do their job. Word of advice - STOP ripping people off!!!"
"Emma of Chicago, IL",5/11/2015,,Comcast is honestly the most awful company I've ever dealt with in my entire life. We have had some issues with on our demand and have spent 8-12 hours on the phone with Comcast reps. It's not the actual reps fault - it's Comcast! I have no idea how they think the current set up is working well! None of their reps are cross-trained therefore none of the reps are able to answer any questions at all outside of their expertise (not even sure that any really have an expertise). Not to mention we had to repeat the same information to the 6-7 reps we were transferred to even though we were promised these details would be included in the transferred. Comcast doesn't deserve the business they get... I hope some decent cable company comes along and puts them out of business.
"Olga of North Miami Beach, FL",5/12/2015,,I ordered service back in January. At the time I ordered it they told me that I only pay $39 for installation. I had installation guy came in and installed the product. Next month I got bill with installation fee of $39 which I agreed on and paid and next month I got another bill with another charge of $39. I was going back and forth with Comcast on phone. Just called them today and they give me good story that installation fee its only to call installation guy in just to come and look at you at your house! In order for him to install the product you need to pay additional money! THIS COMPANY IS VERY TRICKY AND WILL TRY TO RIP YOU OFF OUT OF NOWHERE. DON'T USE THEM. IT'S A BIG MISTAKE THAT I DID. INTERNET SERVICE HAS LOTS OF OUTAGE AND IT'S NOT STABLE! Waste of money!
"veronica of Miami, FL",5/12/2015,,"The reason why I am writing this letter, is to express my FRUSTRATION over all this years, with this COMCAST. Even though their service wasn't bad, customer service is the WORST area I have ever experienced in a company. After several years of service, having many problems with the billing department, on February 2015, I ended my relationship with COMCAST. I couldn't handle anymore, that each time I called, nothing got resolved, they hanged up the phone after long minutes, and in one occasion more than an hour, or transferring me to several departments, because no one ever gave me an answer to my problems. At last, I changed to another company, and after talking to several and multiple Comcast Customer Service Reps., I thought I had resolved the ""monthly payment issue"" (Comcast was still charging me service). After talking to the only nice Rep. that I thought was going to make me forget all the bad experiences with this company. I thought wrong. On March 2015, I received another bill, as if COMCAST was still my cable and internet service. I spoke again with someone that got everything resolved. And on May 2015, I receive a letter from collections, because I still owe COMCAST a month of service. I really don't know what to do. The amount that they expect me to pay, even if it was 20 dollars, I will not pay."
"roberto of Atlanta, GA",5/12/2015,,"Comcast sucks! I ordered a self install kit that could never be used, they knew it and send it anyway. I try to cancel my service but then I realize that they are a monopoly and I am their **. Once I need the service for my work and my wife work, I had to deal with their lame excuse for customer service. Long story short, got the kit April 12th, the prima donna technician will be here may 14th, let's see if he/she can make this thing work. Ooh!! They want me to pay a bill for a service that never worked, or they will send me to collections. I guess the people that work there are so tired of dealing with angry paying customers, that they have no choice in being **/idiots too.If I could write a list of the 3 worst things in humanity, it would be: Comcast, Ass cancer, Nazism. Don't get me wrong, once you get their service working, it can be of good quality. But the monopoly situation, the kickbacks they give to local franchise regulators, and their condescending way of treating their customers make the whole Comcast Experience a total nightmare. I wish the devil could offer cable service in my area, customer service would be better. Hopefully the tech guy will come and make things work, but I am not sure. They are usually either lazy or have bad attitude, and never show up to the appointment on time. I have no hopes that they will do the right thing, but I have to pay and see because I have no other choice. I could go on and on here, but I think you get the picture here. Good night, and if you can (not my case), kick Comcast in the ass and use other provider."
"k. k. of Plymouth, MN",5/12/2015,,"I am going to spare you all the rant, we know paying over $100 a month for TV is stupid. Comcast has gotten so much of the market, monopoly, that they can charge each home outrageous monthly fees and be so NON customer focused. A salesperson called me to talk about a great deal they could provide me for only $10 more a month. In the end I was going to stay with only internet and paying more a month because I now used up my plan and that plan was no longer available. The really unconcerned customer service person said ""Ok do you want me to cut off your internet today then?"" I said ""In one week you can"". Horrible company."
"Anony of Martinez, GA",5/13/2015,,"Let me start that on 5/9/15 me and my wife paid a deposit AND took care of a past due acct and decided to go with Comcast even though we had an active cable service with a competitor already connected. Sunday cable tech ran new lines to the house and left, NO signal from the new line, no internet all day, called 5 times and they assured me that MON. we would have service, guess what - NO service on Monday. Come to find out it was an open ticket for 8am to 8 pm. I lost my cool and they bumped me up to an ""escalated"" ticket for Tuesday. Guess what here it is Tuesday and NO tech no internet, I have called again at 5 more times and they said now they had me on an open ticket for all day... AGAIN! Now here it is going into Wed and I have an automated msg stating that I will have a service visit on Wed. from 1-3 pm. Let's see if this happens...I am SO frustrated at this whole ordeal, I don't even HAVE service and paid for it. The outsourcing aggravates me and every time I call I get some Indian csr with an English name like ** that has NO Clue to what's going on unless he reads my notations on my account which has been nothing but call after call after call waiting for a tech to activate my line for internet. I feel so stupid for disconnecting the other provider and it was ALREADY connected and running to my domicile!Here's what I learned, IF new cable has to be ran... that's what you get - ONE guy runs the cable, later a tech checks and activates the line on another date. NO MATTER how much or how many times you call, they will say anything to get you out of their hair, ANYTHING! The best thing to do is stay on the line as long as possible with them and hang up when done... why? Because every CSR is rated on how fast they get you done, that accounts for a Bonus, the longer you're on the lower their score, that lowers their bonus. Comcast service on the field sucks and this is before I actually have service with them JUST for internet."
"Lynn of Houston , TX",5/13/2015,,"Every single month for over a year I have had to call and refute unfair and (often times) unclear charges. I was always subject to contradictory and conflicting information from different representatives within the time period of the same phone call. For example, I signed up for a fixed rate of (about $120) for 12 months.. The first month's bill was $130, and as a result, had to spend about 20 minutes complaining to them that they messed up.. I ended up paying them anyway, then this happened for another two months.. (The second month was $140, the third was $154) and I called the 2nd and third month FURIOUS.The third phone call I spoke to a representative who told me that $120/month plan had already expired. I told him I was locked into that rate for a year.. Where after getting frustrated with me, he transferred me to another representative who told me that the first guy was completely wrong and that they were charging me for premium channels that I didn't have!!! After telling them that that is their mistake, not mine, they refused to take responsibility but did remove the unjustified charges from my account.Well that ordeal was a couple months ago, but literally I have had to call every single month to Comcast, just to refute the bill. Today I had enough and finally cancelled service once and for all. Please, NO ONE else should have to fall for their trap any longer! Tell your friends! Tell your social media friends and followers about them!! #NoCash2Comcast"
"Linda of Littleton, CO",5/13/2015,,"I reiterated over and over again the cost and fees associated with our new contract when I renewed. I know from past experience that Comcast will say one thing and when the bill is received it says another. Well we went from $129 to $169 monthly fee and they charged for the new equipment. In our initial conversation I repeated over and over ""there is no charge for the DVR?"" I was told ""no."" Well yes there was! I asked them to access the ""recorded"" conversation! Yeah right. Bait and switch! Switching to DirecTV."
"rob of Granger, IN",5/14/2015,,"The internet I pay for is awful. I pay a premium for what should be a premium service (blast internet speeds -- 50 Mbps), and don't receive anything close to acceptable. Comcast internet is an absolute scam."
"katrysh of Taylor, MI",5/14/2015,,"Comcast is not to be trusted. They're nice when you sign up but once that promotion end, your bill sky high - all kind of hidden charges appear. Customer service rep rude and very unprofessional... Contact CEO Brian Roberts, nothing was done... ** Comcast, I will be contacting my lawyer asap..."
"J of Sorrento, FL",5/14/2015,,"I have had service with COMCAST for 1 year and from the beginning my bill has fluctuated up and down. I told them that all I wish to have was internet service only and each time they would charge for TV and internet. In March this year (2015) I cancelled my service, they said they would refund me my payment. It now has been 10 weeks and still no refund. And they say it was mailed out but they will have to wait to see if it has been cashed. When I first had it installed they made me wait 3 weeks to install underground the wiring and I could not cut my lawn. I informed them that if it was not installed within the next week they could take all 300 feet off my property."
"Robin of Lansing, MI",5/14/2015,,"This place is horrible. Never go here! You cancel a payment and they take money anyways, in fact a day early. The internet is slow, the cable cut out often. Horrible non-English speaking customer service reps. It is ridiculous how they handle situations. I have never been happy with the company. FYI AT&T is the way to go!"
"Arlene of San Rafael, CA",5/14/2015,,"One hand does not know what the other is doing. C/s is rude and condescending as well as patronizing...... This is over 20 years of their 'service'. I must have their product because of the area that I live in. The charges are out of sight - and for what?? As I keep telling them, their exorbitant, ridiculous charges are way too costly. Their is no program for the seniors, disabled, long time customers, nothing. We're just paying for air = air waves. Their entire system is disgusting.... bad service repair people - I need a book to write the bad reviews and the stars should have a 'minus' behind them."
"DICK of Longmont, CO",5/15/2015,,"Very very slow service on weekends, holidays and after local schools let out. Comcast has badly oversold its capacity to serve its customers."
"Mike of Port Republic, MD",5/15/2015,,"Had connection problems and Comcast sent out tech 2 times never fixed, also never got any feedback. This all started happening when my 2 year contract was up and I was on a month to month charge. Called and got on a new contract and problems seem to have gone away. Sure hope this is not how they are running their business. But who are you going to get for service."
"John of Fort Myers , FL",5/15/2015,,I am at home from work for the third time this week to get connection service and no one has showed up again!! I'm not even a customer yet and I hate this company. I just called CenturyLink to come out here. They have cost me six hours of pay this week.
"Jay of North Miami, FL",5/15/2015,,"I got fed up with Uverse's charges for service earlier this year. I called Comcast for their regular internet service, no cable, no phone, no bundle, no contract... Cool.... Done... As soon as it was hooked up, the internet service was spotty... on again, off again. Not happy. After a month of having Comcast, I called to complain. Service person arrived, problem solved. Another month later, I called to upgrade the internet speed.... it was done. But while on that call, the sales person told me I could get ""Triple Play"" for only $10 more per month. I specifically told this person that I didn't want ANY contract! It was taken care of... My total package with TriplePlay was supposed to be $99/month. With tax, I figured another $8 to $10. Bill comes in the next month (April) and I see a bill that in no way reflects a $99 package. The bill is for $129 for that month. No way I'm paying that. I tell them ""I am sorry, but I never hooked up cable tv... I want to return the equipment and cancel this TriplePlay deal."" Then I am told there will be a $230 ""early termination"" charge from my ""2-year contract"".To anyone who might consider getting Comcast, please be warned.... it's taken me over 12 phone calls over the past 3-4 weeks... I'd say a total of 5-7 hours of time wasted, and according to the rep I last spoke to, the problem has been resolved. But first, they have bill me the $230 and then credit it back to me 48-hours later. The saga continues... Whenever you speak to anyone at Comcast, be STRONGLY advised to get not only the rep's name, but his/her operator # AND the confirmation number of your call. If they say that a supervisor gave them the ok to do something, get the supervisors name too!!!So far as I am concerned Comcast is engaging in predatory sales practices. They claimed they had a recording of me telling them I accepted the 2-yr contract. I defied them to get a copy of this recording me.... Of course, there was no recording, and nobody ever got back to me. They are beastly and as soon as this problem is resolved, and I have a credit for the ""early termination"" fee, I am moving my service back to Uverse or someone else. I would heartily recommend avoiding Comcast unless you feel like spending countless hours on the phone.... And if you do have Comcast, and you do have a problem TAKE GOOD NOTES.... Only your persistence will get them to do anything."
"Daniel of Marietta, GA",5/16/2015,,"My wife spent three hours on the phone for them to fix our internet. It took them 3 hours to figure out we are on the slow internet service. Now the internet cuts out, wifi doesn't work. Technician came out and put a new cable on the ground, everything was working, now the internet cuts out again. My wife waited all day on Saturday for the technician to come out. When the technician replace the cable, he said everything was okay. I am NOT happy with Comcast and will change over when a better service shows up."
"Kristin of Anoka, MN",5/16/2015,,I paid my last Comcast bill back in April. Then they sent a debt collector saying I didn't pay my bill. I contacted them and they said I didn't pay it even though it was reflected on my bank statement.
"Pam & Dennis of Benton Harbor, MI",5/16/2015,,"Can you train all of your employees the same? I got 3 different stories from 3 different people. I rec'd a letter stating I needed to upgrade a modem, sent for it and was then told I didn't need it, just send it back. Also, your website is awful. It won't let me shop when you are advertising a bundle for triple play. You seem to think you have us backed into a corner and we have nowhere else to go. You are soooo wrong. The costs go up and up and the service goes down and down. You have spread yourselves too thin."
"Marilynn of Willits, CA",5/17/2015,,"Trying to contact Comcast (again!) about invoice questions as well as equipment failure. As usual I get the automated run-around and hang-up after punching in phone number and zip code repeatedly while stuck in an endless loop taking me back to the main menu... until I get cut off. This pathetic company deserves a flaming pitchfork, not a star! (After writing this scathing review I can expect a saccharine email assuring me that they want to make it all right. I'm waiting, Comcast....)"
"Amy of Baltimore, MD",5/17/2015,,"I am writing this as the Comcast truck pulls up to my place for the third time in 22 days. I started my service at the end of April. Since then I have one of two TV's working and almost didn't get on this site because my internet is so slow it won't log me on to sites or shuts me down. Since I moved in I have made approximately 10 or 12 calls to Comcast, one which I with some remorse admit meant screaming at a supervisor. Each time I am promised that someone will investigate it; notes are being writing; supervisors will be informed; tickets are being written so the outside work that the guy on April 1st said was needed was going to passed along... at yet here I am May 17th with the same problem. What is equally pathetic is I was sent a bill and told I had to pay it and later, once the repairs are made they will credit my account for the services that were unavailable.I guess they think that a. I believe anything they say and b. I just climbed out from under a rock. I am new to Comcast. For 16 years I had a very, uncomplicated relation with Verizon. I live in an area where Comcast has a contract with the city so no one else can compete. Seems to me that used to call that a business monopoly back in the day and it was outlawed. So the guy here is doing the exact same thing the other one did... looking at my TV, looking out front, looking out back, looking in the basement, etc. Once he, like everyone else, determines he can't fix the problem I am supposed to have him call his 'person' and we are to have a conference call so I can get names, numbers, and verbal account of what the next thing to be done and a date in which I should, ha ha, expect it to be done. Bottom line if I didn't need internet for work, or could find another way to get it, I would toss Comcast out the proverbial door. I am furious; I have never had to deal with such liars, such incompetency, and a company that does not care about the consumer one bit.Well surprise surprise the technician just left telling me the same thing... that some underground lines need to be put in. I spoke to the 'acting' supervisor who told me Comcast doesn't do that, but sends it to another company so who knows if a ticket was written, if this phantom company will ever do it, and sadly this is news to me and means one more hoop to go through and probably not have anything good come from it [why think positively after 22 days of this nonsense].That is all I need to write. Comcast is a company that should have been shut down and/or fined years ago. I should be reimbursed not only for my lack of service, but for my time having to spend three days sitting around for 2-3 hours, and my emotional distress being lied to and having people say they will follow-up with me and don't. Nothing like feeling a total sense of not having any control. Thanks Comcast for making my moving to a new place more annoying than necessary."
"Rollene of Woods Cross, UT",5/17/2015,,"I've even with Comcast for 42 years & always paid my bills on time. Presently, I'm under contract with Comcast for the Xfinity bundle, until May 21. In January, my bill went up $49. I've called several depts. trying clarifying this increase & lower my bill. They said it was for equipment & nothing could be done to help me. Finally, this week, I've decided to TOTALLY drop Comcast, but Comcast Cancellation Dept. told me I couldn't cancel them until the actual contract termination date, even when asked to do that on May 21! I use to be able to negotiate with them, but not now! I'm so frustrated HAVING to do business with a company that NEVER hears or values an existing customer. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
"Peggy of Arlington Hts, IL",5/17/2015,,"We have had Comcast 3 days. All 3 services, phone, internet & TV out. I called and they can not get a tech here for 4 days. They have no emergency workers!"
"April of Milan, MI",5/17/2015,,I called Comcast Customer service because my services were out again. I spoke with ** first. FOUND OUT SHE LIED ABT NAME. She did not want to do her job so she sent me into a Spanish speaking prompt. I speak English. ** finally picked up the phone in the Spanish department and was angry with me bc he had to speak English. He finally sent a refresh signal to my bow. After 30 mins. Then was angry because I said he should not be making excuses for his co-workers. He then went into my account and removed my boxes from Comcast system. All of this was explained to me by ** a supervisor in the x1 dept. This company is a joke when it comes to customer service. Billing I don't even know where to start with that department. I am moving my services to another company. Beware.
"John of Baltimore, MD",5/18/2015,,"Really, Comcast? You are going to charge me $5 more per month because you had to process my new customer request, all because your website wouldn't accept my valid social security number? You guys are running a scam. No wonder everyone hates you."
"Todd of Oakhurst, CA",5/18/2015,,"A year ago I was attracted by their promise to bill $59 a month for internet and TV, but skeptical. Never got to experience that agreement. If you are late in prepaying your monthly installment they will call you up to 7 times in one day. Evidently forgetting your demands to no longer call you. Never seen anything like it."
"Marcus of Hayward, CA",5/18/2015,,"Just over a year ago, I initiated a chat session with Comcast as I had questions regarding their Xfinity Home service. The initial tech explained the service and options and at that point mentioned that there would be an $399 installation charge plus the cost of any additional equipment beyond the package I selected. After he explained all of that to me, I told him that the installation charge was too much. He mentioned that he could probably get the primary installation charge (399.00) waived so I continued to pursue based on that. I let him know what I was interested in getting and he ran down all the cost, and then told me that if I would go with the package that we just talked about, he would waive the installation. I agreed to that package based on this. At one I asked what the fee would be to cancel the service and he said the early termination fee would be $150.00. Note that I talked to two different people that day. ** was my initial contact and ** was the sales person once the order was nailed down. After attaching to **, I confirmed again about the primary installation charge and he did confirm that they would be waived. After I received my first bill, I did notice that they started billing me for the installation so I called and chatted with them several times regarding it with no resolution. I must say that I actually have a copy of the complete chat and have proof in it what I was promised. I faxed that to them and the last response I received was someone calling me telling me that what I was promised in the chat doesn't matter, because when I signed the paperwork that the tech had when they showed up is what I agreed to. I think this is tacky at the least."
"Dorothy of Irwin, Other",5/18/2015,,They have been over charging me for the past six months. I called in March 2015 and talked to ** and I thought it was resolved. I received my May bill and it has not been resolved. And they can not help me because I need to talk to A BILLING SUPERVISOR and they would not let me do so. I need to talk to a supervisor.
"Susan of Tallahassee, FL",5/18/2015,,"I wish I had read these reviews before I got Comcast but I thought that most angry reviews must just be people that can't be pleased. I mean how could a company stay in business if they are horrible. Well, these reviews are 100% accurate. I need not even type my complaints as they are all stated in the other reviews here. Also, I just got off of a customer service ""chat"" that lasted over an hour and a half! Liars, thieves, con artists, all accurate. I do think that I managed to get the best excuse of all though. It would be funny if I just heard this story and it didn't happen to me. I have had certain channels since I ordered my service. A few channels I am very particular about and would never, ever order service if I didn't get those channels. Since January I have had those channels. Had the original installer out who installed service, checked my package with my channels and everything was right. Two weeks ago I lost all of my channels except the major networks and public access, installer sent out who switched the box verified my channels and I was good to go. The next week (last week) I lost my channels, AGAIN. But this time the ""customer service"" rep, who should be renamed customer DISservice rep, told me that I never should have had those channels and that it was because of a ""CABLE LEAK"" that had been corrected so I should only get the major networks and public access. Now, I have heard a lot of BS in my time on this planet but I am pretty sure a ""cable leak"" wins the prize for most unbelievable. I hate liars and unless you do like liars and being lied to, do not get Comcast! If you do, get every detail sent to you in writing, record calls, screen shot chats, etc. This chat I did screen shot, so I have hard proof of the ridiculous ""Cable Leak"" excuse given by the representative but still don't have my channels, lost a lot of my evening dealing with lying representatives who were reading from some book of canned responses for customer service reps in other countries. I wish there was less than one star ratings. : ( Very disgruntled customer. Wish a news station would do an expose on Comcast!"
"Hugh of Charleston, SC",5/19/2015,,Do not use Comcast if you have any other choice - they are the worst company in the US and I hate giving them a one star rating. Recently moved into a new home and it took over three months to get the lines buried. They only came to bury it after service was lost due the cable being driven on. I have now been without service for two weeks due to line cut from utility work. The service dept is inept and and impossible to contact. I have called daily spending an average time of an hour on the phone setting up a repair appointment and no one has come to repair the line. Stay far away from this company.
"Lauren of Crofton, MD",5/19/2015,,"We had Comcast services for a total of 1.5 years. For the first part of that we only had internet at our old address, we moved and decided to take Comcast internet with us and add the TV service (what a mistake!). They messed up out move in EVERY way possible. They canceled the service 3 weeks early at our original address and sent the new equipment to the original address when they should have sent it to the new address. This totally messed up my bill and left me with 2 accounts! It took hours and hours of ME on the phone telling THEM how to fix this mistake since they had no idea how to fix it. The service at our new house has been TERRIBLE. Internet and TV working appropriately at the same time has happened maybe a handful of times. I have received so many credits from them since they were not providing me with what I was paying for. They have screwed up so many things. Customer service has NO IDEA what they are doing. They refused to give me for a missed appointment credit even though I saved proof of every convo I had with them and showed them the appointment was missed. I am SO happy to be switching to Verizon next week. When I canceled my service they said ""we see you have not had appropriate working service for a while, we can give you 2 months free."" Not even for free service would I stay with Comcast."
"Jim of Houston, TX",5/20/2015,,"ComCast is worst company in America. ComCast treat customer dirt, I am a ComCast Customer from last 8 years. I moved my office from one Suite to another Suite in the same building. I told the Customer Service Con artist **. and explained her That I want the exact Same Service and same rates Just moving the service to different suite. She told Me, ""I am sending you exact same items, just sign the Move/change order and I will move your services."" When I received my new bill I was $54.90 per month Extra form my previous bills. Now I am paying $30 extra for same internet Speed, $10 extra for same phone line, $14.90 extra For TV which I even donâ€™t have a TV in my office. Total $54.90 per month for the exact same service. I called back to @ComCast customer service and gentleman Was very rude. That person not suppose to be in customer Service. Instead of helping me he try to harass me That ""You already signed the 3 year contract and we screw you. You have to pay that amount because ** was successful in screwing you by signing those papers from you. If you go with AT&T we will sue you for $8,064 for the term of contract."" Entire system at ComCast is messed up from Sales rep to customer service. I am Planning to port my phone # with AT&T and move with them. Same thing happened with me at my home service 4 year ago. I signup with Comcast. 2 Phone line and Broadband connection. After one year my phone bill went up. I called customer service and I explain them that now I want to sign up for new plan that I received in the mail and customer service people did not helped me Then I moved my services to AT&T Uverse."
"Chris of Boynton Beach, FL",5/20/2015,,"My wife and I decided that we were moving and that we needed to transfer our Comcast services to our new location. There really aren't many other internet/TV options. When we called to transfer our services, we were told that we could get a rate of $89.99/month for exactly the same services we currently had. When asked to set a date for installation, I suggested that we could take care of it ourselves, but was told that wasn't an option and that the installation was mandatory. There was no mention of any additional fee for the installation.When I received my first bill, it was over $300, including a $129.99 charge for our services and nearly $200 for installation. We called to clarify the bill and were told that the deal we'd agreed to (for $89.99/month) had expired, in spite of the fact that we'd agreed to it when it was in effect. After speaking to five different customer service representatives, we failed to come to a resolution except that they didn't feel inclined to honor their prior agreement, but that they might drop the rate to $109.99/month. We made no progress with the unannounced installation charge.Regardless of how this ends, Comcast's customer service has been absolutely atrocious and their tactics are shady, at best. If there were another reasonable choice for these services, I would be using it. This is also not the first time that I've had to fight with Comcast. Usually I wind up on the phone with them for hours once every six months or so. If you can avoid them, do."
"Cindy of Fort Myers , FL",5/20/2015,,"This company is the worst company ever. I wasted 7 weeks of my time to get service. The right hand doesn't know the left hand. I was told we can have service. We had service before and now I'm being told after 7 weeks and 7 days of lost pay from work told can't service our home. A tech came out, said line too far from box, need third party to come out. Schedule as he told me and then still no one came out after three calls and rescheduling of which someone was going to be coming out next Tuesday. I called them because I got confirmation and the fees were 110.00 more. Called 4 times. Last contact, was told order was cancelled. This company SUCKS with a capital S and I can't believe they are still in business even to the point we got a call them wanting us to tv too. How can a company run like this and service? They have no clue customer have rights, shouldn't of been lied to and they shouldn't of wasted my time for 7 weeks.I was told they kept putting orders in and canceling because they get paid by each order. They should pay me for 7 weeks of wasted time and I mean hours and hours on the phone. I will be sure to tell everyone of this company even to supervisor not knowing a clue how to read notes. Also they had open several accounts on our home."
"Norman of Denver, CO",5/20/2015,,"I have been with Comcast for twenty years and they have gotten worse in the years I have been with them. They tried to charge me for movies that I did not rent. I signed a contract for one amount of money and when I looked at my bill it was more. I tried to talk to them and get the bill straight, I got nowhere. What I don't understand is why my bill is one price one month and a different price the next month. I have not changed anything and I do not rent movies. The only thing I can think of is they will try and steal from you. AT&T got caught doing the same thing and Comcast is doing the same thing. Do they think the public is crazy or they just don't give a damn."
"D of Miami, FL",5/21/2015,,"My last two bills have been $158 and $190 for 50 mbps internet and basic cable plus latino package. YES, but the worst part is, I usually receive less than 10 mbps and sometimes a ridiculous reading of 1 or 2 mbps. I work from home and my internet disconnects at least FIVE times a day, impacting my productivity. I can't watch a Netflix movie entirely because I lost signal and I can't work wirelessly because the signal is ""schizophrenic."" Comcast sent an IT tech who did nothing but to unplug and plug my modem and tried to engage me in ""Personal Business"" asking me to let him ""do the job"" outside of Comcast...totally unacceptable.The worst part...I was charged $70 for that atrocity. I was given a partial credit on that. Another technician visited my place and told me that the service cannot be improved. I consulted my neighbors and they told me that their service is very poor. Comcast has been negligent to improve the service in my building but have collected based on a bad service. When I called about this situation, the representative suggested me that the only thing to do is to change my speed connection to 100 mbps and bundle my services. He offered it as a courtesy for the horrible services, but I only received more mislead. I was charged with this ""change in speed"" and my bill went from $130 to $155, and my DVR services were suspended. When I called to inquire about it they told me that the DVR would cost extra.In sum, I have been paying for an internet service of 50 mbps and I only receive 10 in average and sometimes as low as 1 mbps. COMCAST is aware of the situation but negligent to solve it. The building has a bad connectivity but they prefer to deal with each customer directly before solving the root of the problem. They charge money for a service they don't provide and they are negligent to solve it."
"Gabriel of Palmyra, VA",5/21/2015,,"So I bought my own modem because paying $10 a month to rent is a total waste for a $70 item. They took the $10 off charge the first month and then added it back on the next. I autopay and didn't look at my bill for 24 months. Then I see the charge, call them, confirm that on their records it states I own the modem. Ask for a refund and they say, ""Nope, you have 30 days to dispute."" They admit it was their fault, that they were stealing for 2 yrs. Lame."
"Evie of Sacramento, CA",5/21/2015,,"Husband bought Comcast internet last year during a promotion as a new customer. We were informed that our bill was going to be $43.99 a month for 12 months. First bill came in. I can't recall how much the bill was but it was way more than told. Called the rep, was told service fees and whatever else they had to tack on. So we paid the price. The monthly payment stayed the same for the next 7 months, then our bill started increasing slowly. It was increased by $2.84, no biggy for 3 months. The supposedly last month of our promotion went up to $51. We called and asked why our rate was increase? Rep said, ""The bill is half promotion and half regular bill."" Are you serious? I was so furious. Told husband to cancel. But apparently we're past the day to cancel? Total bs. So we paid bill. Rep told us that we can cancel our service the latest on May 20 for no service fees and won't be billed. So that day came. Husband try to cancel service. But was talked into their new promo. The promo was 80 channels, HBO for 12 months, no contract with 105 mbps internet for $69.99 + $10.00 for the modem a month. We were also told that the channels would include sports, kids shows, and home and cooking shows. I told him, ""No."" But he was excited for the ""supposedly money saving deal"" so he went ahead and purchased the promo.That was yesterday. Today we canceled the service. Why? As we were on the phone with a rep last night because our channels weren't showing a lot of shows, the rep informed us that we got the economy package and that has 25 channels only plus HBO channels (only 4 channels). Wtf! We asked, ""Why would the rep tell us we are getting 80 channels?"" She answered, ""IDK."" My husband ask if she can see who was the rep who talked to him and she told us she couldn't see any comments or the name of the rep. Total bs. However, she will leave notes for the next rep to see when we cancel. See, so she can see the notes but denying it. IDK Comcast does this to their customers. What happened to treating people the way you want to be treated? They must be collecting so much money up their ** that they don't give a ** anymore. ""It's a sad sad world we live in"" -- Master Jack."
"Cheryl of Tequesta, FL",5/21/2015,,"My phones and WiFi have been in and out for months. Had to wait all weekend without service for Comcast to send tech #** to check it out on 5/18/15. He did nothing! Said my service was fine, refused to even check modem which we have to reboot 2-3 times daily. Said it was pole issue - would forward work ticket, he didn't. Called Comcast again spoke to supervisor who assured me he would escalate my ticket and call me back. He never called and now I find out he never put work order in for Pole-Tech. Now the soonest a Pole-Tech can come is 8 days from now 5/28/15. I tried to email complaint to President of customer service, but my WiFi went out. Comcast has terrible equipment, terrible follow up. Stay away!"
"Elizabeth of Greeley, CO",5/22/2015,,"We've been customers of Xfinity for about 6-7 months now, with horrible service from the get go. We have high speed internet, of about 7 Mbps, or at least, we're supposed to have that speed. My internet disconnects or crawls through speed THOUSANDS of times a day. This is no exaggeration. In the last five minutes, my internet has cut out three times. We've called Comcast SEVEN times now, and had all sorts of different service attempts, to still have horrible internet.What's worse? Every time they've serviced us our internet has gotten LESS reliable and SLOWER. We're paying 60 dollars a month for service we can't even use, and to get responses from a company that doesn't care (to put it politely and mildly). Even worse? We're stuck in a town with only two horrible providers, one of which is Comcast. They know it, too, and manipulate you for every dime.I'm a college student, primarily online. Xfinity's HORRID internet service has glitched out on me several times, causing failed exams, homework assignments, and completely lost assignments altogether. I'm paying not only for bad internet service (if you even want to consider service that hardly works as SERVICE) but also for the stress and hair-pulling of trying to get work done online when I can't even stay connected for more than a couple of minutes. If there's anything that represents foul corporations that steal from their clients, it's Comcast. I'd definitely prefer a root canal, labor, or a car accident than to deal with Comcast again. We're switching, PERMANENTLY, this month."
"Ted of Patchogue, NY",5/22/2015,,I have trying to get a service for my business past two weeks and I just found out it will be another 3 weeks before they can do it. I can't get anyone on the phone who listens just to cancel. After 7 phone calls to customer service every single one of them puts me to a voice mail after I tell them not to do so. I just called Verizon FiOS and got my acct set up in 10 mins and getting my service set up in 3 days. I wish I called them before!
"lisa of Hebron, IN",5/23/2015,,"I had Comcast installed us a triple bundle on May 1st. It is now May 22nd and I am still arguing about the contract I signed. I have emailed the CEO Tom K and have received 10 emails and contacts from 10 different ""CUSTOMER SERVICE RESOLUTION SPECIALIST"". Are you serious? I asked 5 tv's be connected only 3 were for the first week. My DISH network remote actually controlled my tv, not their remote. Really, then I am told I need to problem solve for myself, by a technician trying to help me reprogram my remote. As the woman is going through the universal numbers for my tv, none of them are working, so I told the lad and she said, ""Well, they have to they are the ones we use"", then she tells me ""Wee, let's do this over again together"".WHAT, you're not talking to a child. Another one named ** may as well have told me I was lying when I told him of the contract I have he insists there is no promotion like I have... Hmmm as if I made this contract myself. seriously. I originally emailed Tom K. with a response from everyone except him. I order a pay per view event the day after installation, 47 minutes the ""Fight"" lost signal for and they had to send signal to my tv again... Seriously I previously had only internet, so I chose a triple bundle because of the offer extended to me. Now I have been charged for the internet at $66.95 from my checking account, yet my bill shows a $50.00 credit, for what, I don't know. 22 days after initial installation, I have no resolution to what my issues were. I am now going to seek reconnection for Dish network and Vonage phone service and I do expect Comcast to pay for any cost incurred for reinstallation.Why should I have to fax email or call any information to Comcast when I gave them the contract number and the representative's name? Why has my blood pressure been out the roof just dealing with these people? Why can't they honor their commitment to providing customer service period. I am so discouraged that I should have to now reconnect another service, ensure that I am off from work to have this service installed. I cannot tell you how the lack of training has so frustrated me. Worst experience I have ever had with a company. The 22 days and counting that they have taken off my time is seriously ridiculous.My advice to them is 1) grow your people, through proper training; 2) build your brand, by honoring your commitment to a minimum of quality service; 3) If you have a dispute resolution team, teach the resolution; 4) teach Integrity, and hire the right people for the right positions; and 5) teach Empathy. Would they be as frustrated if this were them in my position? And when you have to go through 10 people, when you emailed the CEO, without even an apology from him, because that is who I addressed the email, says a lot about the concern they have for your issues. I am over it. They have consumed more than enough of my time and my energy, trying to play phone tag and email tag because guess what I have a job too."
"James of Auburn, GA",5/23/2015,,"I have had Comcast for about a year and half. When they came hooked it up, it started the bill was suppose to be $89. And free connection. That was not correct. They charged me for the phone, the internet, and the cable. Plus when I called them they claim that they bill one month in advance. So I had to pay them in payments trying to get it caught up to. Well the whole time they were adding late charges and other fees. So I paid them in full $306. The next bill was for $189. I called them again. They said that I did not pay the total amount due. But that was a lie. Anyway I argued with them and got the bill down to $ 108. Still more than $89 that was agreed to at the beginning. Last month's bill jumped back up to $139. I paid it in full, don't know why it went back up. Just received this month's and it's up to $169. I'd like to know how they stay in business and what can be done to get my money back. Is this how they treat all of their customers or just the ones that didn't want a two year contract?"
"steve of San Mateo, CA",5/23/2015,,"I called Comcast regarding a service known as 'International Long Distance' that is added to my Xfinity voice service plan. I asked the agent if Europe was included in 'International'. Agent said 'International' meant I could only call within the United States. I asked should that not then be called 'Domestic Long Distance?' Agent said Domestic, in Comcast parlance, meant I could only call free within my own area code. I told agent that would generally be called 'Local.' Agent disputed my definitions of International versus Domestic versus Local. I asked agent if he had bought a ticket on an international flight, would he not be flying to somewhere outside of the United States? Agent could not reply. So she just kept repeating that International meant only within the United States. I was speechless..."
"Gary of Marysville, WA",5/24/2015,,"Moving from Washington State to the east coast, 1 week and 3 days later I lost all access to my email accounts. I was told this would continue for 30 days until a new address can be established. My job depends on these accounts and now no access. Talked to Comcast IT and he says he cannot get me access when the account is deactivated, asked how am I supposed to be activated when I'm in transit?? Says there is a problem on their end but can't fix it. I'm basically screwed and no job confirmation because of no email access! 3 other moves and never had a problem. IT just kept going around in circles with no results. Extremely upset about this and not getting any help from Comcast. Will not be using them again."
"Robert of Edgewood, MD",5/24/2015,,"Xfinity is absolutely the worst. Everything about this company is awful. The equipment is the worst, always fails, constant rebooting. I thought maybe just me? So I went to neighbors and friends all same experience. Customer service awful. On hold transferred 5 different people endless spiral. Internet not built to handle lots of devices. Just save your money and headache."
"Andrew of Strasburg, PA",5/26/2015,,"I am writing anyone and everyone I can till I get someone to call me off. Send someone out to get me cable tv at my apartment. Now they deleted my phone number when I call - no account. **.  I have been trying for two months now, get the run around."
"Bob of Fort Myers, FL",5/26/2015,,"Problem with my TV pixelating. About 25+ phone calls to Comcast located everywhere but in the United States. After no resolution of the problem and the exchange of 2 Xfinity cable boxes, the lack of customer service only got worse. The second cable box and remote I was given I took home and setup. The remote control would only work the volume... nothing else.I went to Comcast the next morning and was given a replacement remote I was assured would work correctly. Before I left Comcast, I put the batteries in it, looked up the code for the TV they have in their lobby, and tried out the remote. It would only control the volume. When I went back to the ""customer service"" girl who gave the remote and pointed that out to her, she replied ""Oh, that remote won't work with the box you have. Here's the right remote."" It is no wonder that Comcast has no customer service middle or upper management people you can talk to about poor service experiences. THEY JUST DON'T CARE!"
"Colin of Chicago, IL",5/26/2015,,"Comcast is single-handedly the worst Customer Support I have ever encountered. I don't even know where to begin in my laundry list of horrible interactions. Most recently, after the standard 20-45 minutes of wait and ""verification"" process which requires everything but a blood sample, I was informed that my last request of downgrading my cable service was denied. DENIED. Now, I am going back to AT&T. Not a great option, but better than dealing with this monstrosity of a monopoly ever again."
"Gary of Gallatin, TN",5/26/2015,,We have had Comcast services since last July and have had the worst experience imaginable. Our internet goes out numerous times every day and when this happens then our TV also is stuck on one channel and we are not able to obtain the guide or change channels. I have to constantly reboot the computer modem and sometimes also the TV cable box almost everyday of the week. We have had service techs out here many times since we began our services and made many phone call complaints but nothing is ever done to fix the problem.
"Carmen of Boynton Beach, AL",5/27/2015,,We have a $300 cable bill and called to lower it. I spent over an hour on the phone with them (after waiting on hold for 20 minutes). I finally agreed to a $99.00 double play. TV and internet. We got rid of the landline. We got our bill but no change! I called them to find out what happened and the billing lady says there was a mistake made and I have to go back to the sales team. I was fuming! On hold again for 20 minutes! They wouldn't honor the agreement!! I asked to talk to management and she said the only thing they could do is email the manager and she said she would make sure she called today. It never happened! They never called. The worst customer service ever!
"Kate of Bonita Springs, FL",5/27/2015,,"Comcast created a new account for us when we moved from one house to another. In the process, they deleted our old email addresses and have been unable to restore them. Starting on May 18, we have been calling and asking for this to be corrected. We keep being told that it will be taken care of, and that someone from the ""tier 2 email department"" will call us to confirm. This never happens, we've called repeatedly, and now, nine days later, we're on hold once more, being told we will be called within 7-10 business days, not the original 72 hours promised. There is never the opportunity to talk to anyone that can actually perform the action required. Horrible, horrible customer service."
"K. M. of Lake Orion, MI",5/27/2015,,"The cable running from the pole to our house shorted and was literally melting the sheathing of from where it connects. Obviously too hot to touch so used a pair of pliers to pull it from the house. Called in to Comcast and after being rerouted for 45 minutes, we finally get to a human being and explain the issue. They were very polite and state that they will schedule an emergency technician to come to investigate. Hours later and nobody shows up, so we call back and explain the situation to the next support rep. After another hour on the phone, they apologize and say that they promise to get someone out here asap. Additional hours pass and still no technician.. I call back in and this time demand to talk to a manager, who provides the same empty promises, and still no technician. This company has the worst customer service that I have ever experienced and I assume it is due to the fact that they are the only option in the area.... It is a monopoly... Someone needs to give them competition and then maybe they will understand that customer service should be a priority"
"Hyu of Baltimore, MD",5/28/2015,,"I had no problem while I was using the service. The problem started when I closed the account, because of inter-state move. When I closed the account and went to the service center to return the equipment, they asked me for a switch that I've never received. They charged me around $40 (don't remember the exact amount) which made me really angry. I demanded to talk to a manager who was not helpful at all. I ended up paying and forgot about it.A couple of years later, when I applied for a loan, the loan officer came up to me and told me that there was an unpaid bill to Comcast which went to collection agency. Seriously? Before I close my account, I made sure that there's no bill to pay and they let me close the account which I believe because they didn't have any problem with that. I did not get a single notice or explanation and honestly I think this is one of their business models - ripping off the customer for no reason. I will never ever use Comcast again. This is the largest scam company."
"Charlie of Happy Valley, OR",5/28/2015,,"Comcast is so terribly hard to get through and when you are able to spend the 5 minutes on the phone tree, they are not able to resolve the issue. My internet is drops and I am bumped offline and unable to use my smart tv or the cable in my house at random times. My laptop has to be hardwired into my printer to work..it is unbelievable. Frontier is at my office and if I do have a problem, they are easy to get a hold of and make it a priority to solve the issue if I have one..."
"joann of Broomfield, CO",5/28/2015,,"On May 14th Comcast cut a main wire that left us without cable or internet for a full day. Wasn't fixed till the following morning. Spoke to them that day and they ASSURED me I would be credited for that day. Got my bill, no surprise I was not credited. Had to call and they acted like they didn't know what I was talking about. I know what happened because it was on the news that they accidentally cut a main fiber wire. So the person I spoke with that day was just bs'ing me. REALLY COMCAST, are you that desperate to rob people? There were thousands of people without service that day, how much money did they make off thousands of people not having service that day? And why would you not credit the people for your screwup?"
"Mr. of Antioch, CA",5/28/2015,,"Tried five time to activate 2 new units. Only 1 has worked since 5-15-2015. Had to go to Brentwood, CA office. Told **, fat black female with attitude about lack of 3rd unit working. Was asked irrelevant question about HDMI as 4 TV's don't have HDMI & other equipment converts 480/720 signals to 1080. 6 TV's receive HDMI over the air. ** said info needed to solve problem. Quest is irrelevant unless extra services to be sold to get commission. Was told problem of 3rd unit solved. At home and 3rd unit problem is NOT SOLVED as of 12:03, 3rd unit still blinking. Complaint to be filed with CA consumer Affairs and FCC."
"Lindsey of Tallahassee, FL",5/28/2015,,"I called Comcast today in need of my businesses Static IP Address. I was connected to someone who requested my account number which I did not have so he took my business phone number and wanted to connect me with someone higher up since I couldn't provide the needed account info. As I was waiting to be connected the call failed so I called back. I was then connected with someone and told them the situation, the were so EXTREMELY rude...I was amazed at how rude someone could be so I politely asked to speak with a supervisor or manager which he denied my request 3 different times. Then told me that I was out of luck because I couldn't give him my account number. Then he told me that the first person I spoke to would be fired for giving me the Static IP Address, which he did not do...obviously I was calling back to get it. I told him that he wasn't and that he was just transferring me to someone who could help and he responded with ""well, that would be ME! And I am NOT giving you that information and I will NOT help you any more!!"" He was almost yelling.....How can someone like that work with customer service? If I had control over the office account I would not be using Comcast anymore...Nor will I use them for my home. I understand needing proper information but I do not expect to be treated in the way that I was."
"Vishwanath of San Jose, CA",5/28/2015,,"Based on the technical support recommendation I have upgrade to phone service on 03/28. I told to the rep that I am using Vonage and paying $25, he said for $18 you can add voice. I checked with the technical support, ""can I call to India?"" The answer was yes and he explained when you download the app and you are calling through internet, Comcast will not charge. Later last month before activating, I checked with the Billing representative and he said download ""XFINITY Connect"" and you can use this like Skype calling for which there is no charges. Now they have charged $261 for voice. Great injustice. I spoke to the Billing manager and he is not ready to listen to the past conversation I had with the rep. Begin the customer for 4.5 yrs. Comcast billing & technical rep has provided the wrong info for which client has to suffer. If the concerned person review the conversation I had and remove the $261, it will be appreciated."
"Donald of Covington, WA",5/29/2015,,"In April, 2014 I signed up with a Comcast door-to-door agent to replace my DirecTV with a Comcast Quad package which included TV, Internet, Telephone, and Home Security. In the contract the monthly charge was $128.95 for the 1st year, $149.94 for the 2nd yr. and $189.90 for yr. 3 and on. After about 5 months I noticed my credit card charge was already over $180 per month. After no resolution with Comcast, I contacted the WA State Attorney Generals office who then contacted Comcast with my complaint. After some discussions with a Comcast agent I was told I was actually being undercharged. I found out on my most recent bill I am now being charged $232 per month. Although I have been reasonably satisfied with the 4 services I signed up for, I am totally dissatisfied with this change in my monthly cost, and am now trying to find out how much I will be charged to cancel these 4 services."
"Diane of Snellville, GA",5/29/2015,,The internet service and phone service frequently went out. I requested help and was told a technician would come out and there would be no charge. It was discovered that the initial was incorrect and that we had a very poor signal due to a reversal of equipment that was placed in the box on the outside of our home. It was fixed on the second visit by the technician. Comcast charged $70 for a technical call and refused to reverse the charge until I called to cancel the service.
"Josh of Cupertino, CA",5/29/2015,,"You have to haggle to get the right billing. They can add random charges to your bill, such as ""HD fee"". Rude customer service. If there are 4 people, all 4 living in the same area, having the same package and same start date; they would still get different billing. It all depends on which rep you talk to or how good you are at haggling. People are being too generous here with the ""one star"" rating. This company deserves a 0 and public humiliation."
"Deborah of Philadelphia, PA",5/29/2015,,"I have been a Comcast customer since before they were Comcast. I moved into my apartment in Feb. of this year and after a week or so, ordered cable. It was fine so we decided to bundle for the $89.99 advertised price. We were told that the price didn't apply to us. Since then we have had trouble with the internet on several occasions. We were promised free HBO for our troubles as you know when I tried it was not available. Comcast acted like they knew nothing about it and like I was trying to add steal something from them. I am so done with Comcast. Looking for a new company asap."
"Chris of Oak Forest, IL",5/29/2015,,"Had Comcast (""CrookCast"") installed on 5/14/15... looked at my online acct. and it states that I am past due (just had this service for a few days..) then I get a bill a week later stating that we are about 3 hundred some odd days late and $150.00 needs to be paid immediately. WHAT! I just had this for about a week.. LATE! The nightmare has begun....5/16/15 - Called customer rep. and a supposed resolution specialist. I was told they will escalate this and have it resolved. I explained past due is not mine and needs to be credited. I am assured that they will take care and call me back today. 5/17 - Called back - never got call back yesterday.. so I called back and csr states that past due bill is from 2002 and 2010 - call disconnected.. ARGGGGG! Called back talked to csr and then transferred to billing person and they seemed helpful and put a trouble ticket in for issue. Gave me a ticket # and sounded legit.5/22 - Did not hear from anyone so I decided to call back - call disconnected.. ARGGGG! Called back and talked to csr that states ticket closed with no resolution..(WTF!.. said to self.) Oh I forgot to mention that the technician that came out on 5/14 took one of the digital adapters that belonged to my previous cable\ internet provider. (Why the hell would they do this! It did not even belong to Comcast.) I talked with csr and they seemed that they would take care of this. States not able to credit all today but should be credited by 5/27. Csr was very helpful and states will follow up on equipment that was taken as well. Csr even gave me an extension where they can be reached and specific 855 phone # to call as well.5/29 - Called back and talked csr - States only refunded $100.00 as of 5/26 - Explained try reach rep. at ext. - Csr states she in FL (Explained that rep from prev. was in SC) - Csr states she try to help... After several holds and csr reading notes on my acct. rep came back online and states that did I know that was being billed in ""advance"". Explained to rep. to explain the difference in issue of ""past due"" and ""billing in advance."" (I knew that this issue was a lot for csr to handle as they are not the one who handled initially (rep in SC)). So I asked for supervisor... CALL DISCONNECTED!"
"Ron of Bellingham, WA",5/30/2015,,We moved on Tuesday and finally got through to a technician who understood Comcast's system requirements on Friday afternoon. We spoke with four people who could not help us get the phone and TV working. All that was required was confirming we had moved but nobody seemed to know that we had to confirm the move to get activated. Very poor training of staff and extremely frustrating when you are moving to a new address. The last woman we spoke with did understand what was wrong. It just took a few days to find the right employee.
"angela of Pontiac, MI",5/30/2015,,"Comcast customer service is a joke. I have been calling them for over a week. I've been placed on hold each time only to be disconnected, and when you finally get someone, they all tell several different lies. I'm so frustrated and disappointed with their tacky services."
"Susan of Forked River, NJ",5/30/2015,,"I have put up with Comcast for over 17 years. I went into Comcast after they took over Adelphia. The Comcast techs and customer service just continue to get worse and worse. My combined bill each month for phone, internet, and tv was over $200.00. Do you think they would value a high paying customer? My phone, internet, and tv all started acting up and I woke up to find none of them working. After speaking to a different customer service person for each device and getting frustrated to the max with each one's ineptness.. I finally asked for someone to come to my home. They made an appt for the next day between 1-3. They called and said he was running late and would it be okay if he came at 4pm. It got to be 6pm and still no tech or call from Comcast. At 7pm, being very frustrated at sitting here all day waiting for service, I rescheduled again for the next day at 8-12 noon. Again, no show by the tech person even after I confirmed at 10am that someone was still honoring this appt. I must have talked to seven different customer service people over these two days. They keep saying they are sorry but never follow through... you keep getting passed over from one person to the next without anyone taking care of you. At 1pm yesterday, after realizing once again that I was being stood up... I decided to leave Comcast after many many years of poor treatment from them. I am having DirecTV installed and using Verizon phone and Internet. While I have heard stories about these companies too.... nothing can be as horrible as Comcast... Whoever is the head of the company needs to go! They need to drastically fix the frontline here meaning those individuals dealing with public. I have enjoyed Comcast TV but honestly, I just can't deal with being treated like a piece of crap especially with the amount of money that I am billed each month by them...it is really too bad that they have monopoly on cable, phone, and internet in my area. I need the internet to work from home..and I need to be treat with respect. I waited and waited but my time is obvious not important to them..."
"Deanna of Townsend, TN",5/30/2015,,"I researched for Comcast on the internet and then called Comcast to speak to a representative. I told her the services I wanted and ask what Comcast had to offer in my area as a new customer. I was given a bundle package for television and internet for $79.99 a month, with the total monthly fee of $103.00 after taxes & fees were added with a 2-year agreement. I was also to receive a $250.00 Visa gift card as a bonus for signing up for the bundle deal. I agreed to allow Comcast to become my service provider based on this agreement. The Comcast representative emailed me a very detailed summary showing all services I would receive and a breakdown of all monthly charges. Based on this information, I allowed their equipment to be installed in my home. After the installation, I asked the installer about how I would receive my first bill and my Visa gift card. He was clueless but said I should just call 1 800 Comcast. I called and spoke to another Comcast representative who told me not to worry, I would receive my first bill in the mail in a few days. Almost two weeks later, I received a bill for over $136.00 instead of the $103.00 that I had in writing. I checked the bill carefully to see if it was extra charges for more the one month, it was NOT. I called Comcast yet again and explained my experience in great detail. I was asked to forward them my email with my offer which I did while on the phone with them. I was told that it would be no problem to change my bill to the price I was offered, they were just having difficulty adjusting the account and would take care of it within 24 hours. I was called back later that day and told that they would NOT honor the agreement that they made with me because their representative was using outdated equipment and gave me a package that no longer existed. I spent quite some time on the phone with Comcast, including speaking to supervisors. I was told the only way I could keep my services was to agree to pay a higher price for same package which was $40.00 more a month from my written offer. I ask the supervisor to email me the information he was telling me over the phone so that I would have the information in writing. He told me that he had no way of sending an email to me! I ask him to have a representative or service provider to remove their equipment from my home. He told me they would NOT send anyone to remove the equipment, I would have to do it myself. So now I am left with a decision, remove and return equipment myself or pay their extortion fees. In my opinion, this is a clear case of FRAUD and unfair business practices. Be careful if you choose to do business with this company!"
"Rafiqul of Boston, MA",5/31/2015,,"Comcast is terrible. I don't usually do reviews, but this time I feel that the potential Comcast customers should know what they are getting into once they sign up for Comcast services. I have been with Comcast the past 5 years and I never saw the services so bad. I signed up for a triple play with maximum 125 MBPS blast internet speed. That was what I was told in the beginning. Everything went pretty well till this March when things started to go really awry.First the speed came down to about 40-45 MBPS. But I didn't complain much because it was still good enough for browsing. But in April, 2015 I wanted to watch some cricket matches (the world cup) by live streaming. I just could not get my TV stream anything. I complained to customer services, and after about 5 days they did send out a technician. Have you ever had a Comcast technician come and fix the problem for you? They are so bloody arrogant and make you feel so low. Typical attitude: How stupid are you not to be able to figure out the solution for yourself; They do something and tell you everything will be fine from now. And the problem remains and you have no idea what was the issue and what he fixed. They make you feel like they are bestowing a huge honor just by showing up to your door. They are always out of the door in 5 minutes max. So the problem remained and I complained to customers services again. After another week or so they let me know that maybe the problem is with the router. So they said someone will come and replace the router and everything will be fine.The technician came, installed a new router and was out of my place before the router was actually online. Before leaving, he asked me to get an usb cable and other things from Amazon to speed up my services. I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about when I am supposed to have a wireless connection for all devices and I have a small apartment and all devices are close to the router. Finally I decided I have had enough (my internet speed is now down to 15 MBPS) and I cancelled the services from June 4, 2015. I called them o/a May 24 and schedule return of all equipment. I also pay all my outstanding bills. Imagine my consternation I receive a new bill of $122 for services from June 4 to July 3, 2015. I called the customer services again and somehow navigate my way to speak to someone at the payments department. I tell him my problem and he asks me to call cancellation department and resolve this. I request him to send a note to cancellation department or maybe talk to them internally to resolve my problem. He flatly tells me, that's not something they do and it is my responsibility that I resolve it with cancellation department. Ridiculous internal communication and follow up. I guess in order to not be charged with bills for services not received, I shall have to call them again. So sad. Comcast used to be a good company. Next time I will choose a smaller service provider who will attend to my needs and solve my problem. I wish some of us will get together and file a class action suit to hold these Company to better standards. You pay a lot and in return you are treated so bad that it hurts."
"Carl of Chico, CA",5/31/2015,,Comcast has told me that they will review my recorded conversation with their sales rep. I told him NO. But they sent me equipment anyway and upgraded me to a service I did not agree to. The box has never been opened. Four times they promised to call me back with their review findings within two days. Last call I made to them they promised to send someone out to change my service back. No one has ever called to set a time to come out. I have invested several hours in talking with this huckster sleazy communications company that falls to honestly communicate. What they are doing does not seem legal.
"edward of Seattle, WA",5/31/2015,,I am on disability. I get paid once a month and yet they put late charges on my bill. I have told them reported this to the BBB and still I can not get no help. They are taking what money I have to keep it on. All I want is understanding on what I can and cannot do. I can verify my disability. I will report this to media on TV.
"Cid of Colorado Springs, CO",5/31/2015,,Comcast truck number ** Colorado plate ** Worker number ** shows up to connect my neighbor's cable and instead disconnects my internet. NOT only was he extremely rude he also blamed yet another worker for HIS mistake. Now I have no internet and have to wait for yet another idiot to fix their mistake. Service with a sneer. Now I am paying for internet I don't get!
"tom of Colonial Beach, VA",5/31/2015,,"Called them to get service. Quoted a price for 3 TV's and free install. 4 hours to hook up. Only needed two TV's. 1st monthâ€™s bill charged install. Called 3+ hours and they reversed that. 2nd monthâ€™s bill was 20 more than the quoted price. Called 3+ hours and they inform me I have two boxes which costs an extra $20. Was told â€œ3 TV's for the said price but if you charge more please remove anything extra and send someone to come get it thank you."" They agreed and that 2nd box stopped working before I hung up the phone and I unhooked it and put it on the porch for them to pick up.3rd bill came with a letter still charging me for the box that does not work and they never came and picked up and another letter saying my bill was going to go up $20.20 next month. Called them up. They reversed a 9.00 charge but said because I still had the box I need to pay the monthly rental. FOR A BOX THEY TURNED OFF AND AGREED TO PICK UP! I cancelled this headache right then and there and supposedly they are picking up the equipment as I'm not driving anywhere for this junk they brought to my house. They delivered it and they can pick it up especially since nothing I was told was ever true. My TV turned off while I was on the phone and all their junk is sitting on my front porch since the night before their scheduled pick up. I'm sure they will try to charge me for this as well."
"Erin of Quincy, MA",5/31/2015,,"DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO COMCAST. Due to the virtual monopoly that Comcast holds over the Greater Boston area I had no choice but to use this company. They are HORRIBLE! I just finished my 5th, that's right, 5th call with Comcast this month to dispute my bill. Originally, I called because a bundle deal I had apparently expired, even though when I initially signed up for the bundle I was told there would be no expiration on the rates. I called and explained the situation and was told that there had been a mistake and rates had gone up. I was then forced into signing up for a bundle again (or so I thought) because I was told that it was the cheapest rate. Since that first call three weeks ago, my bill has risen by almost 40$. Each time I call, I then go look at my account and Comcast has added more fees on instead of reducing them as I was guaranteed they would. I have basic cable and high-speed internet and my current bill is MORE than what I used to pay with full cable and Internet!!! I called again today and was told that the bundle I was offered was non-existent! Apparently there was a technical error on their computer system yet I am being held responsible for this bill. Comcast never bothered to notify me this deal was unobtainable nor did they offer any insight into how to rectify the problem. All I was told, by a senior supervisor, was that I had to pay the bill and it would be rectified next month. I told the supervisor I was moving out of the state and would be canceling Comcast this month so there would be no future bills. Supervisor essentially told me ""tough luck"" and then became defensive when I said I felt manipulated by this company. I told the supervisor that I wanted to cancel everything right then and there, but apparently that's too much for Comcast to handle. Agents can't rectify cancellation issues and I was told I have to call another division, no contact information, no helpful tips, nothing. This is the WORST company I have ever dealt with and their service is something comparable to toxic sewage. In fact, I am going to make it my personal mission to help everyone I know and encounter to also become disillusioned with this horrendous business model. I will be sure to post reviews of this nature on every site that I can and I will never, ever use this company again. I would rather be mauled by a pack of wolves than give Comcast my business and you should be aware that if you use this company you will be ROBBED!!! If there was a choice more emphatic than angry, like ""volcanic eruption of rage"" I would have chosen that. Angry is the biggest understatement of the century. Get it together Comcast. Oh wait you can't, because your very foundations are the definition of vile and evil."
"James of Chicago, IL",5/31/2015,,"WARNING: COMCAST BUSINESS and COMCAST RESIDENTIAL are similar to discussions with the U.S. and Afghanistan. Different languages, different leaders, different goals and expectations. I live in a high rise building. My office was on the 2nd floor and my residence on the 66th floor. The building recently converted to Comcast and the nightmare began. Currently Comcast -called me- to upgrade my service to X1. I informed them that this is an older building but Comcast just re-wired it.Numerous phone calls, emails, and promises resulted in my phone lines being disconnected and no new service. Business customer service at Comcast stops at 5PM Friday and restarts at 6AM on Monday. My lines went dead at 4:30 PM CST on a Friday. My good fortune was to reach someone, after an 18 minute hold, and request reinstatement of the phone service. It took over 2 hours.I have been in constant contact with the office of Tom Karinshak. ""We value your feedback. Please know that we are actively investigating your concern. A representative from Tom Karinshak's office will contact you within one business day."" This is the auto responder. Since that time I have a dozen reps that offer assistance but have delivered nothing. I have, to date, 152 responses.On Tuesday, May 26 a rep from Comcast came to my residence. He informed me that X1 would not work in this unit. He called Comcast and informed them of the situation. I personally talked to Comcast Executive Office in Oakbrook and we all agreed to stop the installation order paperwork and leave ALL services alone. Today, May 31 all my phones are disconnected. Because it is Sunday I can't get them turned back on till Monday. This is the second time in one month that Comcast Business and Comcast Residential can't communicate. With over 23 hours of my personal time, dozens of reps, hundreds of emails, not one person has offered any compensation or adjustments. No one person took total ownership of the responsibilities to resolve these issues. No one person has been able to bridge the gap between Comcast Business and Comcast Residential.Bottom line it has been over a year since Comcast took over the building. My total bills are in excess of $350 per month for internet, phone, and cable services. I am so frustrated and angry I have listed my home for sale. I have lived here since 1985 and the continual escalation of the 'lifeline' of communication leaves me with no other choice. AT&T does not want to service analog phone lines. AT&T and DIRECTV are not choices in a building controlled by Comcast wiring, etc. Comcast, in my opinion ranks as one of the worst customer concentric organizations I have experienced in my life.If you have a choice between providers Comcast should be your last alternative. Here's the response from the business rep that asked me to call him back on Monday, May 18. ""Sorry I cannot call you, I am on inbound calls today. The number 8553366983 is the correct number if you're moving business to business and setting up services. But if it's residential to business, you'll need to get a hold of the residential side to find out their number to cancel any further porting on the telephone end."" I am spending too much of my time on this matter. This is total disregard for me as a customer."
"shannon of Mt Pleasant, SC",5/31/2015,,"Basically, my phone was hacked. They were calling me and harassing me to upgrade my service which was bogus. It wasn't Comcast, it was some outside hired help from another country. My monthly payments went way high after a year.. so I am trying to break it off but they are making it impossible. The only acknowledgement I get now is because they want money. Extremely diabolic company!"
"Mukesh of Jersey City, NJ",6/1/2015,,"Having slow internet connections since last few days, have results from speedtest. Called Comcast rep to discuss about this. There was no resolution. Calls got disconnected multiple times. Seems like Comcast reps do not want to work on solving connrctivity issues."
"Larry of Dunwoody, GA",6/1/2015,,"I tried Comcast under the 30 day free trial. The service did work well! But for other reasons I cancelled the account within the 30 day period. Their technician came out to take back the equipment - so far so good. But they kept billing me, and now have turned the 'free, no obligation, nothing owed' bill over to a collection agency. I have had no less than 3 people at Comcast who all assured me that they can and will fix this problem, but I continue to get calls. The collection agency tells me that I owe Comcast money, Comcast tells me I don't owe anything. It just shouldn't be this hard. They obviously still do not care about customer service - how hard can it be to fix this problem???"
"Cheryll of Memphis , TN",6/1/2015,,"I had an inferior install by TriWire after a 3 day delay. Had to get occupant in house behind me to unlock his gate. Agent refused to leave a Comcast door request and forced me to knock on this strangers door multiple times before I reached him. The TriWire agent left my cables on the ground for me to fall over, expecting me to pay $300 to bury the cable. TriWire also hand tightened the cables in my attic by hand leaving me with poor signal to tv and bad internet connections. Did not place phone line to modem so almost a month later when my phone was ported, I got no service at all. My 79 year old Mother had no phone while I was hospitalized. Increased anxiety caused me increased PAIN. Infinity did finally REINSTALL my cables properly several days and many phone calls later. Also quoted wrong package price. Told agents I do not like missing feature of pause and rewind. Told that even though first DVR is $7.99 extra box is extra $20 per MONTH. I paid $6 extra for DVR with DirecTv. Ludicrous!!! Have had to have multiple box resets because the picture goes out or gets hung on screen. Calling in for help is a nightmare - I have been hung up on 3 times after lengthy hold times. My box says I rented something I've never even HEARD of today. No battery backup in phone. I could go on for hours about the poor customer service in getting my phone ported over, and in general. I would not at this time recommend your service to my worst enemy... I don't have any enemies except Comcast!"
"Richard of Micklton, NJ",6/1/2015,,"My bill come for the next billing cycle and has risen $18.28. I had the X-1 platform installed about 8 months ago. The salesman quoted $181.81 for bundle plus services for two years promotion package. I think their rates are high, but OK. I've been paying that amount over the months. Now this month's bill is more with no explanation. I call Comcast for reason and they tell me my account was audited and I was incorrectly billed for extra boxes in my kids' rooms. To bring it back down they would send a service tech to replace the boxes with cheaper boxes. Now I'm in business, If I make a mistake I have to learn to live with it. It's very poor customer relations to send customers increased bill for their error. None of the customer service reps would do anything about it. I don't think it is unreasonable for them to make correct the bill to the original amount. For me it was very important, for them it would have been a small but appreciated gesture. Very poor business customer relationship. I'm disgusted! I have Verizon Fios at work for a reason."
"Dave of Lambertville, NJ",6/2/2015,,"My daughter had an appointment with a Comcast for an install on Friday May 29th. The tech showed up was incompetent and said that someone would be out Monday to fix the problem. The tech showed up Monday called the wrong phone number when he arrived BUT was given the correct number to call. HE DIDN'T BOTHER TO CALL THAT NUMBER HE JUST LEFT. When she called Comcast they said someone would be there Friday a whole week after it was supposed to be done. After 6 hours on the phone with this poor excuse for a company speaking to at least 8 different minions, she was promised someone would be there the next day (Tuesday) at 3 pm. 3 pm came and went. Again she called they told her someone be there Monday the 8th of June. What happened to 3 pm or even Friday. Again several phone calls to Comcast with no resolution. All they could say is ""we are sorry for the inconvenience."" Nothing about fixing the problem. This is the poorest excuse for a company I've ever seen. When is someone going to do something about this! My daughter is studying for the CPA exam and has no internet service to use."
"sharon of North Charleston, SC",6/2/2015,,"I have been a Comcast customer over 20 years and satisfied with the service. 2 months ago I started having problems with my internet and home service. Television was never interrupted. I was told since I live close to RR tracks, the signal could interfere with my service. I was also told same story about the Air Force base. Once that lie was disproven, I was told to move my modem to an outlet that only modem would use as modem was not getting enough power. Still getting kicked off internet and no phone service. The next day I replaced the modem @ Comcast and all the power lines and cable they supplied. Still getting kicked off internet and no phone service. @ the request of Comcast I replaced the splitter at my expense. I finally get fixed (I hope) then asked for a credit and was told I was lying, that I never called about this problem. Demanded to speak to someone else about getting a credit and was told this would not fix the problem! I agreed it would not fix the problem but make me feel better about paying for a service I could not use. I finally hung up. I will call everyday and ask for credit ."
"charles of West Memphis, AR",6/2/2015,,"So, after having gone over Comcast's measly 300Gb data cap for a full year, I call up to cancel. I'm transferred to customer retention, where I explain my problem. Which is: I signed up for unlimited Internet. You changed the unlimited to limited because you don't like people streaming Netflix or downloading video games or you know, any of the 1000s of reasons people have for using the Internet. This wonderful customer retention specialist tells me he can give me a 500gb data cap and free HBO for a year. Wow. And just the month before I called to see about getting a higher package but was told that 300gb is the highest limit for residential customers. Whatever. Maybe they changed their mind. I took it. First month after that, no problems. Second month, my bill comes in and sure enough, I'm being charged for data overages. Called up Comcast again. 45 minute wait time. Just to be told that I was never signed up for any 500gb data cap plan, that the month where I wasn't charged for overages was a month where they had given me a ""pass""...one of three months allotted for customers who go over their data allotment. I've been going over my data plan for two years straight. I used those three months up the first three months they began instituting data caps. Liars. That's all these people do. Say something to get you off the phone and let someone else deal with you later. From now on, I'll record every call I have with these thieving liars and I urge everyone else to do the same. And when you catch them, post it where people can see."
"D. of Pekin, IL",6/2/2015,,Horrible company. I was lied to by Customer Service Reps and my bill keeps changing in price. Tried to cancel service & was put on hold by a Rep and they never picked the call back up. Waited 3 hours on hold before I gave in & hung up.
"Fern of Seaside, CA",6/2/2015,,"I signed up for the Xfinity Triple play a year ago. When my one year contract was up my bill went from $128.00 to $178.00. I called Customer Service and said I wanted to cancel the TV and phone and keep the same Internet service as we presently have. I was told that it would be $89.00 for just the Internet. I said I couldn't believe it was that much since I was canceling two services, TV and phone. The CS rep was very blase and said that was the fee and one only got the deal with the Triple Play. I said I looked online and Comcast was offering the same Internet service for $59.00 per month plus tax. I was told that this was for new customers only. I asked if there were any deals/promotions for existing customers. I was told ""no"" that there weren't any but I should check from time to time.Of course, Comcast will never give a deal to existing customer as it seems they are only interested in snagging new customers with the Triple Play deal. I ended up canceling TV and phone and keeping the Internet as I don't want to go with another company and get a deal for a year and then be jacked up to a much higher rate. By the way, I have had the same experience with AT&T; so they are all the same. They care nothing about existing customers."
"Judith of Miami, FL",6/2/2015,,Our employee works from home 3 days out of the week. We provide the internet. Saturday her internet service was shut off. There was a Comcast tech outside and he accused her of stealing internet. He said she had to take it up with Comcast that he was there to connect her new neighbors internet and saw she was stealing from them. He made no sense when he was there to connect them but she was stealing from them. She called and they said they would send someone. It's now Tuesday and still nobody has come.
"Josh of West Valley City, UT",6/3/2015,,Comcast is the worst company I have had the opportunity to deal with. I have called to disconnect my account with them several times over the past few months and still charged me for services I didn't use. I have had dishNET since December but Comcast charged me until February! It's Crap and that company should be brought down for fraud!
"tap of Kennesaw, GA",6/3/2015,,Wish I could give a negative star for the customer service representative....the way he respond.
"Luis of Dania Beach, FL",6/3/2015,,"I called this morning at 9am with a request to have a technician come out to fix our telephone lines. Our phones are dead. I was told that a service tech would be out by 530pm. Well a tech showed up at 3:45pm but he was here to fix our internet. We never called about a problem with internet. So, the tech informs us that he does not have the parts to fix our phone system (he needed a modem). The tech says no worries, someone will be out soon. I meant that to mean today. Wouldn't you? Not feeling very confident I called in again and your customer service department has our issue closed!! Fixed!! Really? Now I am being told that I will have to wait another day for service. What I am really angry about is the tech telling me someone would be here soon when he knew that they really weren't coming at all."
"Janette of Colorado Springs, CO",6/3/2015,,"Comcast/Xfinity technicians were doing some maintenance in our area thenâ€¦ While they were doing that our connections got cut-off. So my husband then called for help at Comcast/Xfinity customer service. So we did not have connections for 24 hours coz the repair was scheduled the next day. So the next day they repaired the lines. They found out that our line got cut-off from the box (the technicians who were doing some maintenance in the area made a mistake by cutting-off our wire connections from the box). The SAD part is they charged us $74.55 for Residential Trouble call. They charged US for THEIR MISTAKE? So I did online chat w/ their customer service agent. The result is good but not FAIR. They already charged my bank account for that $74.55 and when I asked if they could returned that amount immediately in my account, the agent said ""NO""... It's gonna be deducted on my next billing. So I have to wait for another month just get back my $74.55."
"John of Elmhurst, IL",6/3/2015,,"This is COMPLAINT about the IGNORANT company Comcast. During the first week of December 2014 I started having problems with my Comcast internet connection. Web pages would stop loading or wouldn't load at all. The lights would go out on the modem I own & then come on again within 2 minutes. I hoped that it was a temporary problem & would fix itself. It got worse & happened more often & I waited until Mid-January to make my first call to Comcast's so-called customer service line. I don't remember how many calls I made in January but I am sure it was much more than one before a service call was scheduled. The guy that came out replaced worn parts on the outside line or lines. He also told me that my neighbor across the street was having the same problem.The Comcast guy said there was work or an upgrade being done to the system which was causing the problem. He told me to call again at the end of February if the Comcast internet connection was still not working properly. For a few days after he left it worked properly & then the problem got worse than it was before the supposed January repairs. I called Comcast's so-called customer service line again at the end of February the guy that was sent out did nothing & claimed the Comcast internet connection was working properly. The problem continued & got worse. I called & called & called. No one knew what they were doing or how to arrange to have the problem repaired. Comcast has no idea the stress they caused me.Comcast has a department called retention or as they answer customer solutions. THEY ARE A JOKE!!! They have no way of communicating with the local people. They claim they do but believe me they don't. On a Sunday afternoon in early March 2015 I was called by a Comcast guy who said he was from the local office & we had a long conversation about the problem & I agreed to take my self-built Windows 7 computer to a local shop for a complete diagnostic. I also agreed to replace my modem if my computer had no problems. My computer was working perfectly so I replaced my modem on a one-time free replacement warranty. This was the third modem in 2 years with Comcast. The problem continued. So then in April or May 2015 a local field supervisor called & agreed that the cable that was installed by U-verse in 2009 that runs 2/3 around my home should be replaced along with the rest of the cablesâ€¦ He offered to give me his personal cell phone number but I told him to give me only his work number. I left about 10 messages with him over a week & I never heard from him again. 4 times I had to cancel because of bad weather & road construction in front of my home. Finally I thought I had it arranged just after Memorial Day to have the cables replaced. I asked the guy as soon as I opened my front door if he knew what I was told would be done. He didn't & I told him to leave. I did the same thing on June 1, 2015 for the same reason. The problem continued & I kept calling. Comcast's so-called customer service line is a JOKE & I am being extremely nice when I say that. The vast majority of people at the Comcast so-called customer service line have no idea what to do about a severe problem & so many of them have such heavy accents I couldn't understand them. The problem after nearly 7 Months finally started getting better & since May 29, 2015 is working properly. I deserve to know what caused the problem & how & when it was fixed. It remains to be seen if it will stay that way & if it doesn't I will be calling them again."
"Frank of Hollywood, FL",6/3/2015,,"Comcast installed my service on DIRECTV's wiring, resulting in poor service. A tech came out and decided we definitely needed the correct wiring and I would not be charged since Comcast failed to wire my home from the start. I received a bill for $500 for wiring. For 4 months I spoke to 13 people, including a visit to the local Comcast office. All customer service reps and billing dept reps assured me on every call that the bill would be fixed while my service was constantly be suspended. Yes, they never fixed the bill or refrained from suspending my service every few days so now I'm done with them. I'm a new, happy customer of AT&T, with great service and customer service. Comcast has the worst customer service I've ever experienced."
"Anne of Denver, CO",6/4/2015,,"I would like to file a complaint regarding Comcast. I have had services with them since September 2014 (internet, home security and cable). I will not get into the multitude of problems I have encountered over the past year. I have been attempting to contact Comcast to disconnect all of my services as I am being relocated overseas by my employer. The first time I called (5/30) I was told that they were having computer issues with individuals who had my kind of account, and that I would have to call back to disconnect services. I have attempted to contact them again today. I was transferred three separate times and asked to repeat all of my identifying information. Apparently, I kept getting transferred to the wrong person. On the third transfer, I spoke with someone who said that I would still have to pay $500 to cancel my services because of a two year contract. I explained that I was not moving somewhere in the US, where I would have an option to continue my services with Comcast and maintain my contract. I do not have a choice in the matter and am moving to a place where they do not provide services. Comcast is adamant that this fee is still owed, when no other service provider is claiming this. Virtually every other company has stated that since I am moving to a location where they do not offer services, the cancellation fee is voided. I asked to speak to a manager ** who placed me on hold repeatedly. She came back with the same response. I requested to speak with one of her superiors. I have now been on hold for 63 minutes and no one has come on the line. I am not sure if they are finding a supervisor, if they are giving me the run-around, or are waiting for me to give up and end the call.I am extremely frustrated. I would like my services disconnected with no early termination fee since I do not have the option to continue my contract. They are providing sub-standard customer service all around and at this point, I would never return to Comcast for any kind of service if/when I return to the US due to the way I have been treated by them. It is clear that they do not value or respect their customers."
"Tonia of Jacksonville, FL",6/4/2015,,"Comcast is the worst company in the US. I moved and wanted my telephone services ported. Comcast has not done so. I spoke with several supervisors. They assured me this matter would be taken care of. I spent several hours on the phone still not resolved. I went to the Comcast store, spoke with a team leader **, and she assured me this would be handled. Still no phone service. This company should be put out of BUSINESS. CLOSE THE DOORS. THEY HAVE NO CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS. Very disappointed. SMH."
"Teresa of Portland, OR",6/4/2015,,"We planned to migrate our phones to Comcast in May 20, 2015. The salesperson had to resend the agreement to me three or four times because of mistakes he made. Then we received a notice regarding the installation. After reading the information we realized we did not have all the information needed to determine whether we could actually set up the phones with Comcast. We decided, with Comcast, that a site survey was warranted. At that time a technician came out and explained that there was no problem, Comcast could run a connection into the office that needed the base phone, never bringing up the line for the credit card machine. Once the installation technician came on May 20th, we discovered that the credit card machine would have to be rewired in order to connect it to the new Comcast system. We were not willing to do that and at that time cancelled the order.We asked the Technician what was required to cancel the port over from Century Link. He stated that we did not need to do anything. Then on May 27th, our phones were shut off by Century Link. We then spoke to Century Link which told us the numbers were with Comcast, however Comcast said they were not. I spoke to multiple people at both companies, many saying the same thing for a week. Finally I spoke to ** at Century Links win back department on June 3. That is when we were told that Comcast needed to send a cancellation of the porting order to Century Link Wholesale group before Century Link could turn the phones back on. Century Link had been trying to reach the Porting in department at Comcast since 5/29. The phone was never answered or the e-mail requests responded to.I then called Comcast and spoke to ** in customer service on 6/3. He said he understood what needed to happen and he tried to call the Comcast Porting in department and got no answer. He then transferred my call to that department. It was now getting to be 4 pm our time, 5pm Colorado time, which is where this department is located. The phone was picked up and then immediately hung up. Then today we called Comcast and spoke to **. He was incredibly rude and unwilling to help. I asked for a Supervisor, and ** told me a Supervisor will just tell you the same thing. And that the Supervisor was busy. I told him I would hold. Finally ** came back on the line and said he would e-mail the proof that Comcast had sent the cancellation to Century Link.I did receive the e-mail and called Century Link back. They in fact did get the cancellation order from Comcast. Now the phone lines are finally up and going. Because Comcast did not complete their cancellation order to Century Link our phones have been disconnected for a week. And we have spent 2 hrs and 15 minutes on a private cell phone just since 6/1."
"Marlene of Inver Grove Heights, MN",6/4/2015,,"I attempted to cancel all services today and Comcast stated I had a binding contract with them via a phone call made in Dec. 2014. I said, ""Well, since you record all conversations, could you please let me hear this phone conversation"". They told me I would have to go down to 5330 South Robert Street in West St. Paul to listen to the verbal phone recording. I went down there and they stated they were unable to have me listen to this recording, but I could call billing department. I said, ""Well previously this morning I spoke with billing, customer service and Loyalty dept."" So they gave me a number and wanted to step aside and I informed them that no you will take care of me first. So I called the number and ** the supervisor tells me nicely to step aside and I say no nicely. The person on the other side tells me I have a binding contract. I said ""ok let me listen to it."" She comes back on the line and says that her team is listening it to it right now. Meanwhile I tell ** that he can talk to this gal. He informs me that he can't talk about my account because that is private. I said, ""Excuse me but you are looking at my account so I'm sure you can talk with this gal on the other end **"". I basically told ** I was not leaving until I received cancellation of service. So the employee then proceeds to tell me that I owe more money as in December my services went from $212.56 down to $199.32. So I owe the difference but she would cancel my service if I paid some $91.00 approx. I said, ""Look you can't show me any proof that I had a contract and I am not paying you anymore. Please stop all service June 30, 2015. I don't want other aging persons to go what I have went thru to get service canceled."" ** told me at one point that I could be sitting on my comfortable couch at home and disconnect services. I told ** I worked this morning at doing so and all I got was the runaround!"
"Renee of Decatur, GA",6/4/2015,,"I called Comcast to set up a post dated payment with my mom's bank card. Well she went out of town before I could deposit the money into her account so I couldn't get in touch with her to get her account number so I can deposit the money in her account. So as soon as I got paid that Friday I paid the bill come to find out they still took the payment from her account and I understand that a postdated payment can't be changed once made, but that's two payments for the same amount to the same bill. And now they say I can't get a refund because of the policy. I ask to speak to the manager. They told me a manager would be calling me in 72 hours. It's been 5 days now still no call. Comcast sucks!"
"sharon of Brick, NJ",6/4/2015,,"I realize I hit a rough patch and was a month behind BUT according to Comcast own bill I have until 6/8/2015 to either pay past due OR the full balance or lose service. Today is JUNE 4TH and service was suspended. FOUR days before THEIR statement said it would. Now I have to pay a reconnection fee when COMCAST CUT SERVICES FOUR DAYS EARLY? FYI I would have the entire balance tomorrow JUNE 5th, THREE DAYS BEFORE THE CUT OFF NOTICE."
"weimin of Lehigh Acres, FL",6/4/2015,,"Exactly the second day of every month, I paid Comcast from my bank account $19.99, the agreed price for monthly internet service. I never missed a payment. After a year, they suddenly sent me a statement saying, without any explanation, I have an overdue balance of $88.38 in April, 2015. I disconnected the service. Then in May they sent me a second bill and the overdue payment became $187.28. When the third bill came, the balance became $100.72.How can I take them seriously? Customers are not money cows to milk the way they want and I have to pay whatever came out of their mouth. Behind the MCI-style billing there is only one possibility. $88.38 was too small an amount for any debt collectors to buy so they blew it to $187.28. Then they felt it might be too much for me to pay, so now they have reduced it to $100.72. This way they are prepared either for this sucker to pay or sell it the collection agency.Many online reviews tell me they are dishonest because they don't tell you the whole truth in doing business. They are arrogant because they think they can subdue you by threatening. They are despicable because they would pound all over you if they think they have a chance. Let me be clear. If I am not convinced with their explanation, they don't get one more penny from me. I need to publicize this experience."
"BARB of Castle Rock, CO",6/5/2015,,"I have been a long time customer with Comcast - 11+ years at one location. Overall my service with them has been great! Their Customer Service Department has always been helpful and would ""talk me off the ledge"" whenever I was upset (which was not often) - UNTIL NOW! Several weeks ago I called them to just ""inquire"" about the cost of a popular fight that my boyfriend wanted to order (Note: I was just ""inquiring on the fee not to order). During this call the young lady mentioned she could LOWER my bill by offering me this ""new technology DVR"". I am not a technical person but always interested in lowering my bill if the service would not change - only would improve! She ""assured"" me it would go from $143/month down to $121/month. She did not inform me of any install fees or equipment fees. She said it would just be less with better technology. I agreed and scheduled a time for a Technician to come and install it.A Contract Working (very nice young man) arrived and installed the new DVR. I was impressed with all the features and I was excited about all of its features. (record 4 shows at one time as opposed to just two). After he left on that Saturday morning it was great for less than 24 hours. I was having to unplug the DVR to ""reboot"" the system, wait 10 minutes for it to reconnect. Sometimes this would work - other times not all. I would go several hours without any service and was forced to watch a small t.v. in my bedroom and forced to watch commercials! And now it doesn't work at all during the evening. :-( Also, the internet is running very poorly now as well, takes anywhere from a minimum of 5 minutes to as long as 12 minutes to connect. I've never had such poor service with Comcast. Horrible!!I have spent most of my evenings talking/complaining to Comcast. I have had a technician come out to rectify the problem. He spent a half hour fixing connections in my walls. That seemed to work for about a day. I then got my first bill. What a nightmare experience that was. The bill was for $355. I immediately got on the phone with Comcast to have that error rectified. The original call I made to just ""inquire"" about the cost of the fight - the woman from Comcast scheduled the fight on my bill. She also loaded me up with Triple Play (DVR, internet, and phone). I do not even own a home phone line. Ugh! I also had installation charges and fees that were never explained to me. After 2.5 hours of talking to Comcast Supervisors they were able to ""talk me off the cliff"". All the charges were waived - including a $70 fee to send a Technician to my house to fix this DVR issue - which this fee was NEVER explained to me either. This is Comcast equipment that has never worked correctly and they are CHARGING the consumer to make it right. What??? After much energy and time they lowered my bill below $100 and gave me three movie channels and they guaranteed me that my bill will remain at this rate for two years. After three weeks of virtually no service, after nightly phone calls to Comcast, after scheduling another Technician to come out to see if they can rectify this ongoing issue I have decided it is not worth it any longer. I want my old DVR back. Now they tell me that they are phasing out the old Legacy DVR - we will all be forced to use this new technology that doesn't work. I will be leaving Comcast soon!"
"Jan of Chicago, IL",6/5/2015,,"I moved to another unit within the same building. I made a moving request online on May 30th. The system gave me 4th of June as a re-connection date. It also gave me a confirmation page and a confirmation number **. It was also written that I was going to get contacted in 24 hours. No one contacted me. I waited for 4 days without internet and today (June 4th) called the number written on my confirmation page. The representative I talked with told me that there is no moving requests in their system. When I asked why I have a confirmation number the answer was ""I don't know"". He wanted me to make another moving request online. I did and it gives me June 10th for the re-connection date! Is this some kind of joke? Now I have to wait 6 more days without internet? And Comcast going to charge me 60 dollars for the month of June when I don't have the service for one third of the month just because they can't move my service to a different unit in the same building? I don't understand why when you start the service it starts the same day, right away but when you want to move it it takes 5 days???"
"Makayla of Boca Raton, FL",6/5/2015,,"Comcast has overcharged us every month for years. Usually just a few dollars, until they started charging us for a Modem we never leased. We have cancelled all cable service and now only use Internet at a quoted rate of $39.99 per month. My bill for June - $290.04. What am I being charged for? I may never know because Comcast Customer Service lines are not working. The Chat system - pathetic."
"Caitie of Vergennes, VT",6/5/2015,,"I have their 105mb Blast internet and the 60 channel line-up plus HBO and Streampix. I have been having nothing but problems with inconsistent internet speeds and I lost 6 channels that I was supposed to have because they didn't want to correct their error. Instead when I proved to them that I was supposed to have these channels they changed what my line-up showed as on my account overview. Now, just to state this...I actually did not originally want TV through them. I had just the 105mb internet but when I sent in for a new router/modem they sent me a cable box along with it. I called, they gave me some deductions for their error and then offered me the deal I currently have. They told me it would be $89/month. Well, my first bill after the deductions they pushed through was $50. My second bill is now $137. Basically they are making me pay for the deductions. This company has done nothing but rip people off for years. Oh but on top of all of the mistakes they have made and the horrible billing...I have had to deal with some people through tech support that didn't even know what they were talking about along with others who were pure attitude and even swore over the phone. I am NOT happy with their service, I am NOT happy with their employees and I am NOT happy about their billing. If I could cancel without ensuing terrible fees or at least downgrade back to my standard internet I would. I am even getting charged for the old router/modem when I sent it back! I am nothing but perturbed!"
"Heather of Davie, FL",6/5/2015,,"Since 2010, I have had several issues with Comcast, but mainly with my home phone, which is through them. Unfortunately, I didn't keep detailed records but in the last five years I have consistently called and complained that my phone wasn't working. I have spent days and days over the years on the phone with Comcast and/or waiting for them to show up at my house to fix the problem. I have purchased new phones, switched them around and have tried everything on my end. Comcast has been out on many occasions and has changed out a line, moved my phones around, changed the modem and nothing has fixed the problem. I have gotten reprimanded by my previous supervisor on many occasions because my phone wasn't working and I wasn't able to attend conference calls and important meetings. I missed calls from my children's schools, doctors, messages, etc. as a result. I ended up having to purchase a $200 device from AT&T so my cell phone would work in my house.While I didn't call Comcast every day of my life, I have called them consistently over the years. The most recent time someone was out in March, the technician moved my phone bases around and charged me $70! This has caused a lot of unnecessary anxiety and stress in my life. Comcast's practices have been extremely unethical and down right disgusting. They never call me back, they constantly bill me incorrectly, they get you to agree to contracts over the phone without telling you the details and they get away with it. I spoke to someone from Corporate Liaison department to look into my issues. He ultimately told me I haven't complained enough and there's nothing he can do since I'm in a contract. I only asked they cancel my phone service since it hasn't worked in five years and he refused. If there's a contract in place, both parties need to uphold their side of it and Comcast is not. Something must be done about Comcast. They have the monopoly on Cable Internet so they know they can do whatever they want to their customers. It is truly sickening what they get away with and it needs to stop."
"Huaiying of Denton, TX",6/5/2015,,"I placed an order to start a Comcast TV and internet service before I move on June 3rd. I clearly stated that I want the self-installation kit sent to my current address which is in Texas. I want the TV and internet service in IL. I placed the order early so that I will receive it before I move and I will move the kit with me when it arrives. However, they mailed the kit to my future address, which is in Chicago, IL (I found out by the shipping notice via email). I called their customer service phone, and the lady didn't give me a solution, just redirect me to a mysterious sales and billing department where no one ever answers their phone. So I gave up, I called UPS instead to delay the package until I am in Chicago, IL. In order to delay the package, I will have to pay $6. Why I have to be responsible for the shipping error they made? And no one at Comcast end responses to solve the problem."
"Gloria of Conshohocken, PA",6/6/2015,,"I moved to a new apt and - even though I have FIOS -- Xfinity pop up asking me to sign up. Continues to pop up and pop up. I clicked on the ""manage my preferences"" click and opted out. But Nooooo. A day later, there it is. Same laptop, same email address. I called and called and got an alternate # to call. After hold for 20 minutes, it hung up on me. What can I do?"
"Dorothy of Tinton Falls, NJ",6/6/2015,,"We have had the same phone number for 46 years. We have had Comcast for as long as we have had internet access. 3 weeks ago, we moved 9 miles to a new community. Comcast assured us we could keep our phone number. All seemed well until this morning when we had no dial tone. Their customer service rep said we needed a new modem. Got one. Still no dial tone. Customer service rep #2 says that our new phone number needed to be activated. What new phone number, we asked - we want to keep our old number. Not possible. The 3 weeks it worked at our new home was just a courtesy transition. We cannot keep our old number. They lied. No one gave us the new phone number. So now, we have a dead phone with a number we don't know. Comcast is TERRIBLE and they LIE!"
"Ankara of Boca Raton, FL",6/6/2015,,"Comcast's service is terrible even AFTER you've closed your account with them. Last February, I switched to a different cable provider because I was so frustrated with the poor quality of Comcast's digital cable service (pixelated images, went on the fritz every time there was a strong wind, raised rates every January without improving service, etc.). The technicians were always friendly and helpful, but the quality of the cable never improved. So I switched to another company. Lo and behold, I continued receiving bills from Comcast even after paying my final bill and returning all the equipment. This happened several times. Each time I received a bill, I called them to find out what was going on and I was told, each time, that Comcast made a mistake, that my account should be closed, and that I should disregard the bill. Let me not forget to mention that, each time I called to discuss this billing issue, the rep tried to get me to sign up for Comcast again and to upgrade my service. I told them that this sales pitch was one of the many reasons why I was frustrated with Comcast. Today (June), I received a bill from a collection agency saying that I owe this money to Comcast and legal action would be taken if I don't pay up. So I called Comcast, explained everything for the umpteenth time and was told that this was the remaining balance on my account. The rep suggested I settle the bill and my account would be finally closed. I told her I would settle the bill because I don't have access to the kinds of lawyers that could make Comcast's life difficult and I just want this to be over, even though I was told before that I should disregard the bill. Now I also have to call the collection agency to tell them that I'm paying this but don't want it to show up on my credit report. Not only is Comcast a terrible and unethical company but they'll also try to ruin your credit rating if you're not careful. I will NEVER purchase Comcast service again, and I will also advise every person I know to stay away from this awful, awful company."
"Heidi of Baltimore, MD",6/6/2015,,"Comcast installed equipment without asking me that was not included in the monthly price they quoted me. Then later on I get a letter saying my bill is going up $19.95/mo because of these ""services."" It took 3 appointments and hours on the phone to get my services installed in the first place and now I have to have a fourth appointment to get the equipment they ""sold"" me without asking me out of my apartment. Scam!"
"Amy of Stone Mountain, GA",6/6/2015,,Promotional deal of 99 dollars a month. Our first bill was given to us two day it was installed of 414.13. Since then we have had so many things gone wrong with our service. Would I recommended this company to anyone? No but he'll no.
"Thor of St. Paul, MN",6/7/2015,,"I was not home when the Comcast Tech comes to install internet service for my new house. I have an antenna cable connected from the outside box to a three-way splitter in the basement to my living room, family room and new bed room in the basement. I drew a diagram for my wife to give to the tech to follow. I wanted to make sure he just install a new cable for the internet to the living room. The tech cut my antenna connection outside, and all my connections in the basement, and took my splitter. Already filed a complaint and requested Comcast to fix that back in place."
"G of Burien, WA",6/7/2015,,"This company is garbage and they know it. They provide the minimum in order to get subscriptions and they charge out the ass. I have had internet on and off for the last few months and every time I call them about it, somehow it becomes an issue with my equipment. They then threaten you with a fee if they find out that their equipment attached to your building is not at fault. I have changed my router and modem twice, I know it is not my equipment, it is their service. All you will get is excuse after excuse from them. If they did not have the monopoly they would never exist."
"Annette of Ft Myers, FL",6/7/2015,,"I have been with Comcast for a year now, my bill is never the same amount. When I first got Comcast I was provided a dollar amount by your rep who came to the complex where I live, & my bill has been two times that amount but yet I have the same package."
"Deborash of Seattle, WA",6/7/2015,,"I had never quite understood the near-universal loathing for Comcast. Sure, it is difficult to cancel services, or to figure out how I am being billed, but that is unfortunately true for a lot of outlets. Yes, they are generally hours outside of their service window, forcing you to take a whole day off of work rather than the promised two hours. It was not until this past week, however, that I came to understand why Comcast is perhaps the most hated service of the modern era.I was supposed to have cable and high-speed internet installed in the house that I am moving into. I often work from home and needed to have my service installed before moving, so made an appointment well in advance. The technician failed to show between 8:00 and 10:00 AM as promised. Fine, I've had this before; called at 10:20 to find out how much longer the technician was likely to be, and, after twenty minutes wading through a phone tree and being put on hold, was told, ""They are running a little late but will be there soon."" A few hours later, no technician, so I call again. This time, it took me twenty minutes to get a person on the phone, and a half-hour on the phone with her to establish that my appointment had been ""put on hold"" and that the customer service representative could not figure out why. She told me that dispatch would call within 30 to 60 minutes and explain what was going on.Ninety minutes later, no return call, so I called again. This time, I had to call three times before the phone tree let me through to a person. ""Yeah, your installation is on hold because the technician came to install and you weren't there."" No, I was there, and they didn't show up. Forty-five minutes of customer service time later, with the customer service representative putting me on hold four or five times, and promising that the installation could be rescheduled for the following day, her phone cut out, and I of course could not get the same person again. I called back, and, again, three times, attempted to make it through the phone tree, finally got put on hold, only to get a message an hour later that Comcast was no longer able to take my call.I called back the next morning. The service representative told me that the soonest they could reschedule my appointment for was the following Wednesday and that, even though this was 100% the fault of Comcast, even though I had to take the whole day off of work for the technician to not show up, and even though I had specifically scheduled the installation before moving so that I could work from home, too bad, they couldn't install any sooner; that was after an hour on the phone, escalating my complaint to a supervisor. Total time wasted waiting on Comcast to not show up: ten hours. Total time wasted on the phone with Comcast trying to resolve this issue: five hours. Total number of technicians who lied about showing up to install my service when I was sitting in the house waiting: one."
"Robbie of Nashville, TN",6/7/2015,,False marketing to get you to change your package and then later saying they made a mistake and since you changed your package then must sign a two year contract to obtain it back. They will place you on hold and never call you back (thirty days of drama) and still waiting.
"Rasim of Woodbridge, VA",6/8/2015,,"It is so Shaming. I was about to go with Verizon for my business with one phone line and internet they were offering me 112$ month to month. Just called to ask the price from Comcast the guy there told me that taxes in Verizon are high and Comcast is the best. I have signed my lease for business which I closed for a year but Comcast without telling me signed me up for 3 years. The person on the phone never told me that I am going to have Comcast in next 3 years even though I had my lease for one year. I called to customer service to cancel it and found out that I am stuck with them and the worst part is they don't let me go out of contract without signing the paper that I am going to pay them 75% of left contract. I have taken Contracts law and never saw similar type of contract when one party tries to go out of contract he can not. This is my civil right to break the contract. and by contract law the damage I caused I might be paying but in this case the damage for Comcast will be 120$ 10 $ a month discount that they gave me. So instead of paying 120$ more a year they now inducing me to pay 75 %, ridiculous. I have contacted to Comcast several times , asked the supervisor they told me they are going to call me and I have never received a call. Last time when I talked to representative in Comcast I asked her to give me in writing that somebody is going to call me but I have never heard anything. Comcast thinks That I am going to pay them, No I will wait till you take me to court where you will definitely loose."
"Jane of North Port, FL",6/8/2015,,"I tried contacting Comcast/Xfinity's service phone number. The person who answered was unable to help and when I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told the wait time was 10 minutes. In the meantime I asked to speak to someone in the United States. He said he would give me the number of someone the the US (in other words, Comcast outsources their employees). When I called, it was the same recording! I called the first number back, and asked the gentleman with the thick accent where he was located. He hung up on me!"
"Michael of Annapolis, MD",6/8/2015,,"From the first day, our experience with Comcast has been terrible. The first installer was hours late. He did a sloppy installation, leaving a giant coil of cable and not installing connectors correctly. The second technician said the first was a contractor and ""that happens"" - as if that should excuse it. Since then there have been non-stop problems with the set top boxes and the network/phone interface. Other Comcast Voice customers often can't hear our voice when we call. One of our four setup boxes malfunction or lock up on the average - approximately once per week. Solution from customer service rep every time we call in after waiting 10 to 20 minutes on hold - unplug, reboot, and wait 5 minutes for the defective box to restart. We have had the service for 9 months. It was bad as ever. I recently turned off the WiFi portion of the cable modem and installed an external unit that I bought because the Comcast WiFi kept going up and down all the time. I am looking at ways of trimming back on Comcast triple-play bundle services and substituting other vendors until our 2 year contract is up. Never again!! "
"Emma of Pembroke Pines, FL",6/9/2015,,"First, I updated the internet to Business, expecting to have a faster speed. Nothing has change but the bill, yes went up very high. The home phone was added to the business and have it back to the residential took me 2 months and several calls. Finally I have it back, but they gave me a temporary number while they make the changes. Guess what? When I make phone calls, the number that appears in the callers ID's is not mine - is the temporary one. Usually my bank pay my bills, but this month I check the Comcast bill and noticed charges for services that I never asked for. They keep billing me for the internet besides the bill I pay for the Business. Double charges. This is the worst company I ever had. Thinking in change to another internet provider."
"Jason of Saint Cloud, FL",6/9/2015,,I want to first say that this is the first time I ever took the time to write a bad review about a company. Being a business owner myself I know what it takes to satisfy my customers but will say Comcast has shown me that they are the worst customer service with no satisfaction company that I have ever had in my 37 years. I am being very honest here about this and it's not personal.
"Gerald of Southwick, MA",6/9/2015,,I find it amazing that Comcast can run a commercial about customer service. Their customer service is the poorest that I dealt with in my life. When I asked to go to corporate level I'm told I can mail them a letter. Unbelievable. If you have any choice definitely don't pick Comcast.
"Lonnie of Jacksonville , FL",6/9/2015,,"When speaking to sales, I was quoted $228.63 as the total price. My first bill was $379.95. I accepted that as an installation charge. My second bill was $317.36 with an additional installation charge. They did agree to remove the extra $45.00 installation fee but refused to honor their quoted price and instead, said my new bill will be $262.32 monthly. A charge of $33.69 over their original estimate. Based on my experience, Comcast seems to purposely encourage their sales reps to mislead and lie to customers to secure sales and then strong-arm them over contract issues. Such unprofessional and corrupt behavior by a company makes me question all future dealings with said company. I am now stuck in a 2-year relationship with a company that I cannot trust and find truly disgraceful!!!"
"LISA of York, PA",6/10/2015,,I needed a new on demand box. Tried to order over the phone. I received 2 remotes which was not even the correct address. Tried calling again. This time I received 1 remote. Still no box. Ok off to the local Comcast office. After half hour in line I finally received my box but found out they changed our billing address to our vacation home address. They can't fix in office. Back to the phone. Took the box home and tried to hook up. They now tell me there are no such numbers. They are because they are on the back of their box no receipt. No appointment in days. Someone help me of this poor pathetic company!
"Lee of Berwyn, PA",6/10/2015,,"We move out of our house in 3 weeks. The buyers of our house set up Comcast service three weeks before they own the house. Comcast discontinued our service, the current owners, because the buyers set up their service. How could we, the owners, with an active account, be cut off when our account was paid and nobody contacted us about disconnecting our service? The buyers gave the settlement date, which is three weeks from now. Comcast made a big mistake. We spent hours on the phone and online chat room to resolve this issue."
"marguerite of Texas City, TX",6/10/2015,,"Tell being responsible and accurate to Comcast. I paid my Comcast bill around 6/04/15 and 6/5/15. Called them because my services was off. Past due amount was $209.83. It came right out of the account. A couple of days later I am at work my phone send me a alert that Comcast has taken $209.83. I got on the website and started talking to a live agent. I explained what happen (I have the transcript). I was told it hadn't crossed over because it was still pending on my account, so they gave me a number to call. I did the next day. I explain everything again and they had notes. It was people from Mexico. They told me I authorized this on 5/28/15. I told them that didn't make any sense, because if they look back I never did that to any of my payments. Then a smartass tell me ""well $188 will be due in a couple of days."" So what that still does not give this ** company to take out money again after I have already paid the bill. 6 different ** told me different things, none of which negates the fact they stole money. I have several overdraws from this ** that they pulled. And to top that off they to me I have to contact my debit card company to get it back. What kind of ** is this."
"Marie of Christiana, TN",6/11/2015,,"False advertisement. Plain and simple. I signed up for 79.99/ month starter double play and got a package for 99.00/ month. I called 30 minutes after installation when I realized there were problems. They told me sorry, nothing they could do since I was no longer a new customer. Seriously?? Also, their 39.95 installation is actually 79.95. They won't tell you the 39.95 is just for the tech to pull into your driveway... The other is a 20.00 fee for a video line and a 20.00 fee for an internet line. I've never had Comcast. I've been a DirecTV customer for 10 years, but I needed internet and sadly Comcast internet is so high you may as well bundle with your cable. I'm very disappointed so far, and its only been 6 days. I would like to one day see a choice for cable... These companies ate a monopoly. Unless of course you want satellite... And don't even get me started on satellite internet!"
"Jim of Camas, WA",6/11/2015,,This is beyond any doubt the worst company I have ever dealt with in my 75 years of doing business. I put them on auto pay when I first signed up and their billing was so screwed up that I could not trust them so I removed auto pay and delay with them thru snail mail. Their bill would come late and when it arrived I would pay my bill and they would try to charge me a late fee. I could never get a clear understanding of the charges and how they billed even when I got someone who spoke English well enough to understand.I moved from Cal to Washington and use their moving department who promised me a certain price and a $300 credit card... I set a moving date which I had to change by a couple of days. When that happened the deal changed although they did not tell me at the time that I changed the installation day. Later I found out that the price had all gone up and I lost my $300 card because I had simple delayed the installation date. I move to DirecTV and FILO internet and so far so good.
"KIMBERLY of Lithonia, GA",6/11/2015,,"When calling, you are on hold for 30 to 1 hr waiting, then transferred, and disconnected. Only to have to call back numerous times to solve it. Then notes are never entered properly so no one honors anything that was said from a previous rep. The bill is way too high and the company raises prices because they can and they are the only provider around. They charge ridiculous fees as well. It is impossible to work out arrangements with them if needed because the account is never noted properly so they say. So you have to argue to get any kind of assistance and is way too stressful. They are refusing to work with me and I am trying."
"morgan of Marietta, GA",6/11/2015,,I lowered my plan and removed DVR service. 3 months go by and they send me a letter saying they reviewed my account and are going to start charging me $10 for DVR service. I call and tell them I don't want the DVR. A couple days go by and I still have DVR service. I call again and tell them to cancel my cable service because they refuse to get rid of my DVR service. The lady said she would cancel it. Another day goes by and I still have cable service. I call again and ask why I still have cable and they said that the person never canceled it. The person on the phone said he would cancel it within 24 hours. I told him I don't believe him and I would stay on the phone till it's off. About 10 seconds go by and he turned it off.
"Virginia of Eau Claire, WI",6/11/2015,,"I am a seasonal customer from Port Charlotte, FL and have Comcast on seasonal hold as they promised that it is very cheap to just put the account on hold. So a couple days before we were ready to leave, I called and told them to place me on hold. They sent me my normal bill and I contacted them again and told them no, that I needed the seasonal hold rate and a new bill. Never received a new bill but when I go and look at my account online wow is all I can say! I have so many charges the bill is now up to over $94.00! I was told under $20.00 per month. Even had the balls to now add a late fee! I did not ever receive a corrected bill to even pay from yet a late fee? Really?? They never tried to send me any kind of bill other than the full amount for a month I would not be there. Well now they want $64.00 for a half month besides all the other charges for who knows what because there is no explanation.. I only had the service for the month for 3 days yet being charged for a half month! I did live chat today and the person said they took care of the bill and all is okay now after I paid them $28.55 which he said that was all that was owed to date.. Nope. The payment I made to them they only took off the top of the $94.00 bill I do not owe. This is crazy. They will not stop overcharging me and now I am way up north away from them so can't even go in person to try and stop this mess."
"Khanh of Tallahassee, FL",6/11/2015,,"I spoke with a rep by the ""so called"" name of **. I told him that the bill did not make sense because it looked like I got double billed. He tried to tell me that they bill ahead of time. My bill was for May 18 - June 17 and payment due date was for $155. I moved on May 16 so this payment should have been applied to the new address and the services cut off. I paid that at the end of the month that it was due and it should have been applied to the new bill. According to the billing when I check, I still owe on the old house for may 18 - June 17 even though we did not live there anymore and services were ""Transferred"" and supposed to be cut off. I have paid around $150 each month since I started and all of a sudden, my bill may 18 to June 17 is $371. He kept stating that they rolled over the last month bill already and according to their bill, it shows that my payment is applied but it does not reflect on any bills and he never seemed to understand simple math. If the only difference is $20 video install and $39.95 install visit, why is my bill jacked up $150? He kept giving me the run around. I was on the phone with him for over 1.5 hours and now I have been on hold with his supervisor for 25 minutes and waiting. The funny thing he said is ""if you want to speak with a supervisor, you will be waiting for a long time."" He constantly interrupted and seemed to not want to listen to any reasoning but to just tell me what he thought was right. But it did not make sense that they charged for 2 months. I am assuming he makes me wait so I will hang up but he is wrong. I am on the phone for the long haul. I finally get ** back on the line and he said that he is transferring me to the supervisor and then I get a hang up signal. I try and call back and all of a sudden it states that they are closed. How convenient. WORST customer services ever!!!!!!"
"Reginald of Pearland, TX",6/11/2015,,When I moved to our new home I was not aware that Comcast service was not available in my neighborhood. Which forced me to cancel my Comcast subscriptions since I was not able to receive Comcast services (I was very satisfied with the services provided). Now the sticky part it seems that Comcast is dictating where I can live if you have an existing Comcast service contract. If you happen to move to a neighborhood that is not serviced by Comcast you have to pay an outrageous cancellation fee. Mine was $756.82.
"Sharon of Lake Worth , FL",6/12/2015,,This is the first time writing a review about any company. I was having issues with connecting to my interest and had to call 5 times before giving up. 3 of their reps hung up on me and the other two transfer me to other department. I hate Comcast!!
"Dylan of Atlanta, GA",6/12/2015,,"For anyone who wants a good laugh please read. There are many things that are common complaints made by customers, like taking hours on the phone, or bait and switch pricing, or never getting an issue fixed. And we know Comcast knows, but they never admit it. Until today. Today, I called Comcast, because I'm in my 12 month promotional period and my price keeps getting increased. Below is what I learned.My bill is in two parts, one part is promotional and has not increased, the second non-promotional part was increased. I was told this meant they were maintaining the promotional price. Comcast told me they had no power to change my price back, because it was set by the system. I asked to speak to the person in the company who sets prices. I was told that there is NO Comcast employee who sets prices, but that they're system generated.After, finding out the above, I came to the obvious conclusion that the sales people offer promotional prices, with no intention of the customer keeping them. After all, it is literally impossible for Comcast to maintain that price, because the computer can change prices at will, and no one in the company can undo it. To check my reasoning, I asked the Comcast employee on the line this same question who confirmed it. I explained the above and asked, ""So I was offered a promotional price and Comcast had no intention of giving me that price."" She said, ""That is correct.""I suggested just taking $X dollars off my price. I was told that wasn't an option for a price in the system. I then asked to speak to their IT group to get that fixed for her. She happily said, ""yes, of course."" (I then asked her not to connect me. That would be worthless). Even better, Comcast has this recorded. I'd love to see how their leadership responds to knowing that their phones reps are telling customers that all their marketing is just a bait and switch scam."
"maria of Bradenton, FL",6/12/2015,,"I contact both providers the same day to request an estimate. Both of them asked for my credit card #. They assure me it's only to make a computer to process the request & give the best rate. Well, a few days later, they both charge my credit card. I called them & finally they credit me. The worst was Xfinity. They claimed they cannot find me??? So I have to ask my credit card to stop payment."
"halona of Reston, VA",6/12/2015,,"Despite having pictures of the error messages coming up on my screen directly from Comcast, they will not fix the service. With all the bad reviews, there should be a mechanism for the federal government to protect the consumer against the abuse and criminal treatment by Comcast."
"Rebecca of Middleboro, MA",6/12/2015,,I have been in queue for online chat with a customer service rep for 40+ minutes. I've been 1 in queue for 20 minutes. I chose online chat because I didn't want to get stuck on hold for an hour on the phone. I have one simple question--where is my self-service box that was scheduled to arrive 3 days ago? I can't get internet access without it.
"Bill of Joelton, TN",6/13/2015,,"I tried to reach Comcast customer support because my data usage has gone through the roof for no apparent reason. By phone: I called the support number on the website. Support said for data usage issues I should press 1. I pressed 1. Then I was offered two options that would not have helped me. I did nothing. Comcast hung up. I tried the same scenario again, with the same result. By phone again: This time I called and did not press 1. That led to more options, none of which related to my issue. I pressed nothing, and Comcast hung up. By chat: I got just a few lines into a chat, and the chat window froze. End of short discussion. By email: Then I chose the email option for support. Over 12 hours later, no response.By chat again: So I tried chat again, just now, because this extreme data usage (287GB in just 12 days) will end up costing me big overage fees. This time I was able to have a conversation, be it at a slow pace. And I had to repeat my main question to finally get the answer that, ""No, there isn't a way to monitor hour-to-hour usage"" to try to troubleshoot what is causing the problem. At some point, I finally had to end the chat because I did not anticipate it taking so long. Before I had to leave the chat, I asked the support agent to send me any other suggestions or information. When I was able to return to the computer, the chat window was closed (no final message), and I have received no email, either.Priority zero: Comcast's customer service boss says we customers are priority one. I think he missed it by one digit. Now I have a choice to unplug internet until I find a solution or a new ISP... OR continue to rely on internet service and end up with usage three times the normal and costing probably $60 to $70 in overage charges this month."
"Ci of The Woodlands, TX",6/13/2015,,I sign up with Comcast 2 month ago.. For internet and phone for 59.95 I have received the bills over 200$. After I called them they was saying that they never had promotions like that. I transfer the phone line to Verizon and I called them back 3 weeks later because the bills went even higher and my service was disconnected.. When I called them the bill was over 180$. They said that no one from Verizon did to called them to transfer the phone and they still was charging me for the phone and tax some different fees... They did not returned my money back now I planning to move to a different company. I would sue them if I would've have more time....
"Charles of Dolton , IL",6/13/2015,,I been waiting a week for my service to get repair! I have a down cable wire in my yard and I can't get a Comcast tech to come fix the problem. This have been going on over a week now. Customer service have been LYING to me all of this time and nothing have been done yet. This is the worst treatment that I have ever been through of any services!
"Jessica of Chicago, IL",6/13/2015,,"This is only the third review I have written (the first two were positive), but I have to share my negative experiences with Comcast. I should have noted the red flag and fled to a more reliable company after my first call to Comcast... It was an inquiry about the different packages available and the price. I was on the line for over an hour - on and off of hold - and I didn't get any information. The agent told me she would call back with the information, and she did not.The next day (Sunday) I called again and was quickly able to get a price and schedule installation (I don't know what the woman was doing the previous day while I was on hold!). When I scheduled installation for the earliest date (five days later on the Friday), I explained that my contractor would meet the Comcast technician. The Comcast agent told me the technician would call thirty minutes before arriving. At this point, I emphasized that this was essential because the contractor might need to collect materials. The technician did not call until he was waiting at the front door. When my contractor told him he would be ten minutes, he said he could not wait. I called the technician back a few hours later and he was very rude and unhelpful. When I asked for his name he hesitated and then said, ""Bob."" Clearly an intelligent chap...such a convincing lie! I called him out on the lie and he said he wasn't allowed to give me a name. So...back to the delightful task of trying to get through the minefield that is the automated call system to complain to an agent! I eventually reached an agent, and was placed back on hold. The call lasted for one hour and a technician was not scheduled. She told me she would call me back that evening as soon as she had managed to schedule a technician to come out. Of course, there was no callback. 90 minutes later I called Comcast AGAIN, and spoke with another rude and unhelpful representative. She could not reschedule a technician for another five days. I asked to speak with a supervisor, she told me they would not be able to help. I said I would like to cancel my account, and that I would be reviewing my negative experience, and she said okay. There was absolutely no effort to compensate for the poor service and no apology; this resulted in a terminated account. Recommendations for new providers are welcome... :) In short, DO NOT even attempt to join Comcast; their customer service is non-existent!"
"Peggy of Centennial , CO",6/14/2015,,"I added internet service to my Comcast service. It's been a month & 90% of the time I try to access the internet, I have to either reset my modem or call them to fix the connection. THIS is a such a rip off. Unfortunately, I didn't cancel in time to not be binding in a contract for 2 yrs."
"Iris of Washington, DC",6/14/2015,,"For months, Comcast kept sending me ""notices"" that my modem was obsolete and needed to be replaced. So, I would ask for a technician, who NEVER showed up on three separate occasions. When the land line went totally dead, I called Comcast and someone stated that it wasn't the modem, and that I needed to purchase a new phone. So, I purchase a new phone, and the line is still dead.After 50,000 emails and angry phone calls, they finally resolve to send a technician. HE DID NOT SHOW UP. Finally, an employee who didn't have mental issues or a brain destroyed by weed contacted me and sent over a very competent and professional technician. This issue could have been resolved in less than 20 minutes and it took 48 hours worth of shouting and escalated blood pressure. Shortly thereafter, they disconnected the new modem again out of spite. I resolved not to pay anything until that land line was restored, so I guess someone must have put the pacifier down and turned the modem back on.My neighborhood and my apartment complex has no other option for service. This mega corporation, filled with employees who articulate in a drug induced manner, should be shut down, or taken over by genuine people instead of genuine cockroaches. They are a thorn in the side of consumers. If you have any other options, please DO NOT use Comcast. They are evil, satanic, despicable and most of all, stupid and incompetent."
"KENNETH of Montgomery Village , MD",6/15/2015,,"Every day I have problems with my internet and home phone. I go on Youtube and it stops working, keeps breaking up two to five minutes to get on a site. Comcast cable has been out to my house so many times I can't remember. It took three or four Comcast repairmen to fix my phone. The last one one minute fixed because none of them know what they are doing. They need to be certified. Three times they told I need a new phone. Anyway where I live the service sucks."
"connie of Jacksonville, FL",6/15/2015,,I called Customer Service 4 times - 4 times!!! And each time I had to go through this lengthy call flow that was so ridiculous but anyway each time I held and each time they would drop me off or end the call without service!!! Each time!!! After going through the call flow and each time never getting an opportunity to speak to anyone because they kept me holding forever and then the phone would just go dead like someone picked up then hung up!!! Worst service ever!!
"Pete of Aurora, IL",6/15/2015,,"I'm just starting my own landscaping company and my customer asked me if I could bury his gutter spout, so of course I said yes. Well, I dug just a couple inches down and I accidentally severed the orange cable. Well of course I feel REALLY Bad but anyways, him and his wife are pharmacist and they NEED their computers. Well he called and they said they can't have anybody come out till THURSDAY!!! Well, needless to say they also have children and now they can't even watch tv. Well I'm writing this cause to save me and my new business I'm trying and struggling to build. I'm asking or begging is there anyone that works for Comcast. Is there anyway that one of you could make it out there to just fix just one wire I severed??? I literally beg one of you please!!! You can reach me at ** or email me at... **. To whomever helps me I can't thank you enough!!! GOD BLESS!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR Time..."
"Gregory of Alexandria, VA",6/15/2015,,"When calling Comcast (already have cable and Internet) they offered to bundle and offered phone service. They confirmed (I have a copy of the Internet chat with the Comcast rep to verify) that I would not lose phone service while they converted to comcast. My mother in law had a health emergency 12 days later and the phone was dead. I called comcast and could not get through to a person. Once I finally did, they would not connect me to a person that could help, despite me asking repeatedly asking for a manager. I had to drive my loved one on the hospital because 911 would not work. She arrived late and it has jeopardized her recovery. I am in the process of consulting with a lawyer from the Department of Justice. Comcast should be shut down."
"S. of Sacramento, CA",6/16/2015,,"This is a 3 story residence, with extremely light internet activity, but I have experienced NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS with Comcast! I went to the extreme of paying an additional $12 a month to boost my internet speed, with absolutely NO positive changes or results. Furthermore...and mark my words: there is no solution. No matter how much money you pay to correct this - no matter how many calls you make to reset your modem (which I pay EXTRA for Comcast to provide) - NOTHING will make this situation better. The internet connection is so pathetic I OFTEN cannot even download a browser connection. Think twice before paying for their services! To be perfectly honest, I have spoken to some extremely accommodating representatives who have tried their damnedest to help me - but no matter how many amazing friendly representatives you reach, nothing, absolutely NOTHING resolves my issues with high speed internet. Think twice! I tell ya."
"Jameson of Denver, CO",6/16/2015,,"I was a Comcast customer for over 10 years and was never thoroughly impressed with their service in general. (If that seems like it was too long to not enjoy, consider that all cable/satellite providers have bad referrals.) When I moved to Charlotte, NC I had to switch to another provider because Comcast is not available in the area. I was asked to provide proof that I was relocating for work to terminate my contract without the penalty. I personally went to the Comcast service center and provided that proof. A Comcast representative assured me that they would waive the early termination fee and even showed me the $0 early termination line on my account. 1 month later I received a bill from Comcast with a $518 early termination fee. I assumed it was a mistake and called Comcast. To my disbelief, they retracted the waived fee and acted like it was a policy to screw 10+ year loyal customers. I will never do business with them again and swear to spread this story to as many people as possible. On the bright side, it was charged to a credit card that I will challenge the charge and Comcast will never see another penny of mine. I hope this changes at least one persons mind if they ever consider Comcast vs any other provider. WORST SERVICE IN THE INDUSTRY (or any industry at all)!!!"
"SHERINE of Coconut Creek, FL",6/16/2015,,I recently purchase a house and the association has a basic bulk package going on with Comcast which gives about 10 channels. I call to upgrade to a package with more tv/Internet/phone and Comcast cannot do that. Other persons in community upgraded their services. Really don't understand why they're telling me this crap!
"Lambert of Jackson, MI",6/16/2015,,"My internet continues to go out. When I finally use my detective skills to find their number, I get a computer. Finally get to a person that can't talk English and repeats themselves over and over. I'm pretty sure they are instructed to do this to discourage phone calls. I get nowhere and almost wish the computer would come back. At least it made a bit more sense. Had to take extra prescription medication to get through the evening. There should be more competition that would weed out these lousy companies that should be illegal."
"Maria of Kennesaw, GA",6/17/2015,,"So, I was a loyal Comcast customer for over 10 years, beginning in 2000. Then, I started having trouble with some of my services and decided to give AT&T U-Verse a shot, since they finally showed up in my community. Loved it, loved them, and loved their consistent attention and care for their customers not to say they don't have issues at times, but they handle things so very well that they make you feel bad for even bringing it up. That said I had to move, just up the street to a new community, and I am being forced to use Comcast (Bulk services?). I upgraded to the triple play back on the 5th of June, and was told that the equipment would be delivered within 3-5 business days. Great. Fantastic. On the 10th I called just to see where things were, to ask when I might be receiving my equipment, and was told that the order was still sitting in their system with a ""pending"" status, so had never been forwarded to the warehouse that ships the equipment. I asked how that could possibly have happened, and I also asked what would have been the outcome had I not called to check. Dude said, ""No one would have known if you had not called"" What?! So I said, ""Alrighty then. Let's get that fixed -- and by the way can you send that to me fast-tracked, since I am now without TV, Internet, or phone?"" He said, ""No problem. Just one thing though, you're gonna need to pay $29 for the quicker shipment."" At that point I was so frustrated that I just said whatever and he said they would ""share"" the cost with me. You know, like it was MY fault that they didn't do their jobs correctly the first time. Fine. On the 15th, still no equipment. Third call. ""Oh, wait. We just now sent that package out to you and we don't have any actual tracking information to help determine when you will actually get the package. Could be tomorrow, could be a couple of days after that."" Package showed up on the 16th. But wait, there were only two of the four pieces of equipment I was expecting. Fourth call. Rep says, ""Your account activity actually shows that it's been cancelled...and it looks like prior to the cancellation, there were only two pieces of equipment ordered."" What?! Yep...four reps and two supervisors later, I am being told that I now have to wait for a call tomorrow (18th) for the account to be straightened out and if I try to make any changes to the account (since none of the reps actually got my itemization correct), then ""the audit department would make it so that NO SERVICES would be connected at my location"" What?! The last rep I spoke to acted as if I had called back all those times to make changes to my order, when in fact, each time I called back -- BECAUSE OF THEIR TOTAL AND COMPLETE LACK OF COMPETENCE -- I had them read back to me what was shown in the order and IT WAS NEVER CORRECT. How is that my fault? These folks really don't give a crap about customer service or just plain SERVICE for that matter. I just don't get how they can all be so callous regarding how they affect our lives. I know they have a ton of customers, and I know they have it so that you are basically stuck in certain situations or areas; however, know this...depending on where you live, work, & play, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO USE THEM AT ALL. I have the option to split up my services and only take the Basic/Expanded that the complex forces us to use and I will use another company for my internet and phone. ANY OTHER COMPANY. Almost everything you watch on Cable can now be accessed through the internet and all sorts of apps. Hulu Plus, Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Go, etc., are now viable options to completely do away with cable. Comcast has basically ensured that I will now be one of the loudest voices in the ""down-with-Comcast"" arena. My puny little dollars may not make a big difference to them but by God, I will spend the rest of my days trying to convert as many folks as I can reach. They are ridiculous. THEY NEED TO TRAIN THEIR EMPLOYEES TO ACTUALLY KNOW THEIR PRODUCT AND TO ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMERS ON THE OTHER END OF THE DOLLARS THEY COLLECT EVERY DANG MONTH!"
"wilson of Douglasville, GA",6/17/2015,,"Service was disconnected for nonpayment. Death in the family caused unexpected financial problems. 2 weeks later, a rep left a note to get the equipment! I plan to pay the bill in july... this is June. Called and waited 1 hr. No answer. Why the rep??"
"Ray of Wellington, FL",6/17/2015,,"On Friday, May 29 we started having trouble with our internet connection dropping repeatedly. On Saturday, May 30 I called Comcast and set up an appointment for Monday, June 1, between 1 and 3 pm for a tech to come. I made sure I was home that afternoon and when it was almost 3 pm I called only to find out that the appointment had been rescheduled for Wednesday, June 3, from 5 to 7 pm. No one had called to see if that appointment time was acceptable or that no one was coming for the June 1 appointment.On Wednesday, June 3, I received a call from a tech (he gave me his name as **) who said that they were working on the switching of locations from Lake Worth Road to State Road 7 and that the signal would improve by the end of that evening. I requested his phone number ** and asked him to call me the next day to verify that the problem was corrected which he agreed to do. The next day the signal had not improved (the internet continued to drop frequently). Since I had not heard back from ** I called him at about 6 pm. He indicated that he was in the middle of doing a service call and would investigate and get back to me. I never heard back from **.Later that same evening my daughter called Comcast and set up another appointment. The earliest time available was Sunday, June 7, in the morning. Another tech showed up and repaired/replaced equipment that had been installed by Comcast less than a year ago. We were never told there was a charge nor were we provided any paperwork indicating exactly what was done. On Saturday, June 13, I checked my bank account and was surprised that my balance was less than anticipated and I saw that Comcast did the auto draft on my account. While I was anticipating the draft I did not expect it to be more than my bill of $136.16. The draft was for $181.16 so I called Comcast to inquire as to why more than my bill was taken out of my account. I was told that there had been a $70 service fee placed on my account on June 8 which was prior to the draft date so the draft was increased to cover the new charge. Based on this I cancelled the auto draft for future bills and requested that the $70 charge be removed. The young lady I spoke with said she was giving the information to her supervisor and that I would hear back from the supervisor on Monday, June 15. It is after 8 pm and I have heard nothing so I called Customer Service and the gentleman I spoke to said there was no ticket for follow up. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that I would get a return call within the next 2 hours. I am not expecting the call but will keep my phone handy. The call never came...For the last few years I have thought that the service by Comcast had improved and had recently signed a two year contract rather than switch to another provider who had a promotion. I must say that this experience has taken too much of my time with the broken appointment and a tech whose work ethic was not honest. If the $70 charge is not removed from my billing and the service, should I need it, not improve I will need to seek an alternative for my internet and television. I know that Comcast was making an effort to improve the customer service. I am very disappointed with the past two weeks and how Comcast has handled this service call."
"Annie of Dyer, IN",6/17/2015,,"We got Comcast triple installed at our home we rent. The service guy came out and hooked everything up. He failed to give us our Internet password and that was December. I called several times and we still have no password. To top it off, we had the home security. We had it installed on the outside of our home because we HAD brand new snowmobiles and 2 new cars. Well, the tech failed to mention the camera doesn't record unless the alarm is tripped. With 2 large dogs and nothing fancy in our home, we placed the camera outside and obviously no one would break in our house when they could steal our $15,000 in snowmobiles. So that was never recorded because they didn't break in our house. Why the tech wouldn't inform us it was useless to put a camera outside is beyond me. So I call Comcast to cancel just the home security and they won't let me unless we pay a huge early termination fee.I start to get over all this terrible dealings with Comcast and we are moving again. I need to cancel Comcast altogether and once again they are fighting me on it. Again with the outrageous fees. So they hang up on me. Now I call back, someone will transfer me, and then hang up before the transfer person connects. It is almost like they red flag me so I can't cancel. They are impossible to deal with and completely unrealistic. It is the worst customer service I have ever received."
"Ron of Brier, WA",6/18/2015,,"Comcast has not provided the service they promise. I purchased a 100mb/sec internet plan and have not received consistent service since going with Comcast in 2008. Constant data hits (which they can't seem to detect) and, when calling to find out what the problem is, their response: ""We don't see any problems from our end."" ""We can send a technician out, but you'll be charged a service fee if a problem is not found"". Well, of course they aren't going to find a problem, because the problem is on their end. They oversell their servers and their data transmission lines become inundated and the flow is inhibited. Comcast relieves themselves of this responsibility because they use third party resources as a transfer medium. I am done with Comcast and will NEVER go back. I'll pay my 211.00 early termination fee, turn their box back in and be done."
"Federico of Chicago, IL",6/18/2015,,"Comcast charged me for the Mayweather-Pacquiao Fight that did not play. They claimed that shows up in their system as the event did play for 54 minutes, when in fact it did not. I have an SD box so I ordered it on the phone in Standard Definition and they charged me for HD. They said that in their system shows up as if I ordered from the box in HD. The fact is that I could not play the fight. When I try to call, the lines were super busy because apparently million of people were having the same issue. I've waited on the lines for approximately hour and a half and finally gave up and hang up. The charge did not show up in my account online, so I assumed I was not going to be charged with all that fuzz going on. And of course I forgot about it because believe it or not some people do have to work for a living and can not be on the phone all day and make our lives about Comcast.Of course a month later the $99 dollars show up on my account and when I called they said it was too late, that I should have call earlier. When I said that I call that same day, they said that I should have call the next day. I tried to explain that I can not make my life about them, but that did not help. I spoke to a guy in Spanish and he escalated the claim saying that by mistake the show was provided in HD and that couldn't be played it on a SD box. Of course a week later the charge was still on my account. When I called they said that my claim was denied by their credit department (Of course they did not bother notifying me). And the new representative told me that despite the fact it was in HD my box can play it anyway. Of course I'm technically savvy and I'm telling you the pay-per-view did not play in the 810 channel they claimed.Under pressure he gave me the option to discount $25 dollars that that's the only thing I'm ever going to get. And of course after having fought with 3 reps I was emotionally exhausted and finally gave up I took the $25 discount because it was not worth my emotional health and my time to keep fighting for $99 dollars. Of course by giving me those $25 dollars under cohesion they protect themselves from further claims I suppose. But regardless I feel this is a great injustice, especially after giving Comcast thousands upon thousands of dollars and they do not have any client consideration. And of course because they are a monopoly I can't cancel their service, because they are the only ISP in my area. So the multi-billion dollars company managed to get away and steel $99 dollars from my account."
"Grace of Albuquerque , NM",6/18/2015,,"I went into the local Comcast store and wanted to cancel my service because my health has deteriorated in the last couple years. Upon dealing with 3 different people, I was then directed to the person at the last stop to wring me out on why not to cancel my service with them. I explained I have been placed on a limited income due to my health, and could not afford the service at the price I had been paying. The young lady said, ""Oh I will get you fixed up and you can have better, faster service at a better price."" ""What? Really? Ok, are you sure?"" ""Yes, and it will not ever go up!""Three months later I pull a letter out of the mailbox that says, we are so sorry, we have made a mistake and the price will now be 10.00 more a month starting next month. We did not charge you for the modem. So, I called and explained the arrangement of my monthly payment and was told after climbing up the ""chain"" of professional bargainers that we are truly sorry, but you have to pay the 10.00 because of our error. I believe the large civil lawsuit that was filed against Comcast in Philadelphia that states Comcast will pay out $16.67 million in cash for overcharging customers, should have been an idea to let's do things right the first time. Guess they didn't learn a thing? Please Comcast, don't tell me that you're sorry, and can't do a thing about it and that I can pay or change my service. I paid you an installation fee and 3 months of service for which I was promised a faster speed internet of 50 mgb not the 12 I was getting. I can't even get my apps to download and play without interference every single time. I wish that large billion dollar corporations would just stop the bargains and give me a set price. If I can't afford it, I will go someplace else. Don't candy coat the deal and then say, aww, oops, sorry. How many others got this letter here in Albuquerque, NM hmmm? Stop playing games with your customers. It's wrong and illegal, remember? Very Angry."
"Terysa of Chattanooga, TN",6/18/2015,,"I moved out of the Comcast area, so my alarm system could not move with me. Comcast demanded all payments for the term of the alarm system starting over from the last time I moved. The move was not planned. I had been paying for the alarm system monthly for 6 months, then moved inside their area. Paid another couple of months before moving out of the area. The demanded payment for the full term $1100. Did not even count the first 6 months payments. I called a couple of times they said I would need to call back. They turned me over to collections, which I have paid religiously, $59 twice a month. This shows on my credit report. I will never have any kind of service with Comcast again."
"Barbara of Daly City, CA",6/18/2015,,"Every time my monthly charges change arbitrarily. I am never given an explanation as to why this happens. Their billing amounts are supposedly based on a 12 month billing cycle. However, this is what I have been billed for the last 12 months: 06/20/14 133.63, 07/10/14 80.36, 08/11/14 84.73, 09/10/14 84.73, 10/10/14 106.99, 11/12/14 106.99, 12/10/14 106/99, 01/12/15 106.99, 02/10/15 107.99, 03/10/15 107.99, 04/10/15 107.99, 05/11/15 120.38, 06/10/15 138.95.I protested against the last amount and was given an adjustment, so that my actual payment was reduced to $104.56 on May 20, 2015. In addition I was offered, and accepted a new 2-year contract with monthly payments of $89.99/mo for the next 12 months. However, in my latest billing the amount of the adjustment I had received on May 20 has been added on to my latest invoice, so instead of $89.99 I am billed $115.11! It is outrageous that this unethical conduct by this company is allowed to continue. Please let me know what steps are available to me to make Comcast adhere to its contractual obligations."
"Hivya of Nmb, FL",6/18/2015,,"I am a big fan of checking products reviews and this is main reason why I am here. I wish I had checked people reviews about Comcast service before getting it. The one and only reason why I had to switch up from ATT to Comcast was because ATT do not offer a Brazilian channel that my roommate likes. However, it is impossible to keep up with how pissed I get everyday with Comcast service. The only way you can contact a customer service agent is if you act like you want to get the service, otherwise you will be on the hold for years and nobody picks up. My only advice to someone who is maybe thinking about trying it.. DO NOT! and if Comcast is the only service in your area, please move."
"Toinette of Savannah, GA",6/18/2015,,"My husband had Comcast for years. Sadly, he passed away this year and I had the difficult task of dealing with these people. I went to talk to someone at Comcast to (1) change the service over to my name and (2) get a more affordable package. After paying $600.00 between May 2nd and June 16th, I was told that my current bill was $178.00 because of past due charges, late fees etc. The monthly bill was approximately $155.00 so naturally, I was very upset.I called several times to complain that each time I paid this bill, I paid what was due. Needless to say, I got no one who was willing to satisfy a dissatisfied customer. To add insult to injury, a female customer service agent placed me on hold never returned and when I got home, my two main boxes had been mysteriously disconnected. A former technician with Comcast assured me that someone in the center had to disconnect my two main boxes because the other televisions in the house were working just fine."
"!@#$ of Baytown, TX",6/19/2015,,Comcast is the ** internet service I ever had in my life. When I started with them it was $30 for 25mbps. Now it's $35 for 6 ** Mbps. Now I pay $66 dollar for 25 Mbps. Still I cannot watch any online videos at night without buffering. This ** Comcast is the only internet service in my city - that is the only reason I still use these ** internet service.
"Dan of Flemington, NJ",6/19/2015,,"Today, Comcast sent me a letter saying that due to an error in my bill, I wasn't charged $19.95 for my subscription to ""video services,"" and they were raising my bill, effective with the next billing cycle, to $254.95. I called Comcast, and the rep told me that I had two DVR boxes; the first one was $10 and the second $19.95. I asked why is the second more than the first, and she didn't have an answer. Moreover, I only had one DVR box, so why was I charged for two in the first place?She claimed I had two boxes, and from there, the conversation deteriorated, with her threatening to disconnect the call if I continued disparaging Comcast. Finally, she admitted that my plan included two DVR boxes, so the letter correcting the ""error"" was in error itself. She said she'd give me a credit of $19.95 on my next month's bill, so in effect I'm loaning them $19.95. I asked her how many people received this letter, and she wouldn't tell me. I suspect this was a ploy to raise everyone's bill $19.95 who subscribed to this particular package. Most people wouldn't bother to call, and of those who did, most would simply accept Comcast's explanation."
"Josh of Corvallis, OR",6/20/2015,,"Since I have had Comcast, I have hated this company. Prices are ridiculous and speeds are not as promised. They use speed throttling to fool speed tests, but actual internet speeds are not close to what was promised or what speed tests show them to be. My internet constantly goes out/down, wi-fi only works part of the time, prices keep going up constantly, and they get away with all of it because there is no other competition in this area. I created this account just to leave this review and was not surprised to see that there were hundreds more like me on this site. As soon as I find any other high speed provider, Comcast will never see or hear from me again."
"naveen of Richfield, MN",6/20/2015,,"I have a Comcast xfinity internet account and I moved from one apartment to another and called Comcast customer support and informed then about the move and they said all set to go. And I asked her, ""Do I need to do anything on your site,"" she replied not required. And I have not received any email about my past due amount which is $78.80 except all promotional emails. Now a Debt collector emailed me about the due amount and I don't know whether it will be reported to credit agencies and It will affect my credit score. I called Comcast after receiving this letter and they said I need to enter my new account number to see my updated due amount. I logging using my user name and password and I called Comcast reported about my new move but they have not updated that account under my name and not even sent me any email about my payment not because of this I'm affected because of $78 amount. My credit report will have a collection account and I don't know that I have to update my account number. I will assume any system will update it when I called and reported it. This is bad experience even after paying all the required amount. I paid that amount to debt collector."
"Louis of Boca Raton, FL",6/20/2015,,"When I signed A TWO YEAR CONTRACT with COMCAST for TV, phone, and wireless service for $180 a month, I naively thought that my rate would, in fact, be firm for two years. But NO. Within six months, my rate went to over $200. When I complained, I was told that ""equipment rental"" charges went up. Huh? Wasn't that part of our contract? What a slimy company. Consumer beware: COMCAST'S word is worthless."
"Timothy of Siloam Springs, AR",6/21/2015,,"I have had Comcast for almost a year now and it is the worst cable company. Their customer service is terrible and the employees are incompetent. We had an issue with our box for approximately 3 months and had a technician come out and replace the HD cable. That was a temporary fix while other problems had come up. We spoke to a manager to have our problem resolved and he scheduled us for a technician only to find out he never scheduled it. We discovered this after the technician never showed up. We scheduled another appointment and the reps mixed up our scheduled times so for 2 consecutive days we had no technician. Finally, we were able to get a technician to show up and he called the wrong phone number and then continued to sit outside our residence for approximately 15 minutes. To say the least, I would rather go without cable and internet than to ever have to deal with Comcast."
"Annonymous of Kansas City, MO",6/21/2015,,"I called late night regarding internet failure on Thursday June 18, between 12 am -1 cst. I was told that Tech Support does not work after 5. Really? They all swore no one could help me. The two service reps that responded to my call could speak clear English and they and I had to keep repeating simple things. They told me they don't keep notes on incoming calls from customers. What company does not keep records. I've been in customer service for over 30+ years, and would not talk crazy like that to customers. This is not 30 years ago... and even then we kept records of incoming calls. Anyway they insisted the internet failure was my HP Laptop. (6 months new) After the supervisor swore tech support was unavailable to get me back online and I needed to call during reg business hrs 9-5 pm... you could hear crickets. Finally I gave up and hung up. I ended up troubleshooting the issue based on what the Tech told me 5 days earlier when I lost internet connection. Anyway, I am now convinced Comcast is outsourcing and I was actually talking to reps in another country. Last time I had that issue I was dealing with T-Mobile reps in India. This is what outsourcing gets us. As Americans we are used to most reps trying to help. Anyway I called the next night, and amazing enough I was transferred to the non existing after hrs Tech Support department. The Tech advised me they are there 24/7. She helped me get back online. (And she spoke clear English.) The call lasted 3 min. Oh and Comcast has no 'Contact Us' dept. They give you the runaround when you click on the link. It keeps sending you back thru this loop.. I have yet to get completely signed up cause their webpage is telling me to use my pin. When I clicked on PIN, it rolled me back to payment system. I've got to admit the portal to making my payments works very well! Oh and you can't send them emails. But they have a forum where customers have to help each other. U-verse is looking pretty good now. If anyone knows of a way to get someone to acknowledge that customer exist from Comcast, pass it on to me. They have not earned any loyalty from me."
"A. of Manchester, NH",6/22/2015,,"Comcast seems to get a lot of hate, but I have never had an issue with them. I've been a customer on and off for the past 12 years, and my parents were customers before that. My spouse was in the Army so we moved every 9-36 months. We got Comcast for our internet (and sometimes cable and phone) whenever we were in an area that Comcast offered service. Every charge was explained beforehand. Any service issues were fixed within 3 days (usually within hours or even minutes). Customer service representatives were always easy-to-understand and helpful. Internet speeds are decent (I can browse the internet, have the kids watch Netflix, and my husband and his friend can World of Warcraft on 2 different devices, all at the same time with no issues.)Installation is cheaper than some other companies (we can choose to do it ourselves and skip the fees). They are military-friendly. We have had to cut our contract short a few times due to unexpected (less than a month's notice) moves, and we were never charged a fee. They even offer services/bundles without a contract, so there is no cancellation fee. When we last had to move unexpectedly a few months ago, we were even able to get our Comcast Xfinity Internet and Cable switched the same day! Comcast isn't perfect, but in my experience, I (luckily) haven't had any serious issues."
"Carla of Gadsden, AL",6/22/2015,,"I have called Comcast no less than 50 times over the last two months with the same problem. For no apparent reason, the internet modem will reset when a new device attached. After several attempts to watch this pattern, I begin to feel that this is an internal policy that is not disclosed to the public. I am now prepared to start a class action lawsuit to settle my complaints and go public with my assumptions. I ask Comcast to step to the plate now before it gets really bad. I have lost rapport with my customers because I am unable to connect to the internet 75% of any day. I have lost money because of losing rapport. My business has suffered. No I don't have business class as I do not operate a large business, but I expect to be able to access service at least 75% of the time I am forced to pay for it. I am so angry, I am having health issues."
"dennis of Philadelphia, PA",6/22/2015,,"So after 20 plus yrs and many many customer service frustrations including an offer to reduce my bill which in the end actually increased my bill by 40 dollars, I called because internet been off for 2 days. First foreigner I spoke to was pleasant and could read a script well but was no help after 30 mins. Transferred me to an American who say my 2 month old sb6183 modem was at its life end and the only thing I could do is get a new Comcast modem... A tech would have to come and install it (No doubt I would pay for that service) even though when you call the first thing they do is try to get you to fix it yourself... I cannot wait until fios is in Northeast Phila."
"Don of Brownsburg, IN",6/22/2015,,This morning I woke up to my cable and internet not working. I was wondering what the issue was about because I had just paid our bill two weeks ago. I called customer service and was told that we had an outstanding bill for $277 which seemed odd since our bill is $89 that was changed from $39 after we added our TV to the current contract 2 months ago. I had proof of my current bill which stated the new changes as well as associated monthly bill and it showed that we didn't owe any additional monies. As I write this post 6 hours later we are still waiting on complaint to be resolve and Our service restored. I have now reached out to utilities commission for assistance as well as starting the process of subscribing to a new provider because of the poor service that I have received from Comcast.
"william of Woodstock, GA",6/22/2015,,"We are new customers who moved to Woodstock GA. Comcast was the unfortunate choice for wifi/tv service in the area. I called on June 6 to schedule our service tech to come out on Monday, June 15. The customer service rep said that they couldn't schedule past Saturday, June 13, 2015. REALLY??? That's 1 week out!!! What kind of calendar are they working with??? We were moving in on the 15th of June, and would not be in the home for a tech to come on Sat the 13th. She said we could make the appt and then reschedule it for a more convenient time once we were moved in. Monday, June 15, we picked up the equipment at a store located 40 min away because we needed to have some kind of TV and Internet service at our home before a technician could come and do the official installation. At the Marietta Xfinity store, I received 1 modem, 3 cable boxes and no remote controls!!! The girl who gave me my equipment had the nerve to ask for 5 stars on her review!!! She should get 1 star for not verifying the total equipment she gave me!!! Canâ€™t turn on cable boxes with NO REMOTES!!! DUHHH!!! Tuesday, June 16, we had a Wifi signal that disappeared that night. We had already started service and now had NO SERVICE!!! I called and spoke to 4 different people, all of which told me different things. One rep said my service was cancelled. Another rep said to take the modem back and see if a new one would fix the problem. Wed, June 17, got a new modem and the remotes that we should have gotten with our cable boxes, and still NO INTERNET!!! I was asked for a service technician to come out and fix this problem and they said that the soonest they could get someone out was the FOLLOWING TUESDAY THE 23RD!I'm a BRAND NEW CUSTOMER and I would have to wait another week for service?? Come on!!! I asked for a supervisor to please see if they could rush this since I work from home and need access to internet service. They said they would ESCALATE the problem and I would receive a call from Comcast on Friday June 19. Someone called my cell from Comcast on Friday but DID NOT Leave a message for me. Sometime during Thursday June 18, we got a signal in our house to be able to watch 1 TV out of the 4 rooms. I also found 1 signal for the modem in a upstairs room that is not my office where my computer is located. Saturday June 20, we called and spoke to a few reps that said they would ESCALATE the problem again and that a tech would call me on Sunday, June 21 at 10:40am to let me know that they would be out to fix the problem that day!!!I was happy to hear that news... However, I was hesitant that anything would happen with this. The rep told me that since it was late in the day Saturday that they couldn't send some out and that Sunday June 21, there was a tech available. On Sunday June 21, 1040am came and went!!! NO PHONE CALL from Comcast. I called Comcast at 11:30 to find out what happened with the tech. A rep named ** said that the tech that was scheduled was the wrong one and that the rep on Saturday who told us we would be taken care of didn't have the authority to schedule a tech. OH and to add insult to injury, our appt that had been scheduled for June 23rd for 1 week now had now been CHANGED TO SATURDAY JUNE 27 WITHOUT MY CONSENT!!! I lost my mind at this point because that June 23rd appt was to resolve all connectivity issues I had since the beginning, and to properly install our cable boxes with the TVs in each room and make sure that we had a 4 way splitter so our rooms would all be Xfinity ready. All the while, no courtesy phone calls from Comcast to let us know whatâ€™s happening with our service. I called today to let them know that I would be cancelling service on Wednesday June 24th if they didn't send someone out before Thursday June 25 to rectify this bull crap. They supposedly ESCALATED me again and told me that I would get a call from dispatch within the hour to see about scheduling someone before Thursday the 25. Guess what, NO CALL and the escalation ticket was CLOSED OUT because no service tech is available before Thursday June 25. NO COURTESY call to inform me either!!!All in all, I don't ever want to do business with Comcast. They should be called Crap Cast, because all they give you is crap!!!! No follow up, a lot of lip service, bull crap lies about service being handled and just a huge debacle of MASS INEPTITUDE at its FINEST!!! I don't even know how the hell they stay in business!!! I was a happy Verizon FIOS customer in Pittsburgh, with not one single problem!!! But they don't offer Fios here!!! That's the biggest hardship for us!!! Comcast holds their customers hostage and they do nothing to compensate for their substandard service. All they keep saying is they will give us a credit for the inconvenience of the service not being done. There have been no credits on our accounts, only increases in the amounts we owe, which I will NOT BE PAYING!!! Comcast can kiss my butt!!! We will not be doing business with a company that keeps pushing its customers off into the abyss."
"romeo of Tucson, AZ",6/22/2015,,"I have a packaged subscription with Comcast for cable, computer and telephone services since January 2015. What I'm having problem is their cable service. Every time I go to their on-demand feature to select movies, the screen freezes up for ten minutes or so and keeps you from moving forward or backwards or scrolling downwards or upwards. They show you title of movies by a gallery type of line-up which is over 1,000 entries and before you reach the bottom of the line-up, the screen freezes up and you start from the beginning again (and I've been stuck sometimes for 8 tries before I finally reach the end of the gallery). I've called them about 15 times to correct the problem but they still are unable to fix it."
"Ms. Comcast Rep of New Jersey, Other",6/22/2015,,"""Thank you for choosing Comcast my name is **, how can I help you?"" Sounds familiar? Well I am one of the voices Comcast puts on their front row of the rants. We get the ""**"" and such. Can you just imagine the horror? Let me tell you about my job. We have three tools we use on our computer. One for troubleshooting, one for billing, one for creating tickets for complaints or compliments. (Duh we never used the compliment ticket) and sometimes these ** tools won't work. Comcast needs to freaking fix our tools. How the hell would you expect us to give 100% accurate information for the customer without getting to the page we want to? We have to put the customers on hold just to wait for the system to load...like, wtf?! We know what to do, we were trained well. And helping customers out would be more easier if the tools the headphones the internet speed and the ** SYSTEM LATENCY we have to go through every single day! And what the hell is up with the technicians making job orders complete without even really going to the customers house? What's up with the dispatch department rescheduling visits without even calling? You guys have no idea what we go through every single day. Our customers are none to blame it's the ** service Comcast has. Even customer care agents experience the nightmare Comcast has.TIPS FOR CUSTOMERS: ""NO SIGNAL"" - If this shows up in your screen, check your TV input using the remote that comes with the TV, not the Comcast remote. Look for SOURCE/INPUT button or a box that has an arrow inside it. Then highlight the TV option that pops us your screen. ""FUZZY / SNOWY PICTURE"" - Check wires to the box and the TV. Look for the the port that says ""video"" change wires if possible. Or even better, change the box - Comcast centers are open Mondays to Saturdays. ""REMOTE NOT WORKING"" - Go online on the Comcast website, click ""support"" at the top of the web page. Select ""program remote"" and follow the easy steps.""BILLS GO HIGH"" - Check the breakdown of the bills, if you see extra charges that you didn't had at all. Call Billing, ask for credit - all representatives have $60 credit for each customers. But make sure the dispute is valid. ""BLACK SCREEN"" - Power cycle the box, plug out the power cord from the wall, re-plug back in after 20 secs. Then send a signal using the Comcast website. ""XFINITY ON DEMAND NOT WORKING"" - Call Comcast ask for appointment quickly. ""CREDITS"" - Supervisors have $300 credits on each customer. ""MANAGER CALL"" - If you want a manager, we're not allowed to transfer you immediately. We have to attempt to fix the problem on our end, even our supervisors are busy talking to customers because Comcast never runs out of problems.I'm not saying this because I'm a rep. But guys, you have no idea how many customers tell us were horrible people, because of something we didn't do. Take it easy, it's always the small people who get stepped on and yelled at. I love helping out customers it satisfies me fixing their issues. It's Comcast is that wouldn't ** do their part of keeping their word and overcharging everything!"
"Christian of Houston , TX",6/23/2015,,"Do not get Comcast. They--this business is not recommendable, the internet is poor poor poor, channels are horrible, options and price is way too high. Be aware of this big American scam!"
"Deepak of Atlanta, GA",6/23/2015,,"I have been facing extremely slow internet connection and frequent disconnections for the last two and a half months. I have spent at least 10 hrs on the call to their customer care. Three technician visits and one scheduled, the trouble with service continues. Since I didn't get any internet they promised to compensate for the time and here they start malpractices as I should put it. Compensation did show up on the online account so I didn't pay anything for that month and I was at least relieved. But when I was to pay this monthâ€™s bill everything from the last month appeared back and an additional 70$ charge was mentioned for technicians visit.I did what any troubled consumer would do, I called their billing department. What happened on the call was shocking least to say. The lady on the phone kept on reading from the present bill and was absolutely deceitful & impolite. She kept on heckling me throughout the call and was venting spleen. After 45 minutes of discussion she offered me to take out the technician fee and told me to pay for rest of the bill even for the time when I couldn't use the internet.The conclusion is, cheating the consumer is not going to fructify and with a bitter heart I am saying that if you can't provide the services and solutions then don't promise to your customer. You exist because we are using your services. The day we decide to move away you will cease to exist. I leave the decision to the readers of this review to decide for themselves whether to back the unethical practices."
"Bradach of Marianna, FL",6/23/2015,,"Comcast is throttling customers internet speeds down by ridiculous proportions. I remember the day I signed up the speed they sold me was 25 mbps. They later made me happy when I got a letter in the mail informing me that my speeds were increasing to 50 mbps for no additional charge. What happened next shocked me when my speeds decreased to 3 mbps download speed. They told me that's what I was supposed to get, but they didn't know I was an I.T. Comcast is trying to pull a fast one of epic proportions. They are bringing us back to years to early DSL speeds. What they are doing should not be tolerated, and someone needs to do something about it."
"Josephine of Suisun City, CA",6/23/2015,,Being a customer with Comcast for many years and believing in the fact that they work with their customers is totally deceiving!!! They pretend they are helping you and put you on a contract without actually saying that you are in! I must say that I in believing that they are working with me got put into a contract so you can get out. I spoke to a customer service person and when I asked to speak to talk to her supervisor she came back on the line and told me before I speak to her supervisor that I had to talk to her again.
"Brian of East Brunswick, NJ",6/23/2015,,"I was told when I signed up for Xfinity TV, internet, phone AND home, that after I payed my first months bill, I would receive my Samsung Galaxy Tab within a week of paying my bill. I was told by SEVEN representatives that I was correct, I would receive it within the week. I called Comcast Rewards Department, and they informed me that I was mislead, and I will not be eligible for another 59 days. What kind of BS is that? I told them, ""I want my tablet by next Friday or I am cancelling service!"" and all they replied with is that they are sorry for any inconvenience that I am experiencing, and they apologize for me being mislead. I am furious!!!!! I expect to be told the TRUTH. Don't lie to me to bring me in as a customer, then go back on your word! I was even told by a representative last Friday, 6/19/2015 that I would receive a tracking number by today, 6/21/2015 and I would receive the tablet by Friday 6/27/2015. If I don't get it, I'm gone! And I will be posting reviews EVERYWHERE. Thank you for reading! I hope this doesn't happen to you."
"Nickolas of Brandon, MS",6/24/2015,,"Alright so for starters, I have 50 mbps down. I just replaced my router I think for the 5th time in a 1 year span. Still the same ** issue. I am getting 2-5 mbps with a few bursts of 40 mbps. These bursts last for about 10 seconds. I have an idea for Comcast. They should rename their company to Shitcast, maybe then people would not be so pissed about their ** service. Their ""Award winning customer support"" is all but that. The people on the line do not understand half the ** of what they are supposed to. When I am trying to do some things sometimes I will lose connection. Their customer support is god awful, and their servers double that. Whatever you do go with anyone but Comcast. Hell you prob will get more speed from DSL than Comcast Cable."
"Sonya of Atlanta, GA",6/24/2015,,"I called Comcast about why my internet bill has increased $250.00 each month. Internet. When I signed up for Comcast I was told my bill would not exceed a certain amount. And so I agreed. But each month my bill is higher than the amount. One representative noticed my GB were lower than they should be. When instructed to phone the Internet Customer Security Assurance Department, after holding for over an hour or more, I was informed that the rep was incorrect in telling me that my usage was capped incorrectly.And furthermore I was told that in my area, Comcast only offers a certain amount of 300 GB. On the online image of my account it stated 250 GB are what I'm presently receiving. I'm told by Comcast that my usage exceeds 1000 GB. But Comcast does not know why. I followed all Comcast steps and still my usage exceeds. This practice is unfair practices to customers. Comcast has the authority to charge overage fees but has no way of knowing how you are going over. Comcast should not charge until Comcast can show what exactly they are charging."
"K of Washington, DC",6/24/2015,,"I made an appointment for (free) technical service over the phone and confirmed it when called by their automated appointment confirmation line. No technician ever arrived. There was no communication from the company regarding technician status, no cancellation, no apology for the missed appointment, and no attempt to contact me to reschedule. I called asking how they would make it up to me and they said they would not charge me for a technician to visit at another time. In other words, they fabricated a service charge and then tried to use it as a way to reimburse me for time off taken to meet their technician.I asked for a $100 credit. A service technician is paid roughly $50 for a half day. I took a half day off and will have to take another half day off to meet a technician who may or may not show up. An account credit for $100, at their own low rate for that time, is logical and reasonable. I asked why the technician did not show for the appointment and why no attempt was made to remedy this or contact me and was told by the agent that ""there is no reason why. I don't know."""
"Melissa of Baltimore, MD",6/24/2015,,"I recently moved into a new place with my fiance and we needed cable and WiFi service and we chose Comcast. In the almost 5 months having Comcast I quickly cancelled my phone and cable package and switched to their super speed WiFi only, and I'll start giving you the facts as follows... it is very hard for me to type these for the rest of this will be without proper grammar. It was ok within itself to get contact Service Friday even installed when she barely two cable boxes and Service and you have to call them before three different time. The original court order the service my second call was a good week. After 2 weeks it will have received two cable boxes and the Triple Play package that they offered I was told ""Yeah that was the case."" One day actually came to install my service I only receive one cable box which time I called them to ask why I was minus one cable box to which I was told that I had only ordered one. This was clearly not correct.Afternoon it's worth of Service I decided to give it up the Triple Play and stick with just the super speed wifi. Shortly thereafter I called to complain about my WiFi service which was not up to this speed ever of which they said I was getting my pay for said Service. They sent outsend test my wifi speed how to make sure that my WiFi service what is indeed working properly. It was not working properly and the technician switched out my router for a better one. I was told there was two WiFi options I could use and down was instructed when one was performing poorly to switch. In our home we have 6 total objects connected to the WiFi service but generally only two of those at a time. Still at this point I was not getting the numbers I was told I was going to get as far as WiFi capability. I called and complain - they switched my Service and credited me $20. Gave me some cable channels but that's not what I wanted.So I call back and complain about the WiFi service yet again. The technician I spoke to tested it from their end and I was correct - it was not performing properly so an appointment was made to send someone out yet again today. That young man came out, switched the router, told me there were two - I could use one was for my smart TV and my laptop, the other for my phone and Roku. Till now I can only connect to that which she told me to connect my phone to the other one is not operating properly and when I called to complain about all of it yet again to a supervisor I was told I would get a $30 credit.Not only why they not want to do anything else but I was also told that on average my home uses more than double data usage than most home which I find very hard to believe. I am currently going to seek out some other form what company to help me and once my bill is paid I will get rid of Comcast for good although their customer service reps are very courteous and polite. I was in customer service for over 19 years and it's not just about being courteous and polite but also the service that you offer should be up to par and if it's not it should be corrected. None of which I received from Comcast Xfinity. I do not recommend them to anybody and I think that they are waste of time and money."
"Myeisha of Hyattsville, MD",6/24/2015,,"On June 22nd a payment was made to our Comcast bill via CC. The payment NEVER showed up on our account. We have called numerous times only to be on hold for an hour or more and then speak to people who barely speak English! Not to mention we were constantly told that a certain department could not handle an issue because of time or ability. Fast forward to today, 2 days later June 24th. I called Comcast and waited for 45 minutes and 32 seconds before I got the rudest and most disrespectful representative that I have ever encountered in my adult life! First I explain what is going on and she tells me that the confirmation number given to me is of no use because they don't use the confirmation numbers for anything. I asked her ""what is the point of a confirmation number?"" and she said ""I don't know and I have already told you that there is nothing I can do with it"". The conversation continues in that manner and after 10 mins she tells me she can transfer me to a Billing rep. I told her ""I asked you were you one in the beginning of our conversation and you said yes."" She replied ""I am not and have you spoken to them already?"" I said ""I have spoken to just about every department and no one can seem to help me, but the money has been taken from our bank account so we just want someone who can help us."" She replies ""I will transfer you because you don't listen"". Not only did she get rude, she hung up on me!I of course called back immediately. After waiting for 21 mins and 13 seconds I got **. She seemed to be more pleasant, but when I explained my situation and what just happened and asked for a supervisor she put me on hold for another 3 mins and 45 seconds (my phone has a timer) and then hung up on me. I still have not been helped and obviously no one at Comcast cares because they know they are the only provider right now in my neighborhood. This is very unfortunate and poor customer service. And I will do everything I can to get Verizon or whoever to provide service to our area!"
"Desiree of Hammond, IN",6/24/2015,,"Went into the Merrillville, Indiana Xfinity service center on June 9th, 2015 to set up Internet/Phone and TV service in our new home that we would be taking possession of June 17th. The first available appointment they had was for June 23rd between 8:00am - 10:00am. This worked great with my schedule as I work from home, and kept internet at our old house until the 22nd to ensure I wouldn't miss any work. I require internet to perform my job. I had the sales representative ensure me that there would be NO issue with my install on June 23rd. No technician came out during the scheduled time slot.I call in the service center and am told that my service was cancelled - prior to even being installed! I requested information into who cancelled the service. Not a single representative could provide me with any information as to why my install was cancelled/or whose fault it was. It certainly was not mine, as I had confirmed the appointment the night before. No resolution was provided.After speaking with 4 representatives to get a new time to install, I am given a supervisor who told me I would be scheduled for install that day later in the afternoon and that dispatch would call me to coordinate coming out. I did not receive ANY communication that day, the next morning June 24th I call first thing in the morning to see when someone was coming out to install our services. There is apparently no communication of my conversation with the supervisor or any communication of my rescheduled install.After speaking with 2 more representatives and them telling me a supervisor would call me back to address the issue, I instead went into the branch in Merrillville to escalate the issue face-to-face. I am told the earliest the install can take place in June 26th, 2015. Completely disgusted with the service, that nothing was done to escalate the install to be completed the next day despite the fact the error was on Comcast's fault, and that there was no offer to have any fee removed, discount applied or alternative solution to the dreadful service I received. This is, hands down, the single worst interaction I have EVER had with a service provider. At this time I still do not have a solution, install time nor have I received a call back from the manager I met with in the Xfinity store."
"Selena of District Heights , MD",6/24/2015,,On June 18 2015 Comcast turned my AC unit in my house down so far that it feels like the heat is on. I called and they told me since I didn't pay my bill they are going to turn the heat on and it's very hot in my home and have a sleep apnea machine. I been having problems breathing. I haven't been to sleep in four days. I will never install Comcast in my house again. I am suffering.
"SS of Smyrna, TN",6/25/2015,,Although we are writing here but there will be no effect. Comcast connection is very poor. Wifi always loses connection. Planning to move to AT&T.
"Michael of Elizabethtown, KY",6/25/2015,,"We have Comcast's Xfinity cable and high speed internet and for a while it was working fine. Then all at once the internet was insanely slow, and the cable TV service could not get a signal. We called and asked for a technician to come out, and they said it would be over a week. With me taking 3 online bi-term classes this is difficult. We decided to troubleshoot the issue ourselves while we waited and bought a cable, and bypassed different connection points on the line outside and inside, and found that the problem was with a 15 foot stretch of cable between 2 splitters. We told the technician where we found the problem in the cable line and asked for it to be replaced because that was the issue. He refused to replace the stretch of line and replaced a part of the line that was working properly instead.We ran the cable diagnostic test after he left, and discovered that our signal strength was the exact same as before. Needless to say we are furious. We called back and explained our concern, and they said I would be another week before they could send anyone to check out the issue. 3 weeks later now no one has been back and the connection is still awful. The cable TV is spotty and loses connection, and the high speed internet is running slow, or is not even working at all. I am a semi-professional counterstrike player, and I had to explain to CEVO why my internet wasn't working and why our team was forfeiting the match so it wouldn't count against our record. Long story short, Comcast please get your crap together. There is a reason you are rated 1 of 5 stars. And that's because we can't rate you as a 0."
"Tim of Raeford, NC",6/25/2015,,"Comcast has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Why does it take 20 minutes to schedule an appointment? Every time they come out to the house there is always an issue and it seems they have to reinstall an entire system every time they come. I pay over $250 per month for the worst service. Now they are saying they won't work on the system because there is a safety issue with the electrical system, but the electric company came out and verified there was nothing wrong. I am looking at alternatives."
"A. J. of Tallahassee, FL",6/25/2015,,"This is my first time writing a review for any company but I feel compelled to in order to prevent unknowing customers from going through what I went through. I signed up with Comcast Feb 27th with a plan that would cost me $100 dollars a month (cable, phone, internet). My first bill was twice the amount $200. I called to inquiry about this and they told me they charged a month in advance. I didn't sweat it. My second bill (which should have been around 100 something dollars) was another 200 and plus dollars. I couldn't understand why my bill was twice the amount I had agreed to... The horrible customer service representatives kept telling me about fees that made absolutely no sense. They charged me for equipment packages that I never received or inquired about. They charged me for home visit to fix the internet disconnectivity issue, which I was told by a rep, would have been free. By mid May, that month's bill was close to 300 dollars. So within less than 3 months... I accumulated a bill over 500 dollars... when the initially agreement was 100 plus a month. Not to mentioned that I had called their reps, who gave me a quote of 224 after I canceled my service in May. I have the written conversations with me and then after my husband returned their equipment, the last rep I spoke with told me my last bill was 198 and couple cents after they adjusted all the overcharges that had grossly charged me in the first place. Lo and behold I went to pay the final bill of 198 dollars that the rep told me. I owe only to see 287 dollars and couple cents. I called back the company furious to find out why I was told my final bill of 198 after returning the equipments only to be greeted by almost a hundred dollars increase. Needless to say, I was beyond furious. Needless to say, not a penny will come from me. Had someone told me about Comcast price gauging practices and extremely poor customer service, I would have never used them to begin with... it was after the fact I found out about other people's similar experience with this company. A person relayed to me that one guy had Comcast and they charged him 200 dollars deposit because other people who used to live in his apartment didn't pay their bill. By this guy's third bill, he was charged 600 dollars in one month alone. Please find a more reputable and trustworthy company to do service with -- one that doesn't price gauge and break their contracts. It's more than a matter of time before a class action lawsuit is filed against this company and I am willing to be a participant any day any time. Please save yourself the money and trouble.. NEVER use Comcast/Xfinity. It's just not worth it."
"Steve of Port Huron, MI",6/25/2015,,"Our service went down 8 days ago and a Comcast service tech came out to our office to see if it was our equipment. He stated that the lines were messed up on Comcast's home office end. We got service back up after a few hours and the tech said he tried it and all lines are working and trunking to each other and no voice mail is on them. After he left we received complaints that our customers couldn't get through and we found out only one of our lines was working all the rest were not. Now have been working was their customer service which shouldn't be called service at all. It's a joke same as their supervisors. We have lost $1,000's of dollars and Comcast could care less. If you own a business do yourself a favor and don't consider Comcast!!!!!"
"rodd of Stafford, VA",6/25/2015,,"Called Comcast this morning to report continued noise/interference and dropped calls on phone line that is getting worse. Service was out about 2 months ago for same problem on cable. It took over 20 minutes for tech to answer the phone. ** finally answered and I explained problem to him/her. He went over schedule to get someone out to repair problems. He warned that Comcast would charge a fee to have a tech come out if no problem was found in their equipment. I complained about the last tech saying the amp was too high and causing the noise and a loose connection, but did not resolve the problem. He either hung up or was disconnected, but never called back!!! Comcast is the worst service ever! Please send FIOS to my area! No order number issued, he hung up!"
"adena of Bryn Mawr, PA",6/26/2015,,"I have been having problems with Comcast on demand for a long time. Items scroll and literally choose themselves. I have looked at programs to watch, and it will buy the item just by clicking info on it. I let most of this go. I have even paid for programs I did not order on occasion because customer service is so difficult to deal with. Last evening I tried watching a video and it came up that I needed to contact CS for billing. This was midnight. If you call the number they give you on the screen, you are told it is not during business hours and you need to call back. If you go through the entire menu and push other areas, having to do with paying your bill, all of a sudden there is a live person to talk to. I will not make any politically incorrect statements but CS reps are unable to speak clearly. Do not know the language. The first person verified me quickly, told me I had reached my video credit for the month! And needed to put in for EXTRA video credit for me! He hung up on me after I was put on hold for 10 mins. I called back and as the rep who answered began I could hear this other person in the background talking! I told her what happened, and all of a sudden she said I was not a verified user on the account! I have always been for 12 years. She insisted I wasn't. I asked for a supervisor. He got on after 15 mins and said I wasn't a verified user. Both reps told me I could go fly a kite pretty much for all they care. Today, I called to find out what the issue was, and lo and behold, I am of course a verified user, and it seems there are tons of orders for a program we never ordered, but they insisted we did. Comcast used to be wonderful. It's horrible now."
"Nicholas of Lynchburg, VA",6/26/2015,,"If I could choose lower than one star I would. Absolute worst internet I have ever had. One minute it works fine then next it doesn't work at all. Every morning doesn't work, sometimes loads up to 50% then stops. Apartments need new choices besides Comcast."
"Greg of Auburn, WA",6/26/2015,,"I've been complaining for months about slow internet around 1 to 5 mbps and not able to open emails half the time. Finally they agreed to send someone out after I went and got another modem from Comcast and bought a new wifi router and still no improvement. The day before they came out, I was getting 3.34. The day they sent a tech, I was getting 25 to 60 mbps. I have a history on my speed tests every month for years, and they haven't had that speed for over 6 months, except the day the tech came out. They have been throttling my account. It's so wrong!!!"
"Virgil of Grand Rapids, MI",6/26/2015,,"One year after moving in our bill jumped by about 30%, thus, as one might expect, my wife called and asked what specials, etc. The non-English-speaking person stumbled through numerous insanely confusing offers. My wife simply stated that we liked what we had, but did not like the pricing. She was told that another one year renewal would keep all channels as they were and yet maintain the old pricing. UNFORTUNATELY NEITHER PROMISES WERE TRUE! We lost half of the channels and the price did NOT go down. What a con. We called again today some months later and were told that the only way to get the Hallmark Channel (one of the many we lost) was to pay $40 more per month for the one channel!!! Comcast is a CONCast. We are moving in a month or so and I will NEVER go back to these cons again. BUYER BEWARE."
"Ric of Addision, TX",6/26/2015,,"We recently sold our home. As a result, we needed to change our service(s). I wanted to keep our current email address for a while and get rid of the services no longer needed. ie TV, High Speed Internet etc. The service at Comcast was borderline abusive. First, I called 5 times and could not get anyone. I then tried their 'Request A Call Back' service twice. No call ever came. Finally, I tried again and got through on the 6th attempt. After getting a real person, I told her that I wanted to downgrade my service to minimum required to keep only my email addresses. The rep tried (and I counted them) to sell me an upgrade to my service 8 times. Even after I told her that I sold my house and didn't need their service anymore. She ignored my requests for a reduced package and continued to try and sell me an upgrade. When that didn't work, she tried to get me to transfer their service to our new address numerous times. I told her that we already had a different service in place at the new location. And then after all of that, she still tried to get me to refer our relatives to Comcast.net. I found Comcast to be a very, very poor quality company with even worse customer service. After this experience, I would not refer my worst enemy to them."
"Angie of Plantation, FL",6/26/2015,,I called and cancelled my service because after 20 years with them I was tired of all the price hikes. They sent me a label to return the equipment and I returned it immediately. I paid my bill. I am now in collections because they do not recognize the other cable company and the copy of the new service date. So now I have collection against me for service; when I have documentation that I was with another provider. They have lived up to their reputation of below poor customer service.
"tanya of Chicago, IL",6/26/2015,,"I don't appreciate being hung up on by a manager after being on the phone for over 6 hrs trying to fix a mistake one of the salespeople made on my account at the Jefferson park location last night. Last night, I went in to get all new boxes since every box I have has been giving me problems and to rent a router (Whatever I need for wireless internet) because the one I have is a bit slow. The bag I was given had 3 boxes. I just assumed they were the two for my tvs and the Internet box but when I went to install everything, I realized that third box was just wires, not the router thingy. I figured there was just a miscommunication but I then got a confirmation email that listed my monthly fee for the modem I never received.Today I came home and seen that nothing was working so I called customer service. MY FIRST CALL: I talked with two girls who were pretty nice and explained to me that my service is going to a different apartment in my building.. Not mine! Somehow while switching my boxes out and forgetting to give me my router this lady also changed my apartment number. They said they changed it to the correct apartment and put me on hold while they were checking to make sure everything is working. THEN I got disconnected. Now they have my phone number, so why would they not call me back?!SECOND CALL: I asked to be connected with the lady I originally talked to and was informed there was no way of doing that, so I went on and explained my whole situation again only to have the guy not understand. I asked to talk to a manager. Then got hung up on. THIRD CALL: I talked to ** who was super nice. She was not able to do anything. I then spoke with a manager named ** who was also super nice and understood the whole situation. According to her, she was able to fix everything. Everything was working fine.. for about 30min!FOURTH CALL: I asked to speak with a manager several times but for some reason this lady seemed to think she could fix it all. After she realized she couldn't do anything and after wasting my time, she said she'll have a manager call me. FIFTH CALL: The manager called, I explain everything again. She informs me that everything is going to a different apartment and doesn't understand why I WOULD CHANGE MY APT NUMBER IF I DIDN'T MOVE. I had to explain to her that I haven't moved and have no plans on moving several times. She spends about 45min sending signals through to try and get my Internet to work but she's still not understand she's sending them to the wrong apartment. She says I have to deal with a different department tomorrow. I asked since I have her on the phone ""can we go over everything on my account just to at least make sure that's correct because who knows what else the lady last night may have messed up."" So I'm telling her what I'm suppose to have. She ignores me and says to deals with the people tomorrow. I ask again about going over my account and she insists everything on her end is correct and there is no need to go over it. How do you know everything is correct if you don't even know what exactly I'm supposed to have??? Then she hangs up on me! What kind of business is this!? I'll definitely be switching service providers tomorrow!!"
"Ashley of Detroit, MI",6/26/2015,,"I am the landlord of a home in Concord, CA, and my tenants and I have received some of the WORST customer service from Comcast, from the start of their service to the end. My tenants moved in on 9/1/14. Of all of the service providers in our area, they chose Comcast as their cable provider. They called your sales department to request a technician to come out and install cable and internet service. The earliest appointment available to send out a technician during the week was over a week later. When the technician finally arrives to set up their services, he saw my home was wired for cable, he located the box on the exterior of the unit, yet he said he was unable to locate a live wire, or the main box where all of the wires within the unit are routing to/from. He was also unable to properly communicate to us why he cannot find live wires, and the steps we needed to take to get the cable and the internet turned on. His quick fix response was to run wires along the exterior of the building, and to make another appointment. We make an appointment and request another technician, because your support center stated the wires in the unit are live and ready to turn on and we are not sure why the technician was not able to turn on the service. Three days later, the same technician arrives says the same thing and leaves. We make an appointment and request another technician. A new technician comes out on (9/15/14), and also cannot find a live wire, and tells my tenant in order to install cable in the unit, and to move along with the process your landlord needs to be here and needs to bring a signed letter of approval, so Comcast isn't liable for any damage to the property while trying to get the services turned on. I move things around on my schedule and arrive for the next appointment (9/17/14) with the signed letter in hand, the technician then stated in order for them to start wiring the unit they need my HOAs approval. Now I have to go down to the property management office and request they drop everything their doing to draft up a letter of their own because my letter is not sufficient enough on its own.Even though my home is not a part of a renter community where requests and complaints can be answered 24/7, I am proud of the level of service I am able to give my tenants, and it is my duty to make their experience in my home a pleasant one, especially since they are paying rent to be there. My tenants deserve the same level of service they're able to get at any apartment complex. As many times as I have rented out my unit, and dealt with other cable companies I have never heard of this issue, or had my time wasted just to have a technician come out on 4 separate occasions to NOT install the cable. The bad customer service given by the technician, and your support team, not only reflects poorly on you, it reflects poorly on me and my unit. This tedious debacle of a set up job, for something that should be so simple has pulled me away from work and other tenant requests. Anyways, the technician did not want to bury the wires as I requested, he said that your company wouldn't do it, and that he could run the wires along the outside of my unit to get the service turned on. Since my tenants had been through enough and the technician assured me that the wires would not be visible I allowed for him to put the wires on the outside of my unit.Fast forward 8 months later when I am actually able to get back to my unit to see the work that was done, I was very upset to see the awful job the technician did to get the cable & internet turned on. There are black screws and black wire all along the side of my cream colored house and my light brown front door. I would like to know why your technician wanted to run wires along the side of my house, instead of burying the wires as I requested, when you have a department that comes out to bury the wires? I called your customer service department on 5/18/15 to request a technician come out to remove the wires from the side of my house and to patch up the holes that will be left behind. Customer Service stated they would send a request to a local technician in Concord, Ca and that the technician would call me within a few hours. I wait a day, and then on 5/20/15 I call back and talk to another customer service rep who says the same thing, someone will call me back, and she gives me a ticket number. I again wait a day to receive a phone call, and NO ONE calls me. On Friday 5/22/15 I call back. I request to speak to a supervisor, because maybe they can explain to me why no one is calling me back to handle my request, and they can then expedite my request, since I have been ignored for 5 days. 1) The rep wouldn't put a supervisor on the phone. 2) When I finally convinced them to put a supervisor on the phone, the supervisor was not helpful and he put me on a long hold. 3) When someone finally picked up the line again I had been transferred to SALES. The first thing I ask is ""What department are you in and did the supervisor explain to you why I am calling and why he transferred me to you?"" The sales rep had no clue why I was transferred but still tried to help me. (** was a ROCKSTAR!!!) She was very competent, very helpful. She even called me back to give me my ticket number since her systems were down at the time I called. Even though my complaint was not 100% her department she opened up a new ticket on my behalf and made sure I was contacted to get this wire removed from my home.Saturday 5/23/15 I received a call from someone who was going to help me. I was very excited, but the second I told this rep that I didn't care if Comcast buried the wires or removed them, they quickly said ""Removing wires isn't our department. We would only be able to bury them."" And she quickly transferred me back to customer service.I was so frustrated I demanded again to speak to a supervisor, and again I wasn't given a supervisor. The rep on the phone took down all my info again, and put in another request under my same ticket# to have someone contact me. He claimed that someone would call me by the end of the day at the earliest and within 24 hours. I said ""Are you sure, because it's Saturday and Monday is a holiday?"" He said ""Yes for sure someone will call you."" It is Wednesday 5/27/15, and I have not received a phone call, or a missed phone call, an email, a voicemail NOTHING! I am so frustrated and fed up with your so called customer service. This is ridiculous that you pay these people to LIE and MISLEAD your customers. They make a lot of claims and nothing comes from it. Is that really what you are paying them to do, just answer calls, and PRETEND they're doing something? Or is it your technician offices fault because they do not answer these requests in a timely manner? Whatever the issue is, you need it corrected ASAP. This is ridiculous that I have to waste my time calling, and pleading, and now complaining, about your customer service.PLEASE CONTACT ME AND PLEASE HAVE SOMEONE COME OUT TO MY HOUSE AND REMOVE THOSE AWFUL WIRES from the side of my house. And I have decided that as of now none of my tenants are allowed to use Comcast in my unit. If this is the nonsense they have to deal with, and now I have to deal with. This is unnecessary stress because you pay so many people who don't want to do their jobs.Update: Comcast decided not to help remove the wires or patch up the holes, so they passed me onto their insurance company, since they couldn't or refused to get anyone to come out to fix the work. Thanks for the extra hurdle to jump over comcast. I do not understand why anyone bothers with your company."
"Sameer of Bloomington, IL",6/27/2015,,When we moved to another address we closed the Comcast account and our online access to our account was ceased. They didn't even send paper bills and we were charged with late payment unnecessarily. Not going to use Comcast services again in my life.
"Jordan of Houston, FL",6/27/2015,,"I cancelled my cable service about 8 months ago with no issues. I kept my internet service and just used the basic channels that I received by plugging directly into the wall. Several days ago the channels I was receiving were encrypted to prevent me from watching them anymore. I decided to get my Comcast television back. I never returned the cable boxes when I originally cancelled my service. I was told by several different customer help technicians that I could use those same cable boxes and everything would work properly. After the negotiations of price for the products and refinancing my house to pay for it, I purchased basic cable and internet. The customer help department sent out signals to the cable boxes that I had. After several attempts I was still not receiving a signal. After talking to several different people (because I kept getting disconnected), I was told to go to the closest Comcast building and swap out the cable boxes. The first 9 people that I talked to were from some other country that spoke broken English and had a thick accent that I could not decipher. Once I was able to talk to an English speaking representative that knew more than what was written on a cue card, they explained to me that after so many months without use, the product becomes inactive and can't reactivate it. I drive to the closest Comcast building and explain what happened and they were very polite and helpful. I came home to set up my equipment and hooked everything up as instructed. I called the number that was provided to activate my equipment. One of my cable boxes accepted the signal and began working right away. The other one was unsuccessful. I contacted customer help again which was short lived due to being disconnected again. Once again I contacted customer help to have the lady on the phone attempt to send another signal to the device. After the failed attempt she thought that she could send the signal again and fix it. After several failed attempts of sending the same signal to the same device, she finally recommended I return to the local Comcast building and exchange this device for another one. I have had more hassle dealing with this company as a whole in the last 48 hours than I have with any other business over the course of 10 years. Most of the employees that you talk to on the phone don't know what they are talking about and can only read whatâ€™s on the cue cards in front of them and/or speak broken English with a thick accent that keeps you from understanding what they are trying to tell you. I suggest stop contracting this service to people in the Philippines and use United States citizens that speak fluent English and have a working knowledge of the company. Take pride in your company and the people you hire. The majority of your employees do not have a clue on how to help you solve the problem that you have, no matter how simple it may be. So after paying 75$ a month for a service that only cost me 30$ four days ago, I am contemplating leaving this company as a whole and making sure that all the people that I know and come in contact with on a regular basis hear my side of the story in an attempt to open their eyes."
"Karen of San Jose, CA",6/27/2015,,Comcast service techs come out to perform work and do not wait to confirm it is repaired. 8 hours off of work to be there for two tech visits and both times the repairman left and it never worked. Customer service has been unresponsive. Policies for consumers are different depending on the call center you reach. Never received call back from service manager and still not repaired and have lost all previous recordings due to swap of box. Customer service rates as the worst I have ever experienced.
"Tina of Kennesaw, GA",6/27/2015,,"I was not aware I was in a promotional contract. Rep said NO when I ask if it was going to change. After a year it jumped 30 per month. When I called to fix it they acted as if they did me a favor and took me to 89.99 per month plus about 30-35 in random fees on top of that. Rep said he would prorate bill from the 109 it jumped to per month down to the 89.99. Well he never did that and my bill became past due (paperless bills and makes same payment each month via autopay) - my service was shut off. Automated system said 53 dollars was past due. I paid it immediately and assumed the rep wrote off all but this figure. Fine I was ok with that. Service was just turned off again 2 months later. They said 29 was past due --- ok??? So I paid it thinking I missed a movie I ordered or something. This was yesterday.I go online to my account and it shows 134 past due. Ok!! I'm calling them. The first rep sounded as if he was napping and could barely form his words. He kept repeating himself about my account and just offered a premium channel for my inconvenience. I hung up and called back to tell the whole story again and that rep put me on hold and another rep picked up as if I was a new caller. I asked to please be sent back to the person I was just talking to. She transferred me to someone NEW again. So I tell the story to 3 different people and this 3rd rep would only repeat policy and tell me my past due amount. I said ""Can you please look at notes where your coworker TOLD me he would adjust bill from where it jumped to 109 per month down to the new 89 per month."" She said ""Well he was not supposed to do that and he can't. I said ""Well he DID tell me that so how can we fix it."" She said ""We can't.""I asked to speak to a supervisor and she was typing with her and ALL the supervisor said was ""You have to submit disputes within 60 days... etc"". I told them ""This makes no sense that you can't help a customer fix what YOUR employee said he would do!!"" Absolutely NO customer service at all from Comcast. They just said I need to pay the 134 past due when NO ONE could tell me why it was 134 past due when I paid the 53 dollars past due 2 months prior and they SAID that brought me current. So basically we have to pay whatever amount they put on there with NO explanation and NO help from the ""customer service reps.""In my line of work you do what you can for the client. If someone gives them the wrong info we stand by what the person told the client and we FIX it. I am stuck in a contract and forced to pay a past due amount that NO ONE will tell me why?!?!?! I may just bit the bullet and pay the amount to take my service elsewhere. Comcast customer service is the worst. I guess they think because the Internet speed is faster than most that clients have to put up with script reading from reps and NO help!!!"
"Christina of Murfreesboro, TN",6/28/2015,,"My husband and I are paying $30 more a month now that our 1 year agreement is up & because I won't sign up for a 1 year contract it will be $30 more each month. This is the only service for internet in our area and it has been the worst service I have ever dealt with. It interrupts what I am doing every few minutes to tell me that the Ethernet has stopped working and needs to find the problem, or the internet freezes and I always have to reboot the computer. I am done with Comcast and I will make sure not to move in an area where I have to use this service again!! Comcast, if you want to keep your customers satisfied, lower your rates because the way things are going these days people are taking different approaches to watch tv and fix the internet problems."
"steve of Stockton, CA",6/28/2015,,$1500 in installation fees. Waiting two weeks to get installation done and nothing but the runaround from you guys. I have got nothing but bad service from you and equipment failure over 6 times with my modem and business from your end.
"Maggie of Maple Valley, WA",6/28/2015,,I have direct payment to Comcast. I trusted them to be fair and honest. Recently I noticed I have been almost double charge for years. I asked them to credit and resolve the problem. They refused. I asked them to cancel my services based on the fact that they have no reason to charge me $205 a month when my bill is supposed to be 130... They said if I cancel I would be charged $240 additional.
"Chris of Dallas, GA",6/29/2015,,"In May 2015 I agreed to upgrade to the X1 platform at the rate of 159.49, with no contract. Since the upgrade my bill has never been the correct amount. It has gone up. Also since installation the service has never fully worked. It will freeze up and black out. Some of these have been due to Comcast working in the area and others there has been no explanation. I have had to switch my modem out once already which has not fixed the problem of it not assigning the correct IP. I have tried several times to talk to someone using the 800 Comcast number but get bounced around departments or told that there is nothing they can do. I am at the point to disconnect all my services and find another option due to the utter lack of ownership of the problems I have had. I tried to have a technician come out and check the original install of the X1 and was told that they cannot schedule techs during an outage and that I would have to call back later. This is ridiculous. I would like to speak to someone who can actually fix my problem without bouncing me to another department where I have to start over from the start. But I am not sure that there is anyone who cares about the customer more than they due the money."
"Sallyann of Peabody, MA",6/29/2015,,"I ""updated"" to Comcast blast about a month ago. Since then my WiFi is at a CRAWL and that is saying it nicely. There is no way I am getting the promised speed. Dial up was faster and of course, no answer from Comcast. As soon as I figure another service out this company is out for me. They should be sued for false advertisement."
"Melinda of Saraland, AL",6/29/2015,,"We just had Comcast Xfinity installed 2 weeks ago, and after one week my cable, Internet, and house phone all went out. After about 7 phone calls speaking to different people, 2 supervisors, and 1 manager I still cannot get an exact date for a technician to come out to resolve the situation. I have been given nothing but the run around, and bad customer service!!! We had a scheduled visit on the 5th day from 5-7 and the technician never showed up. When I called at 7 to see if they were coming, the girl on the phone told me that the technician had contacted them and reported the problem resolved. They told me that he would be reported for his behavior, but could not give me another date and time when another tech would be out.After another hour of being on the phone with customer service all they can tell me is that I have a new ticket that has been upgraded to emergency status and sent to the dispatcher. They told me to wait another 24-48 hours for another technician to call and give me a new time to come out. If they can't find a tech to take my ticket, it will be July 6!!! That's another week with no service!! Oh, by the way I have 3 children and it is their summer break!! Thank you Comcast!!! I know this is a long story, but I just want to let people know what you will be dealing with before you change your service!!"
"Fernando of Salt Lake City , UT",6/29/2015,,"I upgraded my service so I could see the fight of Mayweather. So I got billed two months after the fight and my bill was over $400 dollars. I guess 100 was for the fight which was fine but $100 to upgrade my service, hundred dollars for the installation and they had two modems when I had only have one in the bunch of other things just irritating. Can't wait for my contract to be over and switch services!!! I will for sure never recommend Comcast to any of my friends or coworkers."
"chris of South Bend, IN",6/29/2015,,"In Late April, we moved from one side of town to the other. Because of this, I had our Comcast service (the triple play package) transferred from our old address to our new address. The representative I initially spoke to checked on the new address and said that the previous residents had Comcast and that everything should transfer over just fine, for the most part, everything went off without a hitch with one exception, our cable television never worked. From then all through May, we had been calling customer support, trying to sort out the problem with the service after 3 or four calls on several different occasions, the last representative told us that we should schedule for a service technician to come out. When we tried to do that, we ran into a whole slew of issues: when I called and tried to explain my problem, the representative that I spoke to, didn't seem to know what I was talking about, so she proceeded to put me on hold for 20 minutes. Then I had to explain everything to another rep, who told me that their system was down and that she wouldn't be able to verify my information. I was sent to another department who I had to explain my situation to for a third time, and this woman insisted that the systems were down, but that she couldn't verify me as an authorized user on the account... just to list a couple of the MANY things wrong with this on top of her apathetic tone and uninterested responses - how exactly could I authorize a transfer of service without being verified on the account? By that logic, either someone at Comcast allowed an unauthorized user to move my service, or she's refusing to grant service to a paying customer. I told her that if that was the case, then it sounded like the security of my member account was in jeopardy since any old person could access my account and start making changes to our service. And then I followed up with, ""now, do you want to check the notes on my account to see if my verification is in there or do you want to give me someone that will fix my problem?"". Stammering over her words, she transferred me to someone in member services(?) who was immediately rude to me, she told me that I wasn't a verified user on the account. I explained to her that I just had my service transferred from one address to another last month using my name and information, and that, the information was probably just never moved to the place she was looking, and that I was sure it was in the service notes. She refused, and I explained to her the whole bit about the contradiction in not allowing me to set up a service visit, which I had done at the old address, but allowing me to transfer service, which would have to be somewhere in my service history. I would like to note, that I also had to ask this woman, very politely, to stop interrupting me while I was trying to speak, and from her voice, she was getting upset. She asked me if I'd like her to transfer me to another department, and I told her that I'd been transferred 3 times before and that I'd like her to solve my problem, to which she responded by hanging up on me. Now, I've been at this location, for a month+ and my at&t cell phone service is exemplary. No drops, no low signal, not even a buzz or a crackle. The call did not drop from my end. For a customer service representative to hang up on a customer because they won't move to another section of a file is unacceptable. I know it's a no-brainer to get the information that they needed to verify my authorization because I asked them to check for it right where it was, and I know this because after cursing at my phone for 2 minutes, I called back, and explained my situation to another representative who calmly listened to my recounting, apologized for the OTHER people's mistake and then told me that she'd found my verification. I waited 25 seconds for her to do that. (I will say, that it was clear from her intonation and her speech pattern that she was an English speaking US national, and at the risk of being politically incorrect, my first representatives' inflections suggested that they were somewhere in the middle east or India. This, however does not excuse their treatment of me; if you're not going to do your job, you don't deserve to have it.) I exclaimed that ""that was fast"", and asked her where she'd found it, she calmly replied, ""oh, it was right here in the notes."" This person not only went through some troubleshooting steps with me to verify my problem, she completely calmed me down and got me the service appointment I had initially called to schedule an hour+ before. While I didn't get the names of the people that I'd spoken to before, and as I understand, they wouldn't have been their real names anyway, upon request, I did get their service initials. They are as follows: ** for the first, ** (or ""O"", we weren't sure which) for the second, ** for the third (gonna leave that one alone) and ** for the fourth and last woman who hung up on me. The name of the Godsend who I got at the end was **, and her service initials are **.I took the time to write this review in the hopes that someone at Comcast with some pull actually reads these and will do something about it because, seriously. FIRE those first four people. I NEVER want to have to deal with their likes again. I think it's a smudge on Comcast's reputation to even have people like that employed. They made me so upset and frustrated that I went out of my way to put in the extra effort to get the information to back up this post. I want them held responsible for their poor performance and treatment of their customers. And for a last piece of advice, please, please, promote ** so that she can do some good in your company, or at least give her a raise. I promise you, that I was willing to cancel my service and never return if that last call hadn't worked out. I'd had an offer for At&t internet in the mail 2 days before, and there's Dish equipment already installed at this place. ** really saved you guys our $90+/Month."
"JANICE of Hillsboroughj, NJ",6/29/2015,,"I have been having internet connection problems for the past 3 weeks. I keep calling, they reset my box, they send out a technician, he tells me to upgrade my box. I go get a new box, I'm still having connection problems. I now call and am on the phone for 2.5 hours with 5 different people, not one can help me. Another service tech is coming out this Thursday. No they are not. I'm cancelling my service and going with AT&T."
"lizdaris of Waukegan, IL",6/30/2015,,"I had a previous bill with them and they send me to collections - 1400 dollars. I call and I wanted to have a new account, so they promise me to start me up with a 0 balance. They call me and say ""yes, 0 balance"" 3 times before they then came. I ask again if it was going to be 0 balance, they told me again yes. On the same day of connecting the toll, me: 0 balance. Well when the bill came in it was for $528, so I have call - spend over seven hours on call and now they tell me it was a previous balance that was not paid. I ask them, still no help with this. So why they tell you all this and set you up for failure again?"
"James of Memphis, TN",6/30/2015,,"On June 6, 2015 I called Comcast customer service for help with internet service. At the end of the call, the CSR who gave her name as **, gave me a sales pitch. ** told me I get increase my internet speed for only $7.00 per month, and it was a 30 day trial period during which time I could cancel at any time and not be charged. I asked ** at least five times if it was only $7.00 per month and that I could cancel at any time and not be charged. She said yes. I was also told I would not be charged the $7.00 until the end of the 30 day trial period. I said OK.On June 16, 2015 I went online to look at my Comcast internet data usage for the month, and found that my bill had increased by $17.00. I called Comcast customer service - billing - and spoke to **. ** told me part of my increased bill was due to Comcast price increases that go into effect on July 1, 2015. ** told me that $11.42 would be removed from my bill and that she has no idea why ** told me a $7.00 price. I told ** I wanted to go back to the exact service I had. ** assured me she would take care of it.On June 20, 2015 I went online and Comcast still had not corrected my bill. I called Comcast billing yet again, and spoke to **. ** said it was in the system to remove $11.42 from my bill, and ** assured me it would be taken care of. On June 30, 2015 my bill still has not been resolved. My bill has never been paid late. My bill is due tomorrow. How can any company be so incompetent? I really don't think they care. I am getting ready to switch to DIRECTV for TV, and AT&T for internet service."
"April of Hudsonville, MI",6/30/2015,,This is absolutely the worst company I have ever dealt with. I spent 4 hours trying to resolve an issue. In the process was told that my banking information that I gave to a phone rep was never received but that I should trust them with it again. I was talked down to numerous times by a manager. I missed family time to try to resolve this and at the end of the night I have no resolution and I had 2 hours of chat transcripts of me going in circles. One rep actually tried to contact the department that I was trying to get a hold of and ran into the same situation of being in the queue for 20 min and then kicked to a random voicemail due to waiting too long. This is ridiculous.
"Robin of Fort Myers, FL",6/30/2015,,"After filing a complaint with https://www.fcc.gov/ & better business bureau I received a call and was credited for my entire account less the 150.00 I paid in advance. I am satisfied with these results. It's sad I have to go to these lengths to correct issue. ** Executive Office Number! If you need it but no help unless you file a complaint with link above. Then you will see results.Original ReviewSigned up for X1 Blast package not quite 2 weeks ago. Was told install was free & I would not receive a bill until 30 days after I started my service. I was told install tech would be here the next day between 5 & 7 pm. I was given my phone number and paid my deposit for all 3 service.The day of the install I received a call saying something went wrong on their end and they would have to reschedule my install for 2 days later. I was not happy with that. I was able to get the next day instead, so I was ok with it. They had to run my deposit again. I confirmed that the phone number they gave me was still going to be the same as original they gave me. I explained I was ordering new card & t-shirts with the new number and wanted to make sure there was no chance of the number being different. I was assured that the number was the same. So I placed my order.The next day when tech showed up I was informed that the number was a different number! After about 4 phone calls and almost 3 hours on the phone with I forget how many different operators trying to get a supervisor, because the operators did not have the authority to correct the number. I just spent 1000.00 on my order! I could not change it due to a mistake on my end. The Supervisor was able to correct it! I was very happy.Not even 2 weeks go by and I get a email from Xfinity saying my video bill was due???? So I watch it and I'm thinking maybe a tutorial on my video bill. WRONG!!! IT WAS A BILL!!! I had a bill over $200.00. It is only supposed to be 112.00 including tax a month. I was charged an additional 39.95 for the installer to show up and 40.00 for hooking 2 cable lines to 2 box's 20.00 a box! So install was 89.95. My house was already wired and ready. I was also charged for half a month's service and tax. I called and was informed that the info the 1st operator told me was not true that they always bill 2 weeks after service and I would get another bill in a few days for a full month service. That on occasions they do offer free install but it was not in my notes. So there was no chance of getting that removed from my bill. I requested that they pull the recording of my conversation with the original representative. I was told it was possible that it was not recorded. HMMM... Imagine that!!She said she would put in a request for her manager to remove the $40.00 but the manager was off till Monday, it was Friday. I was also told that if it was removed it would come off the next bill statement not the current one. She recommended I pay it all now. That the next bill may be adjusted! She said she would call me Tuesday to let me know the decision. It is now Saturday and I have already received another email telling me my bill was due AGAIN! I just got the first bill yesterday! It is not even due till for another 10 days! I am awaiting the call on Tuesday. Will update this on outcome!"
"Beth of Ligonier, PA",6/30/2015,,"I don't use Comcast's Cable TV services because of the constant problems, but have had good wireless internet connectivity until a few weeks ago. Endless menus and waits to speak with customer support people who then follow long troubleshooting protocols that had tried many times, ultimately ending in transfer to wireless support. Although usually these people are usually neutral-to-pleasant, and I've been speaking with tech support people for roughly 18 years without problems, I got a hold of an obnoxious, patronizing, offensive wireless tech support person today. Of course, Comcast pays a lot of lip service to wanting to provide customer support, but it took another half-hour to get through their phone system again and to be connected with a series of supervisors simply to report this kind of treatment. Comcast is a massive monopoly and it appears that if we want service, this is what we can expect to have to deal with."
"Adrienne of Alpharetta, GA",6/30/2015,,"Comcast Overcharged me and by taking out $250 out of my account and has not refunded me yet, additionally I have no working service. I have spoken to over 20 reps and no one will help me resolve any of my issues. Everyone continues to tell me what the procedure is, even though it was their error. They are ok with me being out of money, causing my account to overdraft and having no service for the holiday weekend."
"Dusty of Oakland Park, FL",6/30/2015,,"If you are in need of cable, internet, ext. DO NOT USE COMCAST. I signed up for internet, home phone, and cable through them in March for what was suppose to be 126.99 a month with 4 installation fees of 15.99 added on for the first 4 months. I have now paid over 800$ in 2 months and I have a 700$ bill sitting in front of me and my TV is now turned off because I have not made the payment. So I tried to call them to get them to adjust payments and they said they had no specials running for that price and basically told me I'm wrong. They have no notes. They have nothing. I have spent 10 hours over the last week or so trying to get this figured out and they still have done nothing to adjust payments. Not to mention it took 3 hours just to get through to someone to speak with before they transferred me over to a supervisor and got disconnected. Rated #1 worst customer service and I can't wait for them to come pick up their crap! They absolutely suck and I would not take the time out of my day to sign up for this and write a review about how horrible they are unless they deserve it which they do. Do not use Comcast!!!"
"Elena of Coral Gables, FL",6/30/2015,,I called to express my surprise and displeasure with receiving 23 declines for Comcast service ON THE SAME DAY. Apparently their internal systems do not capture this data AND it is my issue of THEY flood me with fraudulent requests. When I asked to speak to a supervisor? I was refused. SO GLAD I cancelled them 2 years ago!!!
"Vera of Bellwood , IL",6/30/2015,,"Comcast is the worst customer service in the country. My bill is different every month. I sign up for the 54.99 plan. When I get the bill it's 3x that. And when I call they say ""oh that promotion over. There are no deals."" And the HD boxes that they said would be free for 12 months... you're being charged for those boxes. Thumbs down for Comcast."
"pam of West Palm Beach , FL",6/30/2015,,"July 26, my services went out. I spoke with numerous representatives that all told me different information. Finally once I was able to talk to an supervisor they explained to me they were going to create an expedite ticket which would have an dispatcher try to get someone out to my house before my schedule date which was today. Well no one showed up and the technician lied and said he came to the address and fixed something outside, which is a lie. No one came to this address. Also I spoke with another supervisor and she sent a request for the technician to come back to my address. Well he did not come and I was promised a supervisor would call from the dispatcher office. Well no one called back. Now, they are saying I have another appt Wednesday which is July 1st. I have been without phone service for over 4 days. I am highly upset with this customer service."
"d of Boston, MA",7/1/2015,,I have never had a good experience with their customer service. Always long wait times and are never helpful at all. I would never be a customer if I had a choice but they're the only provider in my city. Worst company ever!!!
"Roberta of Davenport , FL",7/1/2015,,"We pay good money to have cable, internet, phone, with Comcast Xfinity and the service is always going out. I would like to understand why there are always problems! Anytime we call, they tell us they are working on it but there is nothing they can do for us. Meanwhile 6 hours later, we may or may not have cable. I'm mostly upset because they don't care about the customer. I was with Bright House for 5 years, never this many problems. But I can't get Bright House here, it's a shame."
"Zandra of Suite 5G, FL",7/1/2015,,"We requested a transfer of business service weeks in advance. Days before our move Comcast cut off all our services (internet, phone and fax lines). We called multiple times and each time we were told that it would be connected immediately. A week has gone by and no service was ever reconnected. Not even a call from any of the supervisors we left msg for. The actual day of our new location installation no one showed up. We called and spoke to over 10 different people, left msg for multiple supervisor and even spoke to corporate customer service. And not a thing. We are a small company that has suffered greatly because of the lack of consideration and customer service of Comcast. We will be filing a complaint with the FCC and the BBB. Our company has lost potential clients and our customers have also suffered."
"steve of Lake Worth, FL",7/1/2015,,"My TV and internet went down Sunday June 28th about 6 pm, thunder storm in area. Went out that evening, came back checked, rebooted a couple of boxes nothing. Called Monday morning and advised no outages reported, must be our home. Only appointment Tuesday 1-3 pm, I am working. But if I do not take this, Thursday 3-5 pm. So kept appointment. Got a call later Monday morning from Comcast asking if I still require appointment as ""outage"" should be repaired by 10.30 am! I let lady know I was advised no outage, but she confirmed outage so cancelled appointment. 10.30 am came and went, nothing. Called, told 6.20 pm... 6.20 pm came and went nothing. Called again. Told outage was a ""4"" whatever that meant, and should be resolved by 10.20 pm..... Yes you guessed, nothing.Tuesday morning, called, still advised of outage.... watch this space. No TV or internet all Tuesday. Wednesday morning, called, told there was no outage!!!!!!  Priceless. Explained to MORON, that several people had told me otherwise. Call did not go well. We ""lost"" connection. I called back, spoke to lady who told me about my appointment on Friday between 8-12 noon... news to me. She wanted to ""help me"" by having me reboot, unplug plug you know the drill. I explained I had done this on several occasions. I told the lady Comcast is a complete farce. Called Corporate Customer service. Expect no joy. So right now investigating options with Directv (consumer reports doesn't show them much better) and U-Verse (even worse). Isn't there a cheap Chinese Company we can sign up for??????"
"Octavian of Renton, WA",7/1/2015,,"So, before I made an account with Comcast, my roommate had one, but he was using my original Comcast wireless modem/Router but from Amazon more than a year ago. Router perfectly fine. He had to move out, so he cancel his and I open my own account. After I opened mine I couldn't set up the TV but the internet was working fine, even though we had some trouble after a couple of days. So I called them, and they said that I'm not the only one in the area having problems, and it's a server a so, so they have technicians in the area to fix it. So next day was up, I assumed they fix it, but next day was off again. My TV didn't work since day one... So I was about to cancel it, but one customer service representative convince me to let their technicians to come by my house and set everything right. So they came a few days after, when my internet was up again, and was up in the past days. They fixed the TV, and check the internet, which was fine. I was navigating with my laptop at the same time. But the technician decides to swap my router with theirs free of charge he said, so they can register online with the right upc code. So I was fine. Now Comcast charges me 10$ a month for the router after they got mine... I talked with them for 1 hour and 30 minutes, even with a supervisor and they would keep repeating same things and sending me to buy another router or continue paying for theirs. I told them that wasn't me, who mistaken, if I would've knew, I would had my own router which was just fine, and won't accept theirs, but I took because the technician said it's free of charge, that's why I even allow him to take mine. I saw it as an exchange. Now I lost a router that I paid for a year ago, and pay for the ""rented"" one they gave me. Long story short... nobody cares about my loss, and they won't fix anything for me..."
"danny of Villas, NJ",7/1/2015,,"I work for a manufactured home developer and was asked to contact Comcast to have an existing underground cable line lowered just several inches to allow for installation of a drainage line. Every day for six working days in a row I was promised someone would be there to look at the problem but no show, and no call. One day I was told someone would be there by 6 pm. I waited in the rain. No show no call. I was transferred, hung up on, told I need to stop talking and answer their questions first before I could speak with a supervisor, transferred to India or Pakistan and told to be patient by someone twelve thousand miles away. I have to say that I swear on my children's heads and everything holy that the truth is, in my younger days I have gotten better customer service from my drug dealer."
"Evelyn of Mount Dora, FL",7/2/2015,,"Internet service off and on for last two months as of the 29th of June. No service for 3 days, July 2nd 2014. No realistic eta on resolution. IVR keeps stating a time frame of when services can be up and extending it. Reached out to local office tech supervisor in Lake County with no response. Reps are rude and disrespectful. When asking for a manager they state there is no one available. No one has answers or keeps you informed. Even for a compensation of credit you have to call to inform for it to be documented and then call back when the service is back up to get credit. I have no service and I am treated rudely and unfairly. I am told I have to deal with it and wait without knowing when I will have service. This is not an isolated issue. This is a power failure in my area for the last two months they have not been able to fix."
"Thomas of Swedesboro, NJ",7/2/2015,,"Lost cable, internet and phone on June 18th 2015. Was told by numerous reps that someone would be out to fix it. Today is July 2nd and still no one has fixed it. Everyone from customer service disconnects me on the phone because they have no answers. Worst service ever."
"Andrew of Toms River , NJ",7/3/2015,,"I have Comcast Service at my home in Florida, as well as in New Jersey. Customer service appears to be outsourced, and attempting to explain a problem appears to ""suffer in translation."" I am now having problems in New Jersey, after attempting to deal with a problem in Florida with minimal success. I cringe at the possibility of having to call a Comcast representative again to resolve a problem. Shame on you, Comcast, I am not impressed that you just got your name atop an iconic building in NYC. You should be focusing your efforts on BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"
"Oscar of Miami, FL",7/3/2015,,"As a Comcast customer for internet service, which I have no complaints to date, I decided to change from DirecTV to Xfinity cable. They had an attractive bundle pricing that included cable and decided to take advantage although I had a bad experience years back with their cable service. Installation day however resurfaced past bad experiences. Although my house is pre-wired, my choice was to move their internet wireless modem to one end of the house - the signal is weak as well as expose wires throughout the rooms. Otherwise they would have to run additional wires in the attic at an additional $100 per line to change the current modem wiring they had installed. In the end the installation cost far outweighed the savings from the bundle. Finally when I asked the technician to remove the outside wire he had installed, he left over 20 U nails all over my yard."
"Lindsay of Minneapolis, MN",7/3/2015,,"When a promotion ran out in March, I got a different service package because it would be cheaper than just having the Internet and now instead of just the internet, I have cable as well. I didn't want cable, I told them I didn't even want them to send me the box, but they said it was really my only option and now the cable box is happily in my closet where I never look at it. So my building is old and apparently the Comcast boxes here are old as well and don't work as well as they should. As a result my internet is down intermittently. I didn't have the internet for the entire month of June.Today the service technician from Comcast came and fixed it. However, when I called Comcast to be reimbursed for the time I spent without the internet, they stated I could only be reimbursed for the internet portion of the bill that I was paying. So my bill is currently 54 dollars a month and they reimbursed me 27 because I did not have the Internet. But they will not give me the other 27 dollars because that is for the cable that I never wanted and never use. So last month I ended up spending 27 dollars for literally nothing. Up until now, I have had no problems with Comcast. I think they're shady as hell with their bundling practices and promotions, but necessary evils and all that. So here you are Comcast, for the low, low price of $27, you get yet another negative review on the Internet. I suppose at this point, you're using them to wallpaper your offices."
"Dennis of Fayetteville , GA",7/4/2015,,"I have been without cable and or On Demand off and on for 6 months. Every time I call we go through the normal procedure, send signals, unplug the cable box, unplug the TV etc. usually it fixes the situation. On Demand was out for a month at one point. When I get a customer service representative that I can understand their English we do make some headway only until it rains or thunders again. I have called this week alone 6 times only to get it fixed last night to have it not working again today, they tried to set an appointment for next week but I can't do that due to traveling Monday through Friday. No appointments available for today and they can't make one for next Saturday due to they don't have the schedule yet. They asked that I call back Wednesday to attempt to get an appointment next Saturday.. since when did the burden of customer service get put on the consumer to take care of repairs and technician appointments? I really wish that the government could get involved against Comcast. I read your satisfaction rating, it's horrific, and any private business would be out of business if they handled customers and customer service as horrible as you do. I called to cancel my service only to find out its in my wife's name, who is in Europe, so she has to come back and do so. For what Comcast charges and what poor service the customer receives, the customer support should be impeccable ."
"Sherri A of Silver Spring, MD",7/4/2015,,"Every time I get a bill, I have to check it. Comcast has raised rates repeatedly without notice and in amounts of 10-20-30-40 dollars. They always have some excuse-rate changes, equipment costs, home tech visits even though no tech visited my home. Now they want an increase of almost 40 dollars in one month. They also are able to get apartments and commercial businesses in Montgomery County MD to use only them, eliminating competition with the tenants having no choice of using other companies and the businesses getting kickbacks."
"Tommie of Ellettsville, IN",7/4/2015,,"I recently went through a bad medical issue. End result I had an artery attached to my aorta blow up and now I have an aneurysm. There's nothing I can do about it except for, stay calm, no emotions. If it ruptures I'm done! Now for the last 9 months I have had crappy service and from the first call I told them I think cable was old. I'm sure I don't have to tell you how many times I've called or how many boxes I have exchanged or how many times someone came out, how many times I have been"" disconnected"" and had to call back and start over again with a new person who may or may not understand english.The last attempt was running a new cable across the road until someone comes to install properly, which I was told will take 3 weeks. We still have problems with on demand and wifi. We all know if you need to stay calm, Comcast would be the last place to call. On the other hand when I try and watch a show on on demand or use the wifi on my tablet I want to blow an aneurysm! I have paid extra for extra boxes to watch on demand and I have just about put all of my precious time into getting what I have paid for that I'm going to. But that sucks! Xfinity, the highest speed Internet you can buy! I bought it but can't use it. These are despicable people! I now have to decide, do I just save myself the stress and live without TV and Internet (because there are no other choices) or do I spend what could be the last months of my life fighting with comcast? Hmmmmm..."
"Ramkumar of Bloomington, IL",7/4/2015,,"I got a call from Comcast customer survey and was asked if I was satisfied with my service. Since there was so many drops in connection recent days, I replied that I was not satisfied and told about the problems why I was not satisfied. Immediately I was offered with a new package which I was told would have a better performance. No information on why the service I had was degraded.  Having been a Comcast customer for 3 year, I asked him if he could switch to the new plan without any contract. The reply was ""Yes sir, we could switch to the new plan."" To confirm I asked again ""Could you switch to the new plan without any contract."" I was not given an answer and this guy hung up the phone without any response. He did not even have the courtesy to say whatever I asked is not possible. I am not willing to continue with Comcast anymore. Reasons: 1. Service quality is not as advertised. 2. So many disruptions. 3. Customer care does not provide clear and open answers to questions on billing. 4. Finally, rude guys in customer service."
"Elizabeth of Fairfield, CA",7/5/2015,,"I recently called to downgrade my service with Comcast because my hours were cut at work. I explained my situation to the Comcast rep who sold me a downgraded package with a cost quote of $110 and told if it didn't work out, I could cancel in 90 days. Well, I got my first online billing (but no actual PDF of the bill) which was $154 not $110 - At the next opportunity I bundled up my equipment and went to my local office to cancel the tv service; however, I was told by the office rep that I only had 30 days to cancel, not 90 and I would have to pay $240 to cancel my service. She refused to cancel my television service but did take my equipment. Now I have no tv, but I'm still being billed because they are refusing to honor the 90 days or to cancel my service. How can they get away with this?"
"Chryse of Atlanta, GA",7/5/2015,,"Lesson learned: There is no Emergency Phone Number for hanging cable lines in the street. When you phone with an Emergency, you are not transferred to an Emergency Department. The nice Sales Lady told me there was not an Emergency Department. To her credit, she recorded my complaint and did give me a ticket number. I'm at least the third person to phone Comcast for help.I recommend not getting involved with Comcast as they don't take responsibility for their own lines. Last year, one of their lines fell at my house. My neighbor and I phoned them repeatedly and nothing was done for more than 3 months. The only reason the line was finally removed is a Supervisor happened to be working my street one day, my friend saw him, explained the situation and the Supervisor removed it. It should not take more than 3 months for Comcast to remove a line hanging down into the street from a telephone pole.Monday, June 29, 2015 another line fell and is hanging from two telephone poles. One pole is on Bentbrook Drive, the other is on Lakeside Drive. Both the Power Company and AT&T tell us the line belongs to Comcast. Two neighbors reported this down line and nothing has been done. I called today and am waiting to see if anything is done. This second occurrence of a Cable line hanging. It's been 6 days with no response to the previous multiple requests for help. A situation like this should be resolved within a few hours at the most, not months or days. They can process someone's payment in seconds, but refuse to take care of their own equipment for extended periods of time."
"Mary of Boynton Beach, FL",7/5/2015,,"On the 4th, we watched TV as normal, then left the house for a short time. When we came home in the late morning, 2 Comcast trucks were working on the box. In the house, no services were working. Eventually, everything came back on but one TV. So we called. They can't come and fix until Tuesday, and the trucks outside were doing ""routine maintenance."" I called again to see if we could get an emergency appointment. I was hung up on. So I called again. This rep told me he was escalating the incident and gave me an escalation number. He said I would receive a call within 2 hours and took my cell number. No call back came, but when I returned home, I had 4 missed calls on my home number from Comcast. I called again today. The rep said that I would not have received a call back and that those 4 calls were related to another matter, but she didn't know what it was. She told me my issue was probably with my TV and that they could not assist. Fed up, I asked to speak to a supervisor. After at least 30 minutes, the supervisor Jason from the escalation department came on. He said that they cannot get an appointment any earlier than Tuesday. Then he tried to go through the entire troubleshooting exercise that we had already gone through 4 times. He told me that I was being uncooperative because I wouldn't do it again and that he had nothing to offer me. I asked if I could speak to his boss, and he said there is no one above him available to speak to and that he is it. So here we are with no TV in the living room and 20 people coming over to watch the World Cup final tonight. I sent a message to the customer service center. I have no hope of getting this fixed in time, but I would like to have the terrible service addressed."
"beego of Awfe, Other",7/6/2015,,"They promise you a certain download and upload speed, and the vast majority of the time it's a fraction of the speed they say it should be. I tried to check my download speed, and the website won't even load. By far, one of the ** companies in the world and I hope Google Fiber starts getting to more cities, because Comcast is ripping us all off of our money and ** us up the ass in the process with their overpriced rates."
"Ryan of Gresham, OR",7/6/2015,,"I worked for Comcast for about 6 years. I also stood up for Comcast every time someone said they hate Comcast, I would say ""you hate your monthly bill not actually Comcast"". I had a great experience with Comcast while I worked there other than getting screwed out of disability pay when I had a Dr suggesting I take time off. This however was the old insurer's fault and not actually Comcast but still they should have stuck up for me. I also got screwed out of commission many times because of someone messing up an order just like my own order kept getting messed up below.The reason why I am writing this is because of the experience I have had transferring my service. On June 18th at the service center I asked to discontinue June 21 and install July 18. Got home and service was discontinued (happened all the time I worked at Comcast because of poor training and System flaws). Called to activate service, hour later back on. Called the 22nd to make sure transfer was correct and I was told tech turned on service at new home, this is not right because I need a tech out July 18th to install because customer has had satellite service the last 3 years. Rep couldn't change because system had an error. Got disconnected. Called next day and order was put back in for transfer and again no install but active service 18 days too early. Said ""please cancel"", they said ""it's done"".Called in again few days later and another order for transfer was in the system. I got frustrated and said ""cancel everything"". They said ""ok no problem"". Week later called and once again I have active service on another order to transfer. I asked to speak with supervisor 10 times and wouldn't allow me then she said ""I can't make changes because I can only pick up equipment."" This is after I have called in to make changes 10 times for this transfer and the other times before this transfer. I got so frustrated and hung up. Finally today I was able to remedy this problem (I hope).So the many people that say I hate Comcast is because of the constant screw ups that are caused by reps that want commission, don't want to lose commission, and just don't want to help if they don't make a dollar. Comcast's customer service will forever be flawed by this system and culture of reps. I spent 10 phone calls and 8-10 hours on a transfer that should have taken 15-30 minutes. I cancelled service and will not stick up for you anymore."
"Lu of Scotch Plains , NJ",7/7/2015,,"I received the promotion mail from Comcast stating they provides $29.99 per month for 12 month for internet up to 25 Mbps for new customer, expiring July 14th, 2015. I was so excited since I will move in to a new apartment on July 7th, 2015. I have called the number on the promotion letter @ 1024698. After 40 minutes on the phone with one representative (she was trying to get all my information and sell me to the package which I do not need), she told me they cannot offer me the package stated in the letter. Instead, they can offer me $34.99 per month internet with only 3Mbps. I was very frustrated but decided to call the number again (giving them another chance) to talk to another representative hoping he/she treats customer better. I asked him whether he can give me the price as stated in the promotion letter. The answer is straight no with no apology. I told him what I am going to do is not going to be Comcast customer and will write a review. He does not care. Here I am writing the review... Hoping you see it and now understand why Comcast is not a good business and losing its market share: dishonest and not caring their customers at all."
"Boz of Buffalo, NY",7/7/2015,,"I cannot begin to tell you the issues I've had with this company some 5 yrs now. I too have had customer service calls over the phone, useless fixes, this and that and techs - it is constant. I cannot believe this government has not investigated Comcast for fraud. It continues to draw customers in with their unworthy services that do not match the updated technology of our desktops, laptops, phones, etc. They know it. I was discussing it with my current computer company Rep who worked for them. He was not shy about what goes on there. It very clear that profits are what matters to these unethical and greedy companies fueled by profits. Forget about you, because we're the chumps that have no choice and they know it. If this is what our future looks like, good luck, because there is something bigger ready to squash you like the creepy crawlers you are."
"nancy of Downers Grove, IL",7/8/2015,,"For a year, I can't streamline a television program or even play more than one song on Pandora radio, why? My internet speed is too slow to do anything! I have DirecTV on Demand and can't watch anything. Every time I call, the tech person switches me to a different internet channel, which works for less than 24 hours. A woman came to my door advertising the new Comcast fast service so I signed up. They put new cables in the ground. It's worse than dial up from the 90's. My double play bundle is 98.90. This is for one landline and slow internet with BLAST. MY sons tells me it's like the old party lines. They put too many households on the same line. I just called billing and told them I wasn't getting what I'm paying for and he switches me to tech. I had a tech guy out to the house last month. He walked around outside and again switched my channel. My speed went up for 24 hours only then back to the snail's pace. So much for false advertising, soliciting at your door, and getting help. They know what they are doing! After being on hold for 20 minutes I was transferred to a disconnect line and just heard a dial tone."
"heidi of Circle Pines, MN",7/8/2015,,It takes a very very long time to the talk to a person. They sent me the set up package. It should be easy since they don't offer someone to set it up like most companies that care. I follow the directions and nothing works. I called and they wanted to charge me 40.00 to have a tech come out and 40.00 for a new port. The guy on the phone was no help. So in the end still getting charged and no cable.
"Veronica of Memphis, TN",7/8/2015,,"First incident happened in April 2015. My first service package expired. I renewed my package by choosing a more inexpensive package with a 2 yr contract. I am on a fixed income, I was trying to stay within my budget. Comcast charged me not for the package I choose 109.00 mo, but for the package they chose that cost 215.00 mo and charged me 30.00 returned check fee for a check I had on file, that they never presented to the bank. I contacted Comcast and the rep admitted the check never was presented after I stated, I can get proof from my bank. Therefore I told them to send the check to the bank for payment. When I received my bill the next month showing credits, they did credit back the 30.00 return check fee, received their payment from the bank as agreed, but the charges and credits were so crazy. I do not know if the credit and charges are accurate. ""Life goes on"".Now let's go a little further. I set up a postdated check with Comcast on 6/17/15 for 6/27/15. Their policy is ""if you have a check on file for the past due amount, your service will not be interrupted"". Well I return home on 6/25/2015 service interrupted. I immediately call Comcast. The rep stated he do not know why they disconnected my service, because he do notice a check on file. Rep apologized and reconnected service. I advised the rep, ""I would like to cancel the postdated check and do a debit transaction, in order to prevent anymore issue with Comcast or my service."" He transferred the call.I explained the situation again. The rep took the debit card payment with the understanding that the check will be deleted. I stated ""If I give you these funds now, make sure you do not sent that check to the bank, because the funds will not be available, because I'm releasing those funds to you now"". The rep assured me the check will be cancelled. My ex-spouse was on the three-way with us. He ID himself and gave her the credit card information. He asked the same question, the check on file will be cancelled. Rep replied again yes. I received confirmation for payment and terminated the call.I called back on the 6/27/15 to make sure check did not go to the bank. Rep said there is no check on file. All is good. I checked with my bank all is good. I thought this was the end of it. I make a deposit with my bank on 7/6/15, I return home to find a NSF reminder in the mail. I pull my bank account up online and noticed the bank retrieved funds from my deposit for the amount of the check plus a NSF fee. I immediately call Comcast advised them of the situation and they gave me the run around from dept-dept. I was hung up on, on several occasion. I actually stayed on the phone about 3hrs trying to resolve this situation. The reps was of no help, requested a manager was told there's no managers on the floor, they would have a manager to call me back. (A call back I never received.) Was also told that they do not have a resolution dept to assist customers.Therefore I log into ""My account"" on the Xfinity website. Rep are actually techs, but were able to get them to transfer me to billing and customer service. I received the same crap. Was on chat for about 2hrs. Continuously repeating my situation. Finally, the next day I go to the local office here. The Manager there was no help she said for me to call billing or regional collections. I advised her I tried all of that. I asked what is my recourse from this point. She continued to say there's nothing she can do and I need to call billing. At which time, I asked her for Corp office phone number. I did receive the phone number.Once I returned home I called corp immediately, which is Comcast Executive Customer Relations Dept. I explained my situation, I was told that once you put a check on file, it cannot be deleted nor cancelled. I explained to the rep, ""if that's the case then the rep should have never took my payment with the understanding those funds would not be available if I give her a payment now"" (which made that check null and void) and the rep stated verbally she understood and that check will be cancelled. I could have left the arrangements as is. It would not have made sense for me to give her that payment, if I was told the check would not be cancelled. Rep said he would get back with me.I did receive a call later as agreed, I was told the only thing they could do was credit me bank the NSF fee to my bill, I said that's not acceptable, because it has caused a domino effect to my bank account, defamed my character with my bank, because I do not have NSF on my account. Comcast reps have misled, misinformed, gave me erroneous information and went into my account unauthorized. Not to mention the mental anguish and wasted time. This has actually caused me issues with other creditors and overdraft fees, because it was too late to cancel other postdates and debit transactions. Remember I'm on a fixed income. I have no way of paying these fees or charges to my bank. The bank will charge per day after, fees are not paid within a certain amount of time. Do this mean eventually my account will be closed and the bank will send collections after me and list it with the 3 credit bureau? This is a nightmare. Still waiting on last phone call from Customer Relations, if no resolution will go from there."
"L'Oreal of Philadelphia, PA",7/8/2015,,"Charged my account one month in advance, then suspend my services after they get almost $200 last month (June). How do I have an overdue balance if I paid over $400 within the last 2 & a half months? COMCAST IS A COMPLETE RIP OFF! NEVER AGAIN!!!"
"kay of Denver, CO",7/8/2015,,"I paid my bill in full on the due date for 139.91 They only credited $57. When I called them they said that when I signed up for double play (they requested a deposit of $100 for equipment), they say they credited the additional $87. For double play, they are doing funny business. On July 6th the bill was $139.91 which was paid in full, Now they want another $87.00. Why no valid explanation, or trail for the billing? No other company makes up bills with no tracking. This is from my bank showing payment POS Withdrawal.

"dan of Williamstown, NJ",7/8/2015,,"I called Comcast 6 months ago and agreed to their package Deal, 89.99 for the triple play; my bill was suppose to be after surcharges and taxes 118.00 every month but from the first day we received our bill it was 160.00, next month jumped to 190, then went down to 177, then jumped to 275, 201, and 245. We calculated our bill with corporate office and had 5 payments of total of 905.00. After figuring out that Comcast owes us a credit of 65.00 and admitted that the reason my bill was so high was because they put in a hd box and have been charging us for the last 6 months their services we didn't have and also for a dvr which we don't have. After all said and done they are saying we owe them 587.00 still and will not turn on my service until we pay a past due of 247.00. When asked to speak to someone higher the lady said there is no one higher and it was pointless for me to try and speak to another higher than her; I then while on the phone with her called the corporate office and asked if I could speak to a higher person and they put in a request for my bills to be looked at properly but would take for another person to call me back 24 to 48 hrs later. I've been on the phone with them for 2 days now trying to get this situation worked out but still now have to wait a extra 48 hrs to get help. I don't work for Comcast. I shouldn't have to sit on a phone and try and fix my bill that they screwed up. My bill should be 0 as of right now they see it. They did the math but refuse to say they overcharged me and was their mistake. If you do the math it doesn't add up. Will update status after I get final results; it's ok to be wrong. Everyone is human. Just fix the problem not looking for a handout or anything extra. I just don't want to be robbed and it seems at this point they think they can do this just put service in and tell you what you're going to get when you didn't ask for it nor ever used it. Comcast we are your customers. Do you even value our business? This is why you lose so many customers. It starts with us and ends with you. Fix the problem Please."
"joy of Plymouth, MA",7/8/2015,,"I have had problems with Comcast forever. Speaking with representative is useless and getting things resolved is frustrating. Recent conversation dealt with moving out-of-state, no service provided but yet charging term fee! Avoid!!"
"N H. of Houston, TX",7/8/2015,,"I have been Comcast customer for 5 years since, and have been ok until I added home security service. I signed for a bundle package which looks pretty good after signing up. When my bill came it was not like what I signed up for. When I called they tell me different story. I was very upset and told them I don't want this service and would like to cancel. They told me if I cancel they will charge me $600 just for cancellation. So I continue with their service. Every month the bill goes higher and higher. I called them to explain to me, they said ""oh it was a mistake"" and they credited and the same thing happen again and again. At last I spoke to one person. He change my bundle and gave me his promotional code and told me my bill will be $99. I got relieved thinking it will be. For one, two months the bill was ok. After that they started charging me again differently and my bill shoots up again. I have to call them for every billing cycle. Now they started billing me 3 bills in a month. On May 4 I paid $121.73, and they have charged May 31, $200.56, June 02, $200, 200.56, June 03, 201.64, June 25, $169.16, July 06, 201.64. Then they cut off my home security and said that I have a bill due June 29 $169.16 which they have already received on June 25. Then I called to find out what happen. The customer rep I spoke to told me that ""your service is pending for disconnection because of the overdue payment of June 29th."" When I told her when the bill was paid and I told her I would like to speak to the supervisor she then transfer me to supervisor. I was put on hold for almost an hour still the supervisor never answer the phone then hung up the phone. This is how Comcast Xfinity makes money from customer. This is ridiculous. I have never heard in my life for cancellation of service you have to pay $600. I guess it's high time Comcast should treat their customers properly. I have never written a review about anything bad but I have to write this because I am very unhappy and in fact angry with their service."
"Liso of Springfield, MA",7/8/2015,,I think Comcast are con artist and there should be an investigation because they tell you one price and make it easy till you get the high bill. Also they charge a month advance. Then if you move they charge 2 month in advanced. I think they are gold diggers.
"Yane of Oakland Park, FL",7/8/2015,,I called to get double play. The lady signed me up for triple play. And was never informed. I believed until I called to pay and now they want charge me the same amount. Horrible service.
"Michael of Brandon, MS",7/9/2015,,"This is the worst service I have ever had. My wifi is always offline when I am at home trying to work, but get up in gone morning at 3am and all is good. Comcast service is the worst I have ever had. You want payment, I want good service."
"karen of Toms River, NJ",7/9/2015,,This has got to be THE WORST internet service EVERRRR. So slow. Have Chromecast and the Movies have to reload every three Minutes (that's being generous). It takes like five to ten Minutes and I have to restart. Takes like three hrs or more to watch a normal length movie. To search the web... also takes more than double time. I usually turn off wifi and just use Sprint which also sucks but NOT AS BAD AS COMCAST!! That's sad. Your internet sucks and cable costs way too much. Unfortunately it's my only choice. Can't wait for fios to be available. :-) :-) :-)
"russell of Modesto, CA",7/9/2015,,"After learning Comcast was the only internet company available in my area I was immediately distraught. I've followed consumer advocate groups as I am picky with who I do business with. I currently have/had DIRECTV which I am happy with but I just needed internet. Went to the Comcast office. They told me I can get 150 mbps internet for $54.99 a month with free cable at $0.00 and HBO. I was fully aware that it was up to me to cancel with 12 month or they will increase my bill automatically which I brought to the rep's attention and she confirmed. Installation would be $67.00. I knew after reading the disclaimer that was a mere estimated quote. Took time off work. Comcast comes out and explains to me what they need to to do get me internet. They would basically need to wire darn near my entire grid on my power line poles some distance away (3 power line poles crossing several private properties). I knew that wouldn't cost $67. No way, considering I'm a supervisor in the maintenance field. I know this game. I get an email about the appointment they made to execute the configuration in the neighborhood. I didn't have time to ask my neighbor's permission for Comcast to access their properties as that's just too much. Directv sent me a modem and it took me 30 mins. to install on my own. That all I wanted. So I call after hours (they claim they are 24 hour service hotline). After I finally get navigate the option to find downgrade or deactivate the automated system tells me something like ""The automated system is currently closed. Call back Mon-Fri 7 AM-7 PM"". Mind you my personal phone number was logged in to their automated system and they knew my account info based on my phone ID. I called while at work just hours before they were to install and each time I called I was immediately directed to a message stating ""The circuits are down. Please call again later"". I called 15 times repeatedly. And lucky me, I have a work phone. I immediately call and guess what, it connects. They didn't have that number on file. Eventually after repeatedly explaining I don't want their service as they continue to attend a reschedule the install, I tell the guy ""Have a good day."" As he is hanging up he says ""Yeah whatever"". And that was my great escape."
"A. of Chicago, IL",7/9/2015,,"I have service, if you can call it that, for approximately 2 weeks and in that time I have placed no less than 27 phone calls taking up so much time minute wise that has amounted to 21 hours of talk/wait time and STILL the issues continue. How did this all begin you ask? Well in a far away kingdom called Chicago a fair and lovely Jewish American Princess ordered internet only service. The first evil stepsister told the lovely Ann (that would be me) to purchase my own modem rather than rent from the evil empire known as Comcast or Xfinity. As it turned the modem was the wrong one so paid for shipping to and from and a restocking fee. The second time around was a repeat performance and then I followed the advice of the technician and guess what?? Give up? That was also wrong so the fair Ann incurred something in the neighborhood of $100 in all the aforementioned fees. After strenuously defending my position I cut a deal whereby I would get 12 months of the company modem for no fee Which is fine well and good, however in my small 500 square foot flat I can only get service in the room in which the modem resides. Again I received 2 months of credit, bit free or not what good is half assed nonexistent service? I thought AT&T was bad and you can read my review for them on this site. It seems I might I have to find the lesser of the two evils. Oh and by the way I do not have cable, instead I purchased the Amazon Fire Stick. It plugs into my television which is less than five feet from my modem and still service is constantly interrupted. I have been trying to watch a documentary about the Hundred Years War. I feel that I have begun to re-enact that event in real time or should I say reel time."
"Lorraine of Indianapolis, IN",7/9/2015,,Comcast customer service of the worst... they are lack of training information. I was told that I could easily move my service from one city to the next however I tried that and then still needed to run my social security number so each time you set up service they need to run your social security number. The Cable company ever.
"Licia of Petersburg, VA",7/9/2015,,I ordered Comcast services 3 weeks ago and it was suppose to be installed 7/7/2015... No one showed up for schedule appointment. So they Said someone was coming later that day.. No one showed. The same thing happens for 3 days straight and there is no explanation as to why no one came... So tomorrow they are sending (supposedly) another tech... If no one shows from Comcast...I'll stick with dish.
"Martha of Centennial, CO",7/9/2015,,"On June 6, 2015 I upgraded our cable tv service after receiving an offer that would increase our base bill by $20. I should have known, because the last time I did this, it took over a week for the service to actually go into effect. But, that's another complaint. When I received the bill, which I did expect to be a little higher, it was nearly $100 higher. This was a prorated amount and it was still ridiculous. I called and spoke to a ""customer service executive"" (seriously???) in the billing dept. who transferred me to some dept. She looked over the bill and noticed that there were 5 cable boxes being billed - we have 3. She noticed other things wrong with the bill and said she would have to have it reviewed and would call me back the following morning at 9am. I explained that I was skeptical that I would receive a callback and she assured me that she would. I never heard from her. I then called again and spoke to someone in the loyalty dept. in Colo. Springs named Karina. Even though they give you their names, it's impossible to track them down. They were going to charge a $220 cancellation fee for going back down to our previous service because it was past the 30 day refusal date, because I had been trying to get someone to help me and no one would. We have been Comcast customers for 11 years and I told her that she needs to delete the cancellation fee. She said that was impossible because it was already in the ""system"". I told her that was not acceptable and I requested to speak to a supervisor. There were none available, but I could request a callback. Well, I've been down that road before and refused and I wanted this resolved at that time. I was put on hold and lo and behold a ""manager"" appeared and told her they could credit my account in the amount of the $220 cancellation fee. I asked that the current bill I have be corrected to reflect the number of cable boxes, etc. She ""assured"" me that it would be taken care of. I requested an email spelling out all of this and she again ""assured"" me she would do that. Dumb me. I've not received an email and my bill online still shows the incorrect amount due. I called this am - AGAIN and was told that it has been revised and service has been changed to our previous level and the cancellation fee has not been charged. I asked to receive an email showing this, but was told I would receive a revised bill in the mail showing the correct amount and our new monthly amount. I'm not holding my breath. This company has the WORST service and they just don't care. No one that I have dealt with seems to care about doing their job (a problem in most customer service positions these days). I will do everything to figure out an alternative to Comcast."
"Michael of Brandon, MS",7/10/2015,,"Months. To anyone reading this, try to find a different provider if possible. They don't back up what they say."
"alberto of Houston, TX",7/10/2015,,"Went to end my service, and the guy acted like he didn't want to do it and was very rude about it. My bill has been going up and up for no reason. I said just cancel, just like that, I didn't want to have a conversation, especially with such a rude person. Then the douche hung up on me like nothing. Customer Service at Comcast has to be the worst."
"eldred of Nashville, TN",7/10/2015,,"I got connected July 3rd. My service went out that night. I called July 4th. Customer Service was pleasant and promised to send out a technician on Monday July 6th. No technician showed. Finally, after two more calls on Tuesday and Wednesday it came on magically on Thursday morning. It went off again Thursday night. I called again today and was told a technician would be out Tuesday July 14th. I'm holding my breath!"
"Jason of Compton, CA",7/10/2015,,"I manage IT for a non-profit. We have multiple business and residential accounts. Working with the business side isn't as bad, as you have a rep you communicate with directly. On the residential side, though, it's sometimes a complete disaster just doing basic things, like getting service installed at a house. They either don't call back to schedule installation, or they schedule it on their own and show up when nobody is there (just happened yesterday). Sometimes they'll call me before they get to an appointment so I have time to meet them, sometimes they don't, then they wonder why nobody answers the door.Furthermore, trying to move existing service from one address to another is nearly impossible. I'd rather bang my head against a wall repeatedly than deal with this company. WORST company I've EVER dealt with, and dealing with Comcast is by FAR the worst part of my job. I deal with so many different vendors and service providers. Comcast makes companies like AT&T look like saints.COMCAST: When you have to have a ticket system at your customer service locations in order to serve customers (like the BMV) because you have so many people coming in, maybe that tells you something. The last time I was in there (about a week ago), one woman was literally in tears because of some issue getting a credit on her account. The rep was stone faced and cold. Another guy comes to drop off equipment and bypasses the ticket system and drops the equipment on the counter. He and the rep argue for a couple seconds and he storms out with the rep yelling that he will charge him for the equipment. Obviously the customer was in the wrong, but the rep did not help the situation in any way. You just feel like you're stepping into a hostile environment coming in there."
"Evelyn of Scranton, PA",7/10/2015,,My service got suspended yesterday so @ 3 pm I called the 800 # & was told I needed to pay $147.48. So @ 9 pm when I got home from work I tried to go online to make my payment. But I forgot my password so I went on a live chat to try to reset it but was not helped. Very long story I called all day today & I was sent from 1 department to another but still no one can help me. So I finally say @ 8:20 pm that I want to talk to a supervisor. I was told they would call back within 1 hour. No call back so I call again @ 9:30 & again sent to different departments with no help. Then of course the department I need to turn services on is closed. So it is 25 hours after I wanted to pay & have service turned on. I still have not even paid because no one knows what they are doing.
"Bryan of Plantation, FL",7/11/2015,,"XFINITY customer service center, thank you for surpassing my expectations today. I had arranged for new 75 mbps Blast! service to be installed today to replace my 18 mbps U-verse Internet (btw 12 mbps taken up by U-verse TV) between 10am and 12 noon, and appreciated the email and calls confirming the time. I was able to rearrange my phone calls and appointments, and put the dog in the crate. Thank you Comcast for respecting my time, the only resource I cannot get back.At 11:53, no one had called or shown up, so as a proactive customer service center you had me call into your 800 number, which asked if I was calling about my installation, and then proceeded to inform me that you were unsure when a technician would arrive, and transferred me to Shandra in customer service. Shandra told me my tech was on the way. In fact, Shandra was so good, that Shy (escapee from Inside Out - and yes that is her name) from the Sacramento OC Dispatcher team called at 12:05 to inform me my tech was running late and would be there in about 20 minutes. At 12:20, because of the proactiveness of Comcast, I called customer service again, figuring that the tech had to take lunch. I mean, no appointments are scheduled between 12-1 according to Comcast and they are subject to hourly wage laws. I spoke to two people including a manager who offered me $20 gift card or 3 months of a premium service for my time. Um, did you see I only have Comcast Internet, not Comcast TV? Oh yes, I was told that unlike Domino's Pizza (yep, Comcast brought up Domino's!!), who can track my pizza to my house, Comcast does not know where their tech's are until they press a button on a phone or laptop. Hello, 2015 calling - if a tech does not enter an update 15 minutes before the next call, perhaps they are going to be late, and you may want to proactively notify the next customer? Comcast mentioned that they were going to be having such a service for customers in the future, so you will now be able to look up where the techs are not supposed to be. I think it will be an Apple Maps program they use to locate their techs.Or just look up Domino's to find your Comcast tech.At 1pm, I called Shy in dispatch because Comcast expects me to follow up with them first when someone does not show up. Shy paused and asked if I had cancelled my service, because the person she had scheduled to show up by 12:20 had a cancelled ticket from me. She apologized and said it was a Comcast issue (be still my heart) and she would arrange a new call between 1pm and 3pm today. At 1:38 Comcast called me (woo hoo! I am special!) and told me the tech would be at my home between 1 and 3pm (it was 1:38pm) and more than likely would be here by 2pm. Are you sensing a pattern? 2:03, let's call Comcast up to see how their automated system is working. Hello ""we are unsure of the arrival time of your tech, please hold for an agent."" John comes on the phone, and he is good, and empathetic, and talks about under committing and over performing. He wants to take ownership of the issues - now someone is talking my language - and will call me back to follow up to see how the installation goes.3pm, who let the dogs out? Me, they were tired of being cramped up. 3:07pm, called Sacramento dispatch to talk to my Pixar friend Shy, no answer went into some IVR hell with options such as ""choose 4 for Not Home Service"". Hung up, called 800 number. My computer friend again said unsure when tech would arrive, passed me to an agent. She is trying to connect me to a supervisor. They are all busy exceeding customer expectations on other calls, and I ask her if she can have an agent call me back. I was in tears, begging, pleading, on my knees - please stop the Xfinity, I mean insanity! She said ""no"", there is no option to have a manager call me back, but they review all these types of cases so they can resolve them and prevent from happening again. I asked her, ""do you resolve these issues without talking or following up with the customer directly?"" And she saidâ€¦ wait for itâ€¦ ""yes"". I asked her ""how can you provide customer service without involving the customer? How do you not have an option to have a manager or supervisor call a customer back?""As I was on the phone with the customer service person the tech showed up. His name is NoName or we can call him Tech 7546. He never introduced himself. As he walked in carrying dirt on his shoes (btw AT&T tech all put on booties over shoes when they come into homes) and smelling of an overflowing ashtray (he does not drive for Uber in his spare time) he said he was from Comcast (thank you!), and then he was on time for his 3pm-5pm appointment. Valerie came home and could not park, because NoName parked in her spot in driveway instead of on street.He was on time! Thank you #Xfinity! I love Comcast for showing up on time 3 hours late. But they continued to exceed my expectations, my pretties! ""Hmm, there is no cable here, you need to have one installed"". ""Yes"", I responded, ""just like the work order I put in requested. Let me show you the attic access I have had cleared out for you all week"". NoName went outside, checked the box, came back with his ladder and more dirt because Comcast wants us to exercise after they leave, thank you for thinking about me. He looks in attic and says, ""I cannot fit in there. We need a smaller tech and it is hot in the attic. I cannot do this job"". NoName is skinnier than me, I can get in the attic, and we had 3 people in there last week cabling electrical and network cables without an issue. NoName leaves, head down, shoulders sunken back to his truck. 10 minutes later, I get a call from Comcast. They are calling me! Publishers Clearing House must be outside! What did I win? ""Hello"", she said, ""we need to reschedule for Saturday. The installation should be done early in morning because it is hot in the attic, in Florida, in the summer, during the day when we do our jobs."" I asked her, ""like between 10 am-12 noon?"" She said ""yes"", but had an 8-9am opening. Oh Joy! Comcast will allow me to wake up earlier to set expectation of not showing up that much better!But I missed John's call. Yes, John who wanted to help and take ownership called me back at 3:26, and apologized for not calling at 3pm. ""I see the tech arrived at 2:45, hope all went well and I will call you back shortly"". 2:45?? Well he is closest to the pin, and he did call back so I give him kudos for doing what he said. So now we wait, I called Executive Customer Relations in Philadelphia, where the difference between normal customer service reps and Executive ones is the Executive team has access to better drugs. They are on morphine and do not have any emotions after dealing with issues like this all day long. She tells me a manager will call me back within 24 hours. I asked her ""24 hours Comcast time?"" There was no response.So now it is Minions time, the Amc 8 Movies Sunrise serves alcohol so it should make the movie even better. At least I will feel better, whilst I dream of little Comcast trucks driving around a neighborhood but never stopping anywhere. And I have XFINITY to thank for showing me how sales and customer service are supposed to work, and exceeding customer expectations. The $20 gift card or 3 months of premium cable service (did I mention I am only an Internet subscriber, not TV?) will go far to recapture the glorious moments of the past 8 hours, as there was the epitome of what a Friday should be."
"rachelle of Wyoming, MI",7/11/2015,,"After having the installation it became clear the salesman had NO working knowledge of technology side of the business. The salesman also gave a quote that was far off. For example, the installation was supposed to be $19.95 (Special promotion, he said), but ended up being $35. Then I was told I could use my own modem (I specifically asked if it would be compatible). He resoundingly said â€œit would work just fineâ€ -- WRONG! That's another $10, plus tax, a month for the Xfinity/Comcast modem (Or you can purchase one from Best Buy for $200). In addition, there is almost $25 of extra fees/taxes, not including the sales tax! Just ridiculous!I was reassured emphatically that the amount at the bottom of the page was the final charge plus the normal sales tax - the great promotion they had going, he said. THEN to top it all off, when I called and spoke to a sales representative (assuming it was all just a billing mistake), not only did they do NOTHING to fix the bill (in fact the charges were defended), but the woman PURPOSELY gave me the wrong date of 30 new install termination so I would have to pay the $230 early termination fee. Also, shockingly, an hour later my conversation with the sales representative all of our on-demand disappeared -- the system said we were not subscribed -- of which was supposed to be part of the promotion I signed up for... Coincidental? My gut knows better. Comcast is the worst company I have ever dealt with, completely unethical and shady. I am going back to Dish."
"John of Screw, CA",7/11/2015,,"They lured me with a package deal, a fancy new box with high quality video and I wish I could go back to dish. Almost every day my box freezes and reboots in the middle of a show. Finally got frustrated enough to call and spent 42 minutes on hold. Determined to have my peace until I finally gave up. So disappointed."
"Douglas of Tucson, AZ",7/12/2015,,"Just moved to a new home in Tucson. After being with Cox Cable for years, this location required I have Comcast. I'd read reviews and was concerned. After calling three different times talking with customer service reps and getting three different requirements and prices for bundles etc. Talked with the supervisor and got no relief. I was so frustrated I called home office in Philadelphia and talked with Mike. He listened and repeated back what my concerns were and turned me over to Amanda who also listened carefully and understood my frustration. She had Ben from Portland, Oregon who is charge of Arizona, contact me and he gave me what I needed. Amanda expedited my hook-up and I'm a happy camper. Why did I have to go through all that? More training is needed in Tucson for sure. These three, Mike, Amanda, and Ben more than atoned for my frustrating experience. I'm thrilled thus far with all the services. It's not how you start, but how you finish. Thanks Comcast!"
"Renata of Arlington, VA",7/12/2015,,"This company is the worst. I started with Comcast in May 2014. It started out ok. But then the internet would go off and then I would have to call them to see what was going on. Every time I called I would get a phone call after a week or so and the message would say ""you requested service. If you don't call us back we'll assume you still need the service."" What in the world? I would desperately call back knowing that a service request meant extra charge. I would call and ask ""What is going on? When did I request this service?"" Another time I was moving to a new apartment. I called to request a transfer of the same service with no changes to my new apartment. A lady told me ""yes, yes it will stay intact and the same service will be transferred"".. What a liar! The first month I get a charge that was supposed to be $85 including taxes was $172. I called after opening my bill and the rep tells me. ""oh, yes ma'am, you requested A New Service and therefore you have a new account number""! Upset I hung up the phone, called back. The new rep told me that I didn't request the new service, which that was accurate, ""but the reason you are charged that amount"" he said ""was because when you move, the account changes""? I told him that before moving to the new apartment I called to make sure that the service would stay the same. He said, ""oh no, it never stays the same when a customer moves to another area."" At that point I was so angry. I didn't want anything to do with this company. I spoke to the manager of the condo I'm renting and she said that Comcast is the only internet and cable service available in the units. :( I was so disappointed, I spoke to the Comcast supervisor requesting a service removal for good. He gave me a better price and ""removed"" the mistake, but then again after a month I get another bill for the amount $172. I called back again, the rep would tell me ""it's solved now"". After a month same thing for the amount $162 now. The supervisor again gave me a promotion to have me stay with them and not to remove the service. He said that there was no record of my payments!! Unbelievable! I honestly hope this company goes bankrupt like GM did. I will be so happy when this happens. Today I called again because I got a phone called about 45 minutes ago from a Comcast rep telling me another lie. She said on the message ""hello miss, we have scheduled a technician go see the problem, and if you Don't call us back, we'll assume you still need a technician"". I never requested anyone to come to my home. So I immediately on a Saturday at 8pm when I got this untasteful message, called back and the lady rep tells me, ""Yes, you have a technician scheduled for Monday at 1pm"". First of all that was a lie, and second I would never request anyone on a Monday and much less at 1pm.I honestly need someone to look over the company. Someone has to put a stop to this. This should not be happening in America. Corruption is present in this Comcast company and should be banned. Time Warner Cable has been the best so far, but it's the North. I guess in the South there's always more corruption. Thank you for reading my complaint. I actually give the company -1000 STARS."
"Anthony of Houston, TX",7/12/2015,,"Recently, I begun having connectivity issues with my XFINITY Home Security. It seems that the base unit lost wi-fi connection and as a result was not functioning. I was notified via a computer-generated email. Later that day and upon arriving home, I discovered that there were problems with my ENTIRE ""X1"" system. I had pixelation problems with a number of channels, my smart TV was suddenly not so smart (loss connectivity), no wi-fi. And the telephone? Well suffice it to say I'm happy that I had cellular service. Contacted Customer Service and ran through the entire reboot, restart, etc. at the request of (1) the representative and then (2) a technician from the X1 department. All of this was done but to no avail.I sent a letter to the executive offices and this is the response that I received: ""Hello Mr. **, Thank you for contacting Comcast Executive Office with your concern. I look forward to speaking with you about this. Please let me know when I could reach you via telephone to discuss resolution for this concern. Please feel free to contact me at 1-888-966-7794 ext. **."" Well they certainly sent someone out (actually 2 people) who did absolutely nothing but switch equipment and inform me that the problem was ""back at the office"" and they would have to reset the system. Well, that was a couple of weeks ago and I am no closer to resolving many of my issues than when they began. I have not heard back from the Executive Offices though I have sent 2 emails and placed a number of calls to the rep that sent the initial email response to my complaint.Here is the last email that I sent: ""Annette: I intentionally waited this long to see if a return call from you or this office would be forthcoming. Obviously one was not. I am truly disappointed by the silence from this office and it only serves as an indication as to the type of customer service is passed along to subordinate CS personnel within this organization. This issues with WI-FI connectivity remain unchanged. Your service personnel swapped the router and was able to get my home security system back online; however, I still do not have connection from either my smartphone or television. This means that I am unable to stream music or movies through my regular providers (i.e. Netflix, Pandora, ROKA television, etc.) and this is frustrating to me.I spent approximately 2.5 hours with my cellular provider (T-Mobile) who assures me that the problems being experienced with WI-FI connectivity on my phone is a problem within your system. The error codes provided on the television appear to be known to your service technicians. In order for me to move forward, this must be fixed. I am unwilling to continue to pay for services that I am not receiving and this include WI-FI. The ""snow"" or poor signal on select channel remain a problem; however, it has been reduced to USA and A&E. This is reflected in the recordings of programs on those channels. Since I am recording them to my DVR, it would seem obvious that Comcast has the ability to look closer at this problem.I paid my previous bill in good faith believing that this office would correct the problems. You have not. I will not pay another bill until the problem has been corrected or Comcast terminates my 2 year contract/agreement; releasing me from any further obligations. I have decided to retain an attorney to review my present contract in correlations to the service that I am being provided. I am doing so to better understand my options in this matter. Please do not view my actions as a threat of any sort. As I previously explained to you (as well as others) I am big on ""customer service"" and this is what is lacking in our communications. Please be advised that I will not continue to remain silent on these issues. If necessary, I will forward my complaint to the President of Comcast; as well as posting on the various blog sites relating to service issues and Comcast.I will give you until the close of business on Friday, July 10th 2015 to contact me and resolve these issues. If I do not hear from you (or another member from this office) by that time, I will conclude that Comcast has effectively decided to ignore the terms of their service commitment to me and my account and I will take the appropriate action. The decision, whatever it may be, is clearly yours."" I finish by saying that I think that it's time people consider coming together and seeking counsel from an attorney willing to take on NBC, Comcast and its affiliates. We are paying too much for services that are often less than what they promised or is implied. Just my 2 cents."
"Peter of Pleasanton, CA",7/12/2015,,"In just over a year, Comcast nearly doubled my rates for internet, phone, and basic cable. Comcast is unregulated, and can do as it pleases, the customer be damned. Now I've cut the cord. A low cost internet provider gives me better connection speeds, and Hulu, Amazon, Netflix, and YouTube give me better, mostly ad-free content at a fraction of the price. Wake up, America. If you live in a metro area and are still paying for cable, you're paying way too much. The only thing cable giants like Comcast understand is the bottom line."
"brittany of North Versailles, PA",7/12/2015,,"I had just cable $79.99 a month since March 2015 with all channels, they never told me when promotion ended so I was unaware. Got bill in May 2015 stating bill was $199 because promotion ended and wasn't notified. Representative suggested I get all 3 services, cable, phone and internet. Told him I didn't have a need, then he told me it will come out cheaper and have a bill of $107 a month with other fees. Also told me my installation fee was $40 -$49 then I get everything. And after the fact they tell me my installation fee was 107 + all these other bogus fees I was unaware of and my bill is $400. They rip you off, don't tell you anything upfront then give you all these different high bills. That's totally uncalled for. I will also be contacting the BBB as well. Every last technician and representative told me different things."
"Bob of Ct, CT",7/12/2015,,"Called Comcast as again my On Demand is not working. This has been going on for 2 years now off and on. After 40 mins on the phone trying to fix the problem remotely, I am told the soonest appointment I can get to potentially fix this problem is 7/22/15, 12 days from my complaint day. I tell them that this is not acceptable and I am told I can call back in 2 days and see if they can better the appointment date. My On Demand goes out every 2 to 4 months. Due to my work hours and bed time, the shows I enjoy are after I go to bed and On Demand is the only way to watch them. I have been told at least 10 times the problem has been fixed, it hasn't. I have been told and promised at least 10 times I would receive a follow up phone call from a Call center rep and/or a technical support representative and not once was there a call back. Comcast is the WORST company I have ever had to deal with. They take your money, which I pay on time EVERY month, and move on. No consideration at all for their customers."
"Karen of Lauderhill, Nc, FL",7/12/2015,,"Comcast came out to work on cable lines and disrupted our service. When we called, they told us no one could help us for 4 days even though their workers caused us to not have service. They promised someone would call us next day and no one did."
"Faisal of Walnut Creek, CA",7/13/2015,,"This is the worst cable company I've had the displeasure of dealing with and working for at one point. They mislead you with their promos and when you call to complain, you just get the runaround. I hope your stocks plummet!! Billing is always off and support sucks."
"Max of Minneapolis, MN",7/13/2015,,"I have had Comcast for 3 years and over time my internet cost has gone up tremendously. They continued to try to upsale us on cable and finally offered a deal where either our internet and phone would cost more than what we would pay for internet, phone, and cable so I took them up on this. Eventually the cable price went up more and we started at paying 45 dollars a month approximately and ended up around 120. I started getting suspicious as every time I called them they offered me different prices on different things. Finally I decided it was time to remove all services other than internet because the bill was just too high. Every time I said I wanted to remove a service they told me they could discount it and this is after many people had told me the rates they were offering were their lowest rates and I wouldn't find anything lower anywhere else. I realized that the bundled packages aren't actually accurate offers. They tell you how much the internet cost at a higher rate than what they actually will charge you. Then they tell you the phone is only 3 dollars more a month. But if you cancel packaged services it opens up other pricings they won't reveal to you until after your service is cancelled. And even then you have to wait days until that cancellation has taken effect before they reveal the newly available discounted price for single service package.The worst part of all of this is that I was sold a 50 Mbps internet package without being told that in MN the maximum they can offer with that package is 25. They continually told me 50 is not available but then I find out that there is a 50 Mbps package (it is actually 105 but in MN the maximum they give for that package is 50). I didn't even want to start the conversation of requesting a refund for the difference in pricing between what they sold me and what they provided. I did eventually argue with a customer loyalty rep for a while about what pricing options they had available until she agreed to actually look and found the pricing option that I was referring to which she had insisted wasn't available.Their business model is so similar to illegal drugs. Get them hooked on convenience and affordability and then raise the prices and introduce new services at discounted rates only to increase those rates dramatically as well. If you call to cancel your services one at a time you can get the best prices out of them. I am now getting double the internet speed for half the price I was paying. Again straight up misinforming customers about what they are purchasing is my biggest complaint and secondary is their purposeful taking advantage of people who just don't happen to call in to ask if their services are available at lower prices."
"Barbara of Jacksonville, FL",7/13/2015,,"Touchton office in Jacksonville, FL. The normal interaction with Comcast via telephone is so predictably deplorable, time consuming, ill informed, hard to understand, etc etc. (I'll leave those posts to others.) This concerns the visit to the office today to return unneeded equipment since the person who wanted cable TV no longer lives here. There was no waiting time though I was told it is busier some days. April accepted the equipment. When I showed her the screen shot of an internet only special that the phone rep could not find or offer me, she tracked it down and not only found it but found one better and explained it to me. The experience of a few months back of returning their rented modem was equally painless and pleasant. If I could give more stars to this local Comcast office, and April in particular, I would."
"comcast of Bolingbrook, IL",7/13/2015,,"This is one of the worst companies in the world. They are rude and they really try to scam you when they can. I already canceled my cable and now buy internet through AT&T and watch streaming TV. Do not need cable no more. For some reason, I checked my receipt and see them charge me almost $900.00 for one month. I talked to them on the phone. They admit the mistake but they said they cannot refund me the difference. The only thing they can do is just use that towards credit for the next 8 months. I said I cannot afford or want to charge 900.00 on my credit card. They said they really cannot do anything. So I contact my credit card and they did their magic. I also canceled my service. I hate Comcast."
"elina of Lafayette, CO",7/13/2015,,"Comcast xfinity customer September 2014. Since then start having problems with them. Every month I'm calling, try to figure out why they charge me extra money. It's not $20-40, it's $200-300 for something I don't understand. They try make up stories why they charge me. The stories always different. Usually they're saying I'm late on payment. Then I review my bills, bank statement, it's not a problem.. Call them again and then the fun begins. Each operator telling different reason why. One - that I rent the movie, 2 - I switch the plan, 3 - extra charge for 911 calls (that's my favorite), 4 - extra money for connecting the phone and internet.. Then after an hour of struggle they connect you with manager and with him in a more polite way you fight for the truth. It's just awful. I'm so tired of this. It takes a lot of time and my nerves."
"John of Tyrone, PA",7/13/2015,,"At least a 20 minute hold time no matter time of day, with the same music and a constant reminder every 30 seconds that ""your call is important to us."" Spent an hour and a half on the phone to try and sort out why they sent a repo agent to my house (never heard of that before). Transferred 4 times before speaking with someone directly employed by Comcast (they love outsourcing their work to third parties); said one bad thing on twitter and someone from the handle @comcastcares asked me to DM them. When I did, it took 20 minutes in between messages for them to respond and another hour and a half for them to mark my account and take off some erroneous charges. The worst customer service I have ever encountered and not deserving of anyone's money."
"Rose of Millsboro, Other",7/13/2015,,"I was previously living in a house and moved elsewhere and rented it to someone else. I called Comcast and explained the situation. I asked them if I should return the equipment. They stated ""No you can transfer the account over to the new renters."" They stated they would send a form. The form never arrived so the new renters called Comcast in my presence and they stated that they didn't do that. Then they stated that they would have to start a new account and have someone come to the house to install. The next available day was a week away. I agreed to pay for that week. The Comcast installer came and brought the new equipment on June 13. I received a bill through the 21. The new renters got a bill from the 13th so I am paying for a week that they also are paying for. When I called up they told me that when I cancelled I had to pay for three weeks regardless of whether the other renter was paying also. Does this make any sense? The Comcast installer took away the equipment I was using on the 13th so how can they charge me for 8 days when I didn't live there and my equipment had been returned and then charge the new renter for the same 8 days?"
"Terrence of Pompano Beach, FL",7/14/2015,,"I made a payment extension with Comcast/Xfinity to extend my payment for another week. They told me that they would have to print a ticket for it but my service would not be affected for a whole week. The very next day they shut my service off. I tried to call them to resolve the matter and I was on 30 minute+ wait times. Then it kept disconnecting me every time I entered my information. When I finally got to a live person, she asked for my info then placed me on hold and disconnected me. I called after that and I continued to call afterwards and was disconnected every time. I contacted Comcast by chat and they told me they don't see a ticket that was ever printed and they can't help me. I wonder why in the hell do I even waste my time speaking to customer service and make a payment arrangement if they are incompetent at honoring their agreement on their end. I advise anyone to go to DIRECTV or DISH Network if they can so they won't have to deal with this type of disrespect from a cable company who feels they can treat you any kind of way."
"Sal of Charleston, SC",7/14/2015,,"I called to have a new installation for Xfinity internet. I was scheduled for 6 days later between 3 & 5 pm, what they called ""the guaranteed two-hour window."" On that day no one called and no one showed to do the install. After spending 1 1/2 hours on the phone with them I was finally told no one was available to come that evening and they rescheduled the install ONE WEEK later. After repeated attempts to talk to a supervisor I was finally able to get them to agree to come two days later, but was given a 12-hour window. I had to take off from work. The install was completed at about 7pm and the installer left, but by 7:15 the service no longer worked. I spent another hour and half on the phone trying to get some resolution but I was told I would have to wait another 4 days. The next morning I called and spoke to a supervisor then finally asked to terminate the service. I was transferred to the ""Customer Retention"" department (this took about 45 minutes) who then assured me she could find a solution. She transferred me to a ""specialist"" in Florida who assured and promised me he would resolve the issue. He promised that a technician would call me in an hour. When two hours passed and I had not received a response I called and cancelled the service.In the past I have dealt with Optonline, Verizon and AT&T. Never before had I been so deceived, received such poor service and witnessed such ineptness. Comcast is, without exaggeration, the worst company I have ever dealt with. In the end I lost out on two full days of work, spent a total of nearly 4 hours on the phone, been lied to a total of four times, sat through two missed appointments, and navigated through their phone system dozens of times (which is a barbaric experience).Please note that the individuals who answer the phone are polite and attentive. This is not a criticism of them as individuals, but the company they work for is horrible. They do not care about their customers. They do not have systems in place for situations where things fall apart, and they are cold, impersonal and unresponsive. Do not let their advertising slogans and ads fool you. You will not like working with Comcast. If there are any other services available in your area, choose of them before Comcast! Do not make the mistake of becoming one of their customers."
"nell of West Palm Beach, FL",7/14/2015,,Worst service I've ever had. Our HOA gives us free TV from Comcast so they give us the cheapest internet equipment even when we return it for better equipment. And forget them sending anyone out. But if they do they won't /can't fix problem. Moving to DSL. Might be slower but I might be able to stream a 30 minute show in under 3 hours including interrupted service.
"Pauline of Oley, PA",7/14/2015,,"There appears to be on going issues with the digital box. There is constant freezing whenever you're exploring the offered films and shows available on the networks offered. Whenever the playlist are chosen for viewing later, it is erased or suddenly unavailable for viewing. Numerous times are spent restarting the box to hopefully reset the digital box, but to no avail, the problems persist. Customer service is ineffective, no one seems to be able to assist. A very displeased customer considering the cost of the digital box."
"Rachel of Aurora, IL",7/14/2015,,"I received a call from Comcast last week stating that my 12 month subscription was about to expire, and offering me a new promotional 12 month subscription. I asked if I could have some time to think over the offer, and was told that I needed to make a decision immediately. The offer was decent, and not too much more expensive, so thinking I didn't have many other options, I agreed. I was thinking about the whole thing a couple of days later and realized that it didn't seem like it had been 12 months since I had gotten Comcast. I looked into it and it had only been 8 months.I called Comcast and after being transferred to 3 different people got to someone who could ""help"". I asked if I could finish out the remainder of my previous subscription and was told that since I had agreed to the new one, I couldn't go back. I explained again that the sales rep had misspoken when she said my subscription was expiring (which was the only reason I agreed to switch), and that I'd like to finish out my previous subscription. I was told that I should be happy with the new subscription that I was getting, as it offered me more cable options (note: I was an internet only customer, so the cable was not important to me, it just happened to be part of the bundle). I was basically told ""too little, too late"" (not in those exact words, but the tone was less than polite). I then asked to cancel my service, which was surprisingly met with a response of ""Okay, as of when do you want to cancel?"" I told her I wanted to cancel immediately, and she said that wouldn't be a problem.I feel as though Comcast was less than honest in their dealings with me, and also less than courteous/polite. I was shocked at how willing they were to lose a customer, especially with how they've been promising to improve their customer relations. I have had nothing but bad experiences with Comcast and will not be a customer of theirs again in the near future."
"Krystle of Stafford, TX",7/15/2015,,"HORRIBLE! I've called Xfinity/Comcast everyday since I have their service (about 2 weeks). The internet never works, the equipment is faulty, causing me to take trips to the Xfinity store several times to exchange equipment. When I called to cancel I was promised that a service person would show up TODAY 7/15/15 between 8 am and 10 am to remedy the issue. I took the morning off work for this to be done. At 10 am I called Xfinity/Comcast since had not relieved a phone call or seen anyone show up. The customer service rep told me that I have to reschedule because the service guy did not show up! Unbelievable and UNPROFESSIONAL! I AM DISCONNECTING!"
"Genuine of New Bedford, MA",7/15/2015,,"I pay $50 a month for the ""economy"" internet service which is supposed to give me 1.5-3 Mbps but my family can't even watch a streaming video on Roku at night because the service is so slow. All it does is keep loading. Small businesses run entire offices off of 1.5-3 Mbps of Internet service, why can't a small family of 3 run the usual technology devices? I call Comcast every few weeks to get assistance with my issue. I spend an hour on the phone and nothing gets resolved. They reset my modem and try to seek me faster internet service which is 50% more than I'm paying now. I have zero options for other internet providers in my area and feel Comcast should be allowed to monopolize the business and continue to provide horrible service."
"Yvonne of Springdale, MD",7/15/2015,,"Received my first bill $597 for install, fees and taxes. Spoke to the CEO who passed my file to the Exec. CSl. This ind. reduced svs/cost. Have paid $230. The bill is still $545. Service was interrupted until I pay $111. Still dunning me $545."
"C. N. of Oakbrook, IL",7/15/2015,,"Since the inception of my services my billing and/or package charge was incorrect. I spent the next two years chasing the billing department at Comcast in order to get the credits and billing correct. Every time they would correct the package that they did not bill correctly for they would also charge a service fee to the bill for their error. Then you would have to call to have the service fee removed which could then generate another service fee. Then they would offer additional free services (additional movie channel for three months) to ""apologize"" for their errors. However when the ""promotion"" would revert back, they would then screw up the package price and AGAIN charge the incorrect amount and another service fee. As my package was ending I negotiated for a different package to start when that package ended which was the 30th of the month. When the next bill was issued (prior to the actual ending of the current package) and it was incorrect too, I knew this was just going to be more of the same so I cancelled service on the actual date my contract ended and returned the equipment that next day. They should have refunded a small amount of money as my first contract ran through 30th of the month prior to any changes and the new contract did not begin until the 1st of the month. I had to call to speak with them three times regarding the refund and was assured three times that the refund was being sent within 6-8 weeks. After 8 weeks I am now being told that I am not being issued a refund as they changed the package on the 27th of the month and therefore I was not due a refund. It doesn't matter what the dollar amount is with Comcast, they are horrendous at billing and making good on their promises."
"jeanne of Jacksonville, FL",7/15/2015,,"I recently ask to have my landline removed from my service and was told that I could not. Because I have a 2 year contract and it would cost me 200.00 to remove it. This is the thing - I was con into a 2 year contract by a fast talking rep who I could not understand because she spoke broken English. I did not sign anything to that effect. I do not need my landline anymore because when I got it, my mom was in hospice home care and it was required. My mom has since passed away and it is no longer needed. I feel as if I was con into a 2 year contract. I am not trying to cancel my other services just the landline.. Comcast use these tactics because they know there is no other option but them. Sad, real sad."
"Brittney of Dothan , AL",7/15/2015,,"I received my Comcast equipment on 7/13/15. Hook up the equipment, try to activate it. I get messages saying it is a outage in my area. My neighbor has his cable running... They tell me it will be running at certain time.. I'll probably be TWC WOW."
"Brian of Crystal Lake, IL",7/16/2015,,"My wife and I WERE going to change our internet/cable service. I took the day off of work to be home for the appointment. My wife gave the rep scheduling the appointment my contact info and also put me on the ""account"" so I could interact with Comcast. The rep did NOT take any of my info and log it in. Day of installation appointment, they called my wife to say no one was home at 1:14 P.M. The garage door and the front door were WIDE open and clearly visible from the street (50 feet from edge of street). By 1:16 P.M., my wife had given them my number, and they found the time in 2 minutes to call and leave a message saying that I would have to reschedule. I filed a complaint with the BBB. They attempted to contact me after I had previously (7 days earlier) told them to remove my number and email from their database. They still wanted me to establish service with them which would require me to take more time off work (unacceptable) and offered a $25 credit. What an insult. Never doing business with them. EVER."
"Marc of Atlanta, GA",7/16/2015,,"Well, they really have zero workers who have brains. The repair time for their mistakes is always a week out or more. They sent over a Comcast worker who was giving my neighbor cable. So they just disconnect my service and gave him my service because they did not want to do the work! Then drove into our manicured lawn and got stuck. To the point I had to call a tow truck! DO NOT GET COMCAST!"
"Mary of Shelbyville, IN",7/16/2015,,"Call to have service moved to a new home for my mom & dad. They showed up, told us they had to rewire but not that it would cost $90. Then told we got new boxes, not the ones we had. Got the bill and the new boxes were $10 each box, each month. Feel they were taking advantage of older people!!!!! Have had more problems then can count. Cable not working then phone not working. It's always something and they want to charge for everything!! Do NOT like or trust Comcast!!!!"
"G of Summit, NJ",7/16/2015,,"I switch from Verizon to Comcast trying to save some money and it was a huge mistake. First they offered me a deal of $120.00 for Internet and cable. The first month came up for around $250.00 which they explained it was because the first bill was usually more. The second bill was around the same amount. Then on top of that the Internet never worked and they offered me to pay $12.00 more monthly for a boost to have my service working. My next billed was for $460.00. I called and their answer was that I was a month behind because they charge a month as a deposit. I asked when was my bill going to be what they promised and their answer was that there was no way they would tell me exactly how much my bill would be. Then on top of that he added that ""cable was not a necessity."" That if I wanted to have cable I had to pay my bill. The guy was very disrespectful and basically told they didn't care if I had service with them or not.I paid my bill and for my surprise my next bill was 189.00. I called to disconnect the service and the lady offered me a lower rate if I chose the bundle with the three services. What she didn't explain was that for the $92 she offered me was only for local channels and the regular internet which is very slow. The next day I got an email saying my first bill would be 260.00 because they were charging me installation and a whole bunch of other things. I called and the answer was that I was no longer a new customer so the price she gave was change. This is the biggest scam I've ever heard.I finally made the decision to close my account and guess what the next day they contacted me. I Thought they were calling me to apologize or ask me why I have decided to to cancel my service but the guy was only calling to let me know they calculated the final bill and he wanted to collect payment over the phone. I've never seen a company like this. I don't understand how they get to do business legally by scaling and stealing money. I hope someone can finally do something about to stop them. Please think twice before making this big mistake because you will regret it!"
"William of Broomfield, CO",7/16/2015,,"Ok, My parents and I all chip in for the net pay. We pay around 19.99/mo for 20MBPS. Now let me use a picture from speedtest.net as perfect evidence that they are a scam. I am connecting from a town that's still in the 1980's (both literally and metaphorically) and before July 1st when their lines got cut I had net that never lagged. BUT ever since that cut, I've been having net problems day in and out. We replaced our router, and the modem. And we are still getting 3 mbps or lower. DO NOT buy their services. They will scam you of anything you get from them. Oh. And they will wanna send a tech out to take a ""look"" at it. That tech, cost 150 just to send out here. Thank you. ps- SLOWER THAN 78% of the US."
"Dawn of Waterford, MI",7/16/2015,,"I signed up via the internet on 11/7/2014 for the Double Play. I have my sales contract. It was to include internet (105 mbps) and Cable with HBO and Starz for 1 yr at 99.99 per month. With devices and taxes it came to 132.98. When a technician finally arrived to install, he had no ID, immediately called his supervisor and spent an hour on the phone before telling me he was unable to install because the wrong work order had been printed. I called sales with the tech there and he still refused to install. I spent literally 19 hrs on the phone with various Comcast personnel over the next week to get services. I was made promises to right the actions of the technician and the delay in connecting my services. Finally, on 11/17/2014, another tech arrived to install. Again, a phone call placed about my install. All install fees had been waived during the numerous phone calls. The technician realized there was no Comcast line to my house. As an IT professional, I ended up assisting in the install to facilitate the process. Installing the gateway and the X1 box myself as well as the set top boxes. I finally could turn on a TV and see something. But temporarily. The line was bad and had to be replaced. I had no user name or password to access Comcast for billing information. I make regular automatic payments via my bank every month. I was charged (double-charged actually) for installation, totaling 261.00. Who charges that for an install when they basically did more time talking on the phone while the customer installs themselves? Every month I am charged a late fee because Comcast does not post my payments for 10-14 days after electronic transmission from my bank. I have never received the services I contracted for in my sales agreement. When calling, all I hear is pay more and more. Last month they cut off my services despite receiving over 300.00 in payments from me, which incidentally did not post until the day after I was forced to make an additional payment to restore services. I pay my contracted amount every month, Comcast delays posting every month, generating additional income in the form of late fees. Calling Customer Services always takes me out of the country with the same rehearsed speech. I have filed a complaint with the FCC, my local government and here. Oh, and they converted my no commitment sales contract into a 24-month commitment due to POLICY changes. Their business practices are short of legal. If you have any other option available to you for internet and cable, please use them. Comcast is the worst nightmare of a company I have ever dealt with in my adult life. To date, I have paid 1188.68 to Comcast over a period of 8 months, and today Customer Service still claims I have a past due balance with them. As I have never seen a bill, nor been able to login to access this bill, I have no idea what they are billing me for. But it certainly is not the amount stated on the contract, nor do I get those services stated on the contract."
"Marta of Mendham, NJ",7/16/2015,,"We contracted COMCAST for cable/internet/phone for our summer home on LBI, NJ in mid-May. A temporary cable line was run from the telephone pole to the house, and I was told a team would come in 2-3 weeks to bury it. As of today, July 16th, I still have the wire above ground. We have been calling customer service for 2 months now, who give us a lot of promises, but no resolutions. The tree work that we needed done had to be rescheduled, and we have renters due in the house in 1 1/2 weeks. I have spent countless hours on the phone looking for resolution -- we get ""tickets"" generated and then they enter the COMCAST black hole. I finally called corporate today. Now I have a ""corporate ticket."" Hope this ticket can bypass that black hole. COMCAST has certainly earned its awful ratings. I figured with the new management that they were going to remake themselves and I gave them a shot. I wish that I didn't. "
"Christian of Pittsburgh, PA",7/16/2015,,"I ordered the X1 package online then had it tweaked over the phone after speaking with one of the Comcast CSRs. It was installed 6/12/15. The installation was seamless and the tech was awesome. I was not given any paperwork other than a remote instruction manual. I read it. I still had questions about my service. Call #1 was at 11:15P EDT. I spoke with a man who couldn't find my account and transferred me to a ""X1"" support rep. This was a female. After about 5 minutes of authentication and trying to find who I was, she was able to answer some questions. She kept placing me on hold or something, not sure if she was in training. Doesn't matter... after about 5 minutes of questions the line went silent. I stayed on for a few minutes and dead air... nothing. It disconnected after about 3 minutes of this. Call duration was 20 minutes. I called back at 11:36P EDT. This time I somehow routed my way to being on hold. Music playing. I sat on hold for 15 minutes according to my call log. Call DISCONNECTED and I never spoke with a human. I called back for the third time and they were closed. Once this happened, I did some research online on the best way to get assistance. I searched Google for 'Email Addresses For Comcast Executives' and found a list of email addresses on Consumerist.com. I then proceeded to file a BBB complaint. Once the complaint was filed, I referenced the number in a scathing email to the executives and sent it out. Their executive relations team contacted me and the tech manager for my area showed up at my door the very next day with his contact info and cell number on the back of his card. The ONLY thing these conglomerates understand are complaints lodged with third parties (BBB, FCC, Attorney General in your state) and when their executives are emailed directly."
"Adam of Portland, TN",7/17/2015,,"Signed up for Blast 75Mbps service at $39.99, Comcast changed it. I have a confirmation in writing: ""XFINITY Internet Blast! Internet Promotional Rate. Promotional Rate for 12 months."" When they installed, speed test showed 29Mbps. Called customer service immediately and they say we are signed up for Performance Internet. They say they will not provide the original agreement and we would have to sign up for a different package. I cancelled the same day."
"Jeffrenia of Phila , PA",7/17/2015,,"My family and I have been customers with Comcast for many years. When Comcast just started, they were a really good company. As years went on, they got worse and worse. They have the WORSE customer service team. Their information is never, ever accurate. Every time you call, they always give you different information. Not one representative never gave me correct info. Their bills are always wrong. They never keep their promises or commitments. They never call back when they say they will. They charge sooo much. Worse of all, they have horrible service. Especially the Internet. I feel like I'm on dial-up."
"Sorrelle of Evanston, IL",7/17/2015,,I called Comcast/Xfinity in the middle of June regarding the slow speed of our internet service. The agent immediately said she would send someone out. SHE DID NOT TELL ME THERE WOULD BE A $70.00 CHARGE. The service person came and told me there wasn't anything he could do. And if I wanted faster speed I should try taking my laptop to the modem and sit next to it! I called to complain when I saw that there was a charge for that visit. The rep said she'd see if they would remove it because I wasn't informed of the charge beforehand. Never heard back. Called back today and was told they'd give me a $20.00 credit and that I'd have to pay the rest. My contract is up in December and I am choosing to end my service with them and get rid of Xfinity altogether! I'll use Roku for everything. Poor Comcast they don't make enough $$$???!!!
"Benjamin of Abingdon, MD",7/17/2015,,"I recently moved to a new address so I needed to set up internet and TV. The two monopolies own the lines to the house so I had few options: either Comcast Xfinity or Verizon FiOS. I did my research and elected to go with Comcast for their product as well as the fact that the previous homeowners used their service. As I'm told, the house is already wired for it. It took two weeks calling local and national service representatives to take my order and open an account. The first representative presented me with several packages. I wanted to consult with my wife before committing and he wanted to earn my business so he gave me a personal email address to contact when we reached a decision. He never responded to that email. I gave a second email and allowed a two-day grace period with no response. The next representative I spoke with had me on hold for an hour due to ""heavy volume"" that day. He arranged the same package, created an account for me, and said I would receive a call from Comcast to schedule installation. No follow through. More days passed and I never received a callback so I initiated a follow-up. The third representative I spoke with said that an account was never created for me and no order ever went out. I tried a third time to arrange service and she tried to offer me the same package at a higher rate. Naturally, I refused. A fourth representative finally carried through on the basic task of taking my order and creating an account. She said that I did not need a tech to come to the house since a previous owner had subscribed to Comcast. In fact, she could waive the installation fee so long as I could drive two towns over to the local Comcast distribution/customer support center to pick up my self-install kit. Great! Worth the savings. I did that, but when I followed the instruction manual my modem would not go online. Tried every outlet in the house, spoke with three technical support agents, and went through troubleshooting for nearly three hours. After assuring me that my house had active service and it must be faulty equipment, nobody could solve the problem. They finally agreed to send a technician to the house but couldn't schedule an appointment for a week, which pushed me to 3 1/2 weeks in a new home without service. I went back to the local distribution/customer support center and requested an earlier appointment. Despite having more than a dozen vehicles in their lot and uniformed men outside their door, they insisted that they could not schedule an appointment from their offices. They reinforced the notion that service at my address was never disconnected and therefore still active at my house, insisting that it must be a bad modem. Their solution was to try to sell me on a new modem, which I refused, since all the troubleshooting over the phone suggested that the device itself was working properly. Called the national customer service hotline again and FINALLY had a capable representative who immediately looked at his records and told me that my service was NOT active and needed to be connected at the ""tap."" He arranged an earlier appointment time, but still has me waiting for several days and without internet for a total of 3 weeks. My business has suffered, my wedding plans have been stalled, my reputation with prospective employers has suffered, and I have had to find alternative, inconvenient ways to pay some of my bills. Three weeks of incompetence, misinformation, lack of follow through, and shady salesmen leads me to give Comcast an angry, dismal review. I hope their product turns out better than their customer service and technical support... when I'm finally connected."
"Cyndi of Clovis, CA",7/18/2015,,"I have been a loyal Comcast customer for many years but I'm tired of being lied to, overbilled & taken advantage of so am finally cancelling my service in hopes that my next provider has a policy in place that demands fair/honest interactions with its customers. In my opinion, Comcast deploys fraudulent, inconsistent sales/billing tactics to hook in and then gouge their customers. And although they may (if backed into a corner) admit the customer was promised something very different than what they actually received, they steadfastly refuse to hold themselves accountable in any way or do right by the customer by removing extra charges the customer incurs as a result. This leads to inconsistent, unpredictable bills & confusion for the customer & when the customer calls Comcast to try to make sense of their over-inflated bills they are often given conflicting, inaccurate info. If you call Comcast 5 times with the same issue, you can count on being given 5 different answers from 5 different reps. The customer is unable to pin down or obtain in writing specifics pertaining to their inconsistent billing, leading to confusion & mistrust which I believe is why Comcast has the worst cust. service satisfaction rating of all cable companies.The sales staff offers very good deals in order to get prospective customers to sign up for their products but once billed, the customer discovers they are paying far more than the amounts promised & finds they are being billed additional fees for services not made aware to them during the sales pitch. If the customer calls to refute the additional charges, Comcast will generally make lame excuses or try to circumvent the issue temporarily rather than correcting it so the problem never really goes away. e.g. I have been told: ""It's not possible such a deal was offered to you. It's not our policy to offer such deals"" & I replied: ""Nonetheless, such a deal WAS offered to me by a member of your sales staff & as a result of that conversation I signed up for service. I was told I would be billed x amount, that that rate would be locked in. My bill does not reflect what I was promised."" And then I heard: ""You must have misunderstood the information you were being told"" & I replied, ""That's not possible since I recorded everything the sales rep said on my computer during our conversation. If you doubt my word, pull up the recording you took for quality assurance purposes during that conversation which occurred ** date & time for proof of what was offered & the agreed upon deal/pricing."" ""Oh no, we can't do that"" Then I heard: ""Whoever told you that was mistaken. They should not have offered you that deal"". ""Ok"" I said, ""then what will be done to rectify this situation?"" ""There's nothing we can do, you must pay the price in your bill or face having it go to collections"" ""I can give you ____ (fill in the blank with some off-the-wall small temporary perk or discount like $5 of your modem rental for a month.)""I believe they employ these practices intentionally hoping the customer will give up out of frustration over time & just pay whatever is billed them regardless of accuracy in order to save hours of time haggling on the phone with uninformed cust. service reps who continually fail to resolve the issues long term. The biggest complaint I have with Comcast comes down to ethics about the way they conduct business & interact with their customers. If I were a business owner & had in my employ a sales staff & one day a customer called to check the price of a product & was inaccurately told it sold for roughly half the price it should be resulting in a sale. Then the customer is sent a bill for the full price of the item. After receiving the bill the customer calls & says ""I was told I would be paying ** for this product so I bought it but I'm being billed for much more."" If this happened to me, I would question the employee about the price he quoted the customer for the product & if he did indeed offer it at a price lower than the sales price I would hold my employee responsible for the error, or myself responsible for not training the employee properly, but what I would NOT do is hold the customer responsible nor expect him to pay full price for the item as a result of our mistake. I would absorb the cost of the mistake my company made & give the product to the customer at the price they were quoted. But not Comcast, they expect the customer to pay for their mistakes & misdealings with customers & unfairly punish customers monetarily for believing the disingenuous promises they make. In my opinion this is unethical, fraudulent, criminal business practice. Goodbye Comcast."
"V. W. of Sacramento, CA",7/18/2015,,"I didn't pay my bill for 2m, this I acknowledge! But what I didn't know was the security system was wholly dependent on said internet. When I went to pay the bill, all of my information is gone! When I get a call from them they tell me 600 - they added a month to my bill that I would have not been able to access because all service had been disconnected! Now the security system they offer is dependent on the Internet service. As a result - when I called the system says 600, but the customer service says 1k!I called them 3x one day the. Noon the next trying to speak with the guy who initiated all that! He claimed he called all of June trying to reach me and leaving voicemails - no calls or voicemails on my phone! He even said he called the 29th - nothing! They were quick to send me to collections though - they were calling before I even got the bill! Now I have emailed the office of the president 3x this week and nothing! Initially, I wanted to reduce it down to the internet, but 3 generic email answers later I'm done with this company! Now I just want to pay my 2 months and not look back! Should have learned the first time! The battle continues..."
"Carol of Mobile, AL",7/18/2015,,"I had an appointment for this past Tuesday. The ""technician"" drove down the street, turned around and didn't stop. When I called, I was told that nobody was home. I rescheduled for today. The Tech showed up, switched out the boxes (again) and told me to wait a few minutes for the ""On Demand"" service to work. I was told to call him if it didn't work after a few minutes. I called twice, no answer and left a message. No return call. I just got off the phone (again) with a Comcast rep. and was told someone might be out before 8 tonight or first thing in the morning. It's pitiful and expensive service and I guess I will have to cancel service with them and go with another company."
"wen of Philadelphia, PA",7/19/2015,,"I transferred my internet service by talking with a online representative. In the new apt, the internet just doesn't work. I called more than 5 times, spoke with different representatives and finally got an appointment. Not only no one showed up for no reason, I didn't receive any call from their technician to tell me at least the appointment was cancelled. The representative doesn't have contact information of the technician either. I've been waiting the whole afternoon during weekend! Horrible service!"
"Charlene of Franklin, KY",7/19/2015,,"I've called a thousand times, HATE all that automated CRAP to go through. Finally get a person and they hang up. I wasn't cussing or anything, just mad cause I waited sooo long. This has happened 7 times this past week. This is gonna be over soon."
"David of Muskegon, MI",7/19/2015,,"We have been Comcast customers for many years. All of our interactions with the people in the local Comcast offices in Muskegon Heights have been very good. Telephone calls to the Comcast help line have been exceptionally bad. The impression we have had is that the agents are well trained in the ""how dare you call me for service"" schools. No service appears to be possible without responses to: Customer Name and address on your account, Customer number, Digital box numbers effected, Social Security number, Amount of last payment.Yesterday's occurrence was to report that our Channel 3 had no audio for at least a couple of hours. Then, the video came on and the audio went away. This was on our three TVs. After we provided the answers to the questions Comcast asked, the operator hung up. It really does not make my life better to call Comcast, it only adds to the frustration as the Service people continually suggest that any problem you may be experiencing is caused by the customer.There should be no problem getting new employees to help with Comcast service, as people who exhibit these negative traits are increasingly being terminated by other firms. NO THANK YOU COMCAST, YOU NEED A REAL COMPETITOR."
"Steve of Alvin, TX",7/19/2015,,We had them for 6 months. Not one of the services we had worked over a week at time without problems. Customer service could not help or didn't understand problem and offered to reset boxes. Had repair out 4 times in 6 months. Finally just gave up and went with another provider.
"mary of Princess Anne, MD",7/19/2015,,"After 45 minutes on the phone with TA, I was told we needed a new cable box. The closest store was 20 miles away but closed at 1:00 in Salisbury MD. It was Saturday. I work full time and have only the weekend to take care of this. Hopped in the car and got to the place at 12:57 (phone satellite time). Clerks had already locked the door and would not wait on me. They walked by the door, chatted on the phone, etc. I knocked for a while hoping they would help me but the continued on their cell phones and chatting with one another. Clearly they just wanted to leave early and could not have cared less about the customer as it takes about 2 minutes to exchange a cable box.Iâ€™ve been in a similar situation and would never have closed early or refused to wait on a customer. Hoping to follow up so that management is aware of the poor service of these staff."
"Christopher of Keasbey, NJ",7/19/2015,,"I wanted to set up tv, internet, and phone in my new apartment, so I went online on a Monday and signed up for the Comcast Triple Play. Once online, I scheduled an appointment for an installer to come in on that Sunday and set it up for me. I paid my 100 dollar activation fee and was under the impression that I was on my way to having these services taken care of. Two days later I received a call that there was a problem with my order and I had to pay an additional 29 dollars to keep the same package that I ALREADY SIGNED UP FOR. So I said no problem I will pay the 29 dollars, then he said well your appointment for Sunday has to be changed, to which I replied can I install the equipment myself and he said yes I will ship it to you one day delivery.Three days go by and I still have no phone, no internet, and no cable. I call up and after waiting on hold for half hour I am told that I never completed the third party verification and my equipment is on hold until this takes place... I was NEVER told anything about any of that! Finally, I say that this is ridiculous, the least you can do is credit me the extra 29 dollars you tacked on at the last minute. They said that's what the charge is for, the next day shipping! Oh! The next day shipping that I was told would be there on Thursday??? Because it's Saturday and nothing has been accomplished! I was it waived or I will cancel my order and that's exactly what I did, over 29 dollars you lost a two year contract! Great customer service **."
"Saffiatu of Peabody, MA",7/19/2015,,I went to Comcast office and I ask if I can pay my final bill but the guy told me that he was going to mail it to me to my new address. I received a bill for $345.00 and I paid that bill because I thought it was my final bill and all of a sudden I found another final bill for 97.36 within two weeks of paying. I called customer service and talked to a guy name Net and explained to him about my reason for calling that I received a letter from credit bureau about the $97.36 and he hanged up on me. I was really surprise and mad that I never even received notice from them that I owe them money. I always pay my bill on time and I don't believe that it was necessary for them to take it that far for only $97.36. BE AWARE OF COMCAST BECAUSE WHAT THEY TELL IS NOT WHAT THEY DO. Make sure to record them when you have them on the phone. 
"Kelly of Pontiac, , MI",7/20/2015,,"Customer placed on hold over 30 minutes waiting to talk to comcast rep. 1.) Conversation interrupted frequently several times during conversation. Each time dialed for reconnect, a long time waiting period (over 30- minutes). 2.) Recording voice process flawed ""limited choices to solution."" 3.) Voice refers to comcast rep. 4.) Additional waiting time - over 30 minutes waiting time again. There were 3-day wait before my problem was solved!! And service interrupted (3) days."
"Karen of Goodlettsville, TN",7/20/2015,,"Let me start off by saying I've been a customer of Comcast for at least 10 years, but I'm at my boiling point with this company. I got my services upgraded Feb. 2015, when the tech came to my home - I ran to Walmart to purchase my own modem. He installed my new modem. I asked him to take back some remote a small digital box from a second TV and the Comcast Modem. When I got my next bill I noticed that they still was charging me for the second digital box and the modem. I call Comcast with this complaint and they credited my bill for the current bill and the next bill (the second bill was printed by then). Everything was good for a couple of months - then once again I was hit with an Comcast modem charge of 10.00. I called again and they suggested that I send them a receipt of me giving the Tech the Modem. By this time I'm livid. Some after several calls back and forth, I faxed over the receipt thinking this ordeal was over. Several days later I get a call from a rep from Comcast stating that since there isn't a serial number on the receipt, so I'm still responsible for the modem. I'm at a lost for words with them - meanwhile on my Comcast Bill it states Customer Owned Modem $0.00, Comcast Modem $10.00. At this point I've been paying the full bill, while fighting Comcast trying to get this resolved. I even suggested that Comcast look at the data information from the Modem to see if it's being used for the location. I think the Tech took the Modem for his own uses and I'm paying for it. I will find every Comcast address for Customer Service and send a well documented letter until I get an answer."
"Barry of Glen Burnie, MD",7/20/2015,,"I had service problems with Comcast. I talked to neighbors and a lot of them were changing to Verizon because of poor service and outages. I switched to Verizon, cancelled Comcast, and took my equipment back to Comcast and wanted to pay my last bill due July 1 2015. They said I could not pay there - they would mail my last bill. It was prepared July 7 2015 and I got it in the mail July 14 2015. Then on July 20 2015 I get a call at work from a collection agency to collect a bill for Comcast. They are retaliating against customers who cancel and go with another provider because so many people are doing it because Comcast cannot keep their customers happy. I was with them many years and NEVER missed a payment. Verizon makes switching very easy, try them you won't be sorry."
"allen of Wallingford, CT",7/20/2015,,"Absolute WORST cable service and customer service I have EVER had the displeasure of dealing with. Wifi is complete garbage that repeatedly gains and loses signal, making doing anything impossible. Also, we have been awaiting delivery of DVRs that were supposed to be here three weeks ago. I have no idea how Comcast is still in business. I will be discontinuing my service prior to the 30-day mark and urge all customers to switch to a service that works."
"Ryan of Brookline, MA",7/21/2015,,"Absolute worst customer service I have ever had. They transfer you to three separate people with thick accents and terrible reception who need you to tell them the information over and over again until they go, ""Oh, it looks like it's expired/not available/out of service."" SWITCH to another to provider and break up their monopoly. Please."
"Mathew of Bellingham, WA",7/21/2015,,"I've been a Comcast person my whole life but independently for 20+ years. Yeah they are expensive but it's Comcast and they are West Coast! Well unfortunately... for the 2+ years I've had the Xfinity service. Service has been spotty (and that's being nice). Every time I call them they act like it's the first time I call about issues. I've had multiple technicians out, repairmen out. They've hooked up my TV's non-HD. They've put in boosters, replaced boosters, told me I had to buy internet boosters, ran temp cables, repaired cables. I've been told repairman will be out and they don't show - ""never scheduled.""Then after I call and complain they come out and repair an issue but then say there is still an issue, but that's someone else's job. Then someone else stops by and says they fixed the issue but nothing is fixed. I'm charged for a service that is spotty and does not work like it should.There is never, and I mean never, a Supervisor on shift to talk to. I get the ""We'll put in your request to talk to one and one will call you back. What number would you like them to call you at."" Not one call back from anyone. And I know they are documented because they tell me ""I see you've requested to talk to a Supervisor.""During football season I have 6 TV's in my house, 3 full time. I try to be nice but I've been without phone, cable and Internet, sometimes all at the same time. I have a 3 year old, it's a safety issue not to have phone service! Believe it or not, this is a short review. Feel free to ask details. I unfortunately will most likely be swapping services. :-("
"Karen of Alpharetta , GA",7/21/2015,,"I had an alarm system installed almost 2 years ago and the contract is for 36 months. I was told that if I moved I could take it with me which was fine. But I asked if where I move does not offer Xfinity service will I still have to pay the early termination fee? I was told no. That was a flat out lie. I am moving to a location that does not offer service. I would be happy to set it up but how can I if it's not offered. Now I'm being told I have to pay $400 early termination fee. This is so wrong if I can't install it to keep it where I am moving. Then I asked if I just paid the monthly alarm charge until contract is up and they said ""you will have to keep it installed at the location you are at."" Which part of I am not going to be living here do you not understand."
"Jessica of Tallahass Ee, FL",7/22/2015,,Try this is one of the worst cable companies ever. The worst customer service. They owe me 93.00 but doesn't want to pay me backâ€¦ I hate this company and the rude people that work there.
"Monty of Loveland, CO",7/22/2015,,"First they my cable boxes and Wi-Fi spot of five myself and said it was sure fun I can do that. Then come to find out my new house isn't ready so they have to send somebody out and that takes about a week after he gets there. There is a cable going through my backyard and my neighbors yard. I have to Call to find out somebody was coming in about another week to bury the cable. Then I get my first bill after about three weeks of service bill is supposed to be $85 per month and I get charged over $200 first Bill. They said they charge me for the first month and the next month in advance which I wasn't told in the beginning. When I tell them that I want to cancel the TV service and just keep the Internet service, they tell me, ""it will be quadruple the price for Internet service."" And then they act like they don't care I'm canceling my service and tell me that I have to send back all the boxes but they won't send information on how to do that. I have never done a review before but have never seen or had such bad service before."
"J of Shelby Township, MI",7/22/2015,,"Signed up for 2 services at 2 different locations. One signed up for the $39.99 that included their performance internet of 25Mb and digital converter with Showtime and Streampix for 12 months. At my other location, I signed up for the $49.99 plan with the Plus Blast internet of 75Mb and digital converter with HBO and Streampix. During the online sign up, decided to take another digital converter as it showed $0.00 charge for an additional converter. The next morning I received 2 emails for each sign up, one price was increased from $39.99 to $44.99. The 2nd one, there was an additional charge of $9.95/month for the 2nd digital converter and $10/month for the speed increase (speed that they're offering, there was no increase).This company is a greedy vulture. Even online, when you have screenshots of your orders, they try to screw you. Well, good thing is that I have options for service providers and it was a no brainer to call them immediately and cancel the service orders. You'd think they'd actually try and do business honestly, even when they know people have options. This is exactly why I canceled them last year. Take one service, get a bill for something else. Their customer service is clearly taught to lie to people just like their online services are set up to mislead."
"Katherine C of Jacksonville, FL",7/22/2015,,"I went online to sign up for new service with Comcast. I found a plan on the Comcast site and signed up through a chat group with their customer service rep, and installation was not available for a week and a half. Disappointed, but had no choice. Then, I was called a week later by their customer service department, letting me know that the plan I was signed up for was not available in my area and it was canceled, along with my installation date. I then signed up for another plan that cost more money and was given another install date further out. Then, today I received an email reminding me of my installation date that indicated the original date. I called and found out they had me signed up for the wrong plan I agreed to that cost even more money. I'm very frustrated with Comcast. Their customer service reps are idiots. They are supposed to come tomorrow night to install the new service, and I know what I signed up for, but have no idea what I am going to get. The good thing is I did not sign up for a contract. I'm not locked in, so I can cancel at any time. Horrible company to deal!!"
"sandy of Orlando, FL",7/24/2015,,"I manage 50 vacations homes in Orlando area. We used to have trouble with internet phone and cable services with all the providers in the areaâ€¦ but COMCAST is the worst. It makes 5 days we have No service at all (cable internet and phone) in one of our home. I called them 10 times staying over the phone around 5 hours. I went to their store to change the box but like it was not working. I took an appointment with a technician who came to said he can't do nothing, he had to put a special work order. So 72h later we still wait the technicians to replace the outside line.You never know when they are coming. No open windows time, so you should stay at home and waiting their call because you HAVE TO BE HERE. As a vacation home, clients have to be able to call 911 if something happens. With no phone line, no internet it is hard to give a call. Unfortunately COMCAST is the only provider in this area, but as soon as there will be a new one, be sure I close my account right away."
"FRANK of West Paducah, KY",7/24/2015,,"I have had Comcast for 15 years, for most of this time service has been satisfactory. That is until I received my bill today. They had increased it by $15.00, apparently by adding HBO and renaming my package without my knowledge or consent. Their explanation was that due to their increased costs they had to increase rates in my area, and that in order to make my ""viewing experience"" more enjoyable they added HBO. WHAT A CROCK! With this line of thought I guess they get HBO free. Internet is mainly what I want anyway and there are other alternatives fortunately. For the most part TV sucks, reruns and reality. I find streaming more enjoyable on the TV's apps than cable anyway."
"Dore of Broomfield, CO",7/24/2015,,"Phone call to ask about why my rate was increasing every month. ""Sarah"" offered me a lower rate with new services that included phone service. Explained to Sarah I appreciated the lower rate however phone service was not needed. Sarah asked if I need new equipment. No, equipment I have is working just fine. Days later received a big box of new equipment. Called and spoke with ""Marius"" who apologized and said all I needed to do was open the box, get the return address label out, repackage and take to UPS for return. Opened the box - no return address label. Called, spoke with ""Ann"" who said it was my responsibility to return the equipment and if I didn't I would be charged. Asked Ann if it could be picked up. I see their trucks in my complex every week. Yesâ€¦and it will be a $35 charge for them to pick it from me. Asked for supervisor. Spoke to ""Dan"" who said I did not need to open the box, there is no return address label inside, just return to UPS and say I refuse to accept the shipment and have it returned. Called UPS, they are not sure this is what they can do as the package was signed for and accepted. I will need to drive to a location to find out based on how the box is labeled. Filed a complaint with the FCC."
"mike of Portage, IN",7/25/2015,,Have had Comcast for almost two months. I've experienced constant connection problems with buffering and just getting kicked off altogether. I've called once to fix it and will call again. I've also ran speed tests on Internet and I'm only getting 30 mbps... My Internet package is the 50 mbps. Oh yeah... Recently the ceo of Comcast sent a letter congratulating me on receiving their new blast.. Now my Internet will be 75 mbps. What a joke. These ** people are something else. This Internet sucks right now and I'll be back on here after I talk to them again. I've had plenty of experience with Comcast and I ** loathe them... with a passion but they're the only game in town..... Just love it.
"Debra of Coconut Creek, FL",7/25/2015,,"I've been trying to speak with someone at Comcast for 2 weeks, they charged me the wrong amount, corrected it and then re-set even a larger amount. I've been on hold for 48 mins trying to speak with someone again. They are the worst, not the first time I had this issue. They added someone else's bill to my account because our phone number was similar, how dumb is that for a huge company like this."
"Chad of Evanston, IL",7/25/2015,,Comcast has to come to my house 3 times after I moved to get my xfinity cloud working correctly. I took two days off of work and spent over 5 hours on the phone with completely helpless and awful reps. The supervisors are condescending and completely unwilling to help. Not their problem is what I heard. Now I am being charged $119 for their visits. I am changing to Dish! Maybe they will appreciate my $220 a month business. Promised two separate call backs from managers but that never happened. First guy who came to install was mad it was a 3:00 appointment and required a new cable outlet. He proceeded to smoke in my backyard and complain via obscenities around my children for the first half hour. Next guy who came out blamed it on AT&T and did nothing. He was absolutely clueless. Last appointment was late and gave us the wrong box. Way too expensive monthly payment for disrespectful and incompetent responses from Comcast. I am done!
"Gary of Cape Coral, FL",7/25/2015,,"While living in Immokalee, FL - 10 months - I had excellent service with Xfinity. No contract, excellent TV package and internet. When it was time to move, NO hassles. Thank you Xfinity. I did not realize at the time that each box (had 2) had to be programmed to record whatever you wanted on that channel instead of being able to program either and see recording on either. This was the only snag. Be sure to ask for the whole house DVR. I would use Xfinity again with that information."
"Ben of Sycamore, IL",7/26/2015,,"Comcast sells different tiers of Internet speed that never as fast as advertised. I pay $85/mo for 75 mbps internet; usually I have 20 mbps, and often only 5 mbps(!). Comcast offers to send a service person out, for a charge, and tells me that ""Internet speeds are not guaranteed."" HOW CAN YOU SELL DIFFERENT SPEEDS THEN? The only way to get their attention is to make a complaint to the FCC (which the FCC recommends)."
"Terry of Morganza, MD",7/26/2015,,"I had called Comcast to try and get my monthly bill reduced. The lady was very nice and suggested I upgrade to the X1 box. I could save around $20.00 a month. Now the nightmare begins. On the they were suppose to install the new box, they call and cancel. Reschedule for two days later. Two days later they call again and cancel. You would think they would put a note out there saying ""make sure we get this customer taken care of today as we already canceled once."" They give you this four hour window which can really screw up your work day. When I try to call they have this annoying automated voice system. They want you to say what you need help with but cannot recognize what you say. Useless. I finally get through to a person and they apologize, and promise a $20.00 credit. Wow, $20.00 when I probably lost $600.00 in wages since I missed work for two days. By the way, I have yet to see this credit. They then tell me I can pick up the box at their office, and return my equipment after I install the new box. I travel 30 minutes to get to the office and they tell me that they cannot give me a box until I bring in my other boxes. Well at this point I decided to drop Comcast TV and Voice. The internet is cable, reliable and the fastest around. This is the only thing this company has going for it. Without the internet, they would be out of business. I am now a satellite TV and VOIP phone customer and very happy I made the change. The thing is, they really don't care."
"ratna of Philadelphia, PA",7/27/2015,,"June 25, after attempt to self connect the internet myself, not working. June 30 I call Comcast. A lady ask me to do phone trouble shooting, still not working, so she said the modem defective, she will send me another one in 3~5 business days. After 1 week did not receive. I call, they said sometimes it takes longer. Another week (so it is 2 week) I called back because still did not receive the modem. The CS said, that he cannot locate any order sent out, so he said there is no modem sent out yet, because he just found the work order. I request to talk to Supervisor. The Supervisor talk to me and give me solution that the next Monday (I called on Saturday), tech will come to my house at 7~8 am. Monday morning my sister in law wait on the sofa next to front door from 6:30 am to 9:30 am, nobody come. She even called me if I give them the right address, I said yes.So when I came home the next Sunday July 26 I called Comcast. She said she only have next appt on August 3. I said I need it earlier because it's more than a month to connect my service and my daughter need to finish her homework on early August. ""And why the tech not come?"" She cannot answer. I ask for Supervisor. The Supervisor need me to review everything of my story again, but he keep cutting the story, and when I ask if the Comcast tech really came to my house that Monday, he answer, ""I cannot say yes or no."" I don't even know what that means so I ask a higher manager to talk, But He (initial D) insist that he is the one who responsible to solve my problem, and refuse to let me talk to someone else. So I said I cannot understand him, and I ask ""should I just close my account?"" He said ""you can do it, if that's what you want to do"" and he said he's going hang up on me because I cannot talk the higher manager. Only they the one who can call me. So he hang up on me. Around 10 minutes later he (initial D) the same person call me back at a more calm voice (he was aggressive on the first call) and said that's the earliest appt he can give to me but he don't even have the early morning. So he even can only give me the next day August the 4th morning and warn me if 7~9 its mean the tech can come at 9 and I have to answer their phone call and that they can finish the job for hours and hours later so I have to be ready to stay home all the hours. Which is mean he warn me I cannot go to work. He keep insist he is in the right position after fail to connect my internet for more than a month.This is a ridiculous situation and not even one word of sorry they said and keep arguing with me after keep breaking all their promise. So watch out customers."
"Denise of Salem, OR",7/27/2015,,After the Net neutrality took effect. Comcast has found other ways in ripping you off. I did a new package Feb 2015 and got HBO as part of the package deal for 2 years. For the last 8 years 2 DVR's cost $9.95 and now ($29.85) They took HBO off too. March Bill- $140. April Bill- $128. May-$133. June- $133. July-$186. New Bill $184. WTH?
"Shrikant of Pembroke Pines, FL",7/28/2015,,"I got Comcast internet with telephone this month for the first time. To avoid monthly modem fees I opted to buy modem on my own and Comcast rep suggested me to buy DOCSIS 3 modem before the technician visit for set up. On visit the technician suggested the Netgear modem Docsis 3 was not suitable and suggested me to buy another modem with Wifi networking. He suggested that I use their modem till I replace and then we can set up by phone call to service center.I bought a brand new Arris TG862G modem - same model as the one installed by Comcast technician. On setting up on phone Comcast was not able to get the modem work. They asked us to replace it again. We did that and called again. They still were not able to get it connected after 75 minutes on phone and said they will have to send technician again. Today they informed that there will be a $39 fee to visit as the modem is not owned by Comcast. After making us replace modem 3 times.It looks like it is a deliberate trick by Comcast forcing us to use their modem for which they charge monthly. The customer service today were very rude. On asking them to connect to their supervisor, he flatly refused saying he know his job and there is no option but to pay - almost blackmailing us. As a new customer I am very disillusioned by Comcast, especially the way the customer reps talked today. No wonder they are top of the list in the worst customer service companies."
"Ramesh of Aurora, IL",7/28/2015,,"I had blast for over 2 years. Recently Comcast increased my price to $70 from $40 and told me that my speed is increased to 75 mbps. In reality I was only getting 1.5-2 mbps. I contacted service just to go through the monkey drill of power off, disconnect etc., nothing changed except that the support said sorry and disconnected abruptly."
"doris of Savannah, GA",7/28/2015,,"On the line for five hours, trying to restore cable and internet which were not working when we arrived home this afternoon. Could only reach operators in the Philippines and could not get any help in the US. Transferred many times, left on hold, with no ability to solve our problems. We rely on the internet for our medical record work--we are both doctors. No help was given, and one gentleman I reached did suggest a temporary connection to xfinity hotspot, which is not a secure network. I was told that customer service would call back in 30 minutes. It is two hours later, and of course, no one has called. Why can't they have local US telephone numbers where a customer can call and receive appropriate service?I am lodging a complaint with the FCC, which I believe, will follow up with my concerns. What does a patient do who relies on the internet to send reports back to a doctor or hospital? This service is really an abomination, and the system is very broken. If I treated my patients this way, I wouldn't be in business. How do we reach this monopoly and change their customer service? They must have gotten this message before. What is the problem?"
"Eagle of The Woodlands, TX",7/28/2015,,"We reported service issues 8 times in 2 months. The Internet went out on 7/20. We called and they told us there was a signal issue in our area. They scheduled a service call for 7/23. No one showed or called. We scheduled again for Tuesday 7/28 between 10-12. No show and no call by 11 so I called and they said they had it scheduled for Wednesday 7/29 between 10-12. I insisted on a service call for the day they promised, 7/28. We will see if they do it. On 5 different calls I was told it was fixed or would be fixed. Three times I made appointments. Worst customer service."
"Bliss of Plymouth, MI",7/28/2015,,I was out of town when this bill was due and missed the payment. They are charging me 30% of my bill because I'm 7 days late. There are other companies....
"mary of Houston, TX",7/28/2015,,"My bill is inflated every month. I was told by and have a recording of a Comcast employee stating that my bill should never be over 158.00 a month. This month it was $261.00. Whenever I call Comcast they reduce my bill without question. They are making a fortune on people who do not call them on their overcharges. 1/15-$194.61 (PAID$157.54), 4/15$177.95, 5/15-$191.83. I didn't call them on the last 2 bills listed because I was in the hospital. Today they reduced my 7/8 bill from $261.90 to $167.07."
"Judy of New Castle, DE",7/28/2015,,"Someone needs to investigate the practices of Comcast. I am a long time customer and aside from the customer service you get on the phone, the service has been good. However, since I started receiving letters and emails regarding the new modem, I have noticed a decided change in my response time. My internet is slower in connecting. Even when I use my landline, which I must have for my security system which is not thru Comcast, there is a delay after I dial a number before it connects. I do not believe in coincidence so my only conclusion is that Comcast is manipulating my service levels and response time. This is a deceptive business practice. I do not believe for one minute that the modem I have has suddenly become obsolete or incompatible. Comcast is stealing money from its customers and the regulators are looking the other way."
"Jerry of West Palm Beach, FL",7/28/2015,,I was lied to by service reps of Comcast four times from the Philippines to Mexico to Philadelphia to Jamaica. Comcast representatives lied regarding installations and credits for modems. I was then lied to three times by representatives in the Philadelphia executive office for customer relations. Finally I asked for a supervisor who was very nice and did nothing but transfer the call to my local Florida office who also lied. I have 4 hours of saved audio tape on this issue. My last call to Comcast I spoke with a Philadelphia corporate customer service supervisor who merely hung up the phone on me and refused to deal with the issue. Clearly Comcast has the worst customer service imaginable and has a policy of given all customers complete runaround technique. This time I have recorded evidence with dates and names. Looking forward to seeing how Comcast reacts if indeed I pursue the cause in court.
"Summer of Jacksonville, FL",7/28/2015,,"I hooked up Comcast when I moved recently. I actually had to move again a few weeks later, and Comcast failed to straighten out the bill between the two addresses. I've called them five times and had one chat session. Twice Comcast said they would fix my bill. Both times they did not, the charges went back on my bill. I was so frustrated I asked Comcast that in light of the time and hassle of trying to fix this bill over the course of two months that they zero out my account and start fresh from the current bill cycle, but they refused. They have shut my service off twice now and keep charging me reactivation and late fees. It's unbelievable that they treat people like this, that their customer service is so incredibly terrible, and that they refuse to right their own mistakes. I will happily pay more for another provider to escape Comcast."
"Bill of Fairport, NY",7/28/2015,,"I had a vacation home in Tennessee and had Comcast cable, internet and security service. I sold cabin and new owner wanted to keep exact services. Still had 2 years left on alarm system contract but new owner more than willing to assume contract. Comcast said only way they could do this was if we both went in person to their Knoxville office. He lived in Louisiana and I lived in New York. I was forced to drive 800 miles to sign a piece of paper. Even though they could verify me on the phone that was their policy. I would rather go without TV and internet than ever deal with this company again. The multiple service reps and managers I spoke to didn't care. This has got to be the worst company on the planet and I see why they consistently are ranked poorly in customer service. Hopefully technology will continue to advance and they will become a dinosaur in the not too distant future so no one has to suffer dealing with them."
"Dallas of Seattle, WA",7/28/2015,,"First of all when will it be possible to pick what channels you want and pay for only the channels you want. I am SICK AND TIRED of paying for foreign language channels. If people want other than English then pay for it. This is the United States, period. By the time I figure out what's on the program is 1/2 over. Don't need multiple shopping channels, multiple sports channels, multiple yap channels, UWTV etc. There are way too many crap channels and I mean crap. Don't need High Def, I was raised on rabbit ears. Paying $172+ for bundled service is crap. That's $2,000 a year for WHAT? 200+ channels that mean nothing to the average Joe. Comcast distributes popular channels within its bundles so you have to PAY additional money so you can have the channels that you want to watch then end up with multiple channels that are CRAP, and then you have to navigate around the crap channels. I hope Comcast implodes. Their customer service is horrible. They are way too big, too fast. I feel if a thousand people refuse to pay their bill I will join them."
"david of Atlanta, GA",7/29/2015,,"Every 3 to 4 months my monthly rate would go up anywhere from $2 to $5+ for small items such as increased fees for tv services, modem rent or other ""fees."" Each time I would call and get the rate reduced after 30 minutes of discussion. This is in spite of a fixed price. 4 months ago I had the price reduced (again) because now AT&T is in my neighborhood. I was quoted a great price for the: Triple play"". After 3 months the rate went up $5 due to various miscellaneous charges including an increase in the rental costs of the modems. Mine are nearly 4 years old. They could not explain why the cost on old equipment went up. I lost it and left! A human being shouldn't be forced to beg every 3 to 4 months. They are disgusting and I look forward to competition in that industry."
"DENNIS of Jacksonville , FL",7/29/2015,,"I went into an Xfinity store here in zip code 32225. In my hand was a promotional gift card for $250.00 or a Samsung Galaxy. I have that card right now in front of me. After three hours of debated and deciding, I said ""if I sign for this (contract) I would get my money Later?"" I ask for the third time and once again was told yes. I got my service started in December 2014. In April we received a card for $100.00 and they won't give me anything because my contract has 100.00 on it. I ask if they wanted the promotional card and they said they didn't need it. Well it's right in front of me now and nothing about $100.00 anywhere.I am waiting now for a service tech to arrive. He and the office told me he would definitely be there at 1 pm sharp. It's now 1:30 and I have a cell and landline phone about a half of arm's length away. I tried taking a survey and a robot voice mail hung up on me. Maybe it was mad I was giving one star for each category. DirecTV has customer service. Comcast pull the bait and switch and are very dishonest people. I have ask all families I have to purge their Comcast and go back to satellite. For you honest people out there, have a blessed Day."
"RAYLYN of Tacoma, WA",7/29/2015,,"Comcast charged us over 900 for a month of service! We upgraded to the x1 quad package, suppose to be 169.99. It's not... it's 179.99... plus 19.95 for the monitoring, plus a 10 hd fee. Nothing is what they say. We called and asked about the added prices, they conveniently activated the account then charged us over 400 to deactivate us. Plus they put the exact same package on bit over 215, plus charges that were insane! We've had them for over 20 years, it is so crushing to be forced into something now for 2 years and so far every bill is different! Why can't we cancel if they don't uphold their services... I don't get it."
"Travis of Rockville, MD",7/29/2015,,"On March 23, 2015 I returned a Comcast cable box to manager ** at 50 W Gude Dr Suite 60 Rockville, Maryland. We never had established service or used the service with Comcast at the ** address. I am the owner of this house. ** said he was going to take care of this account. He did not. I wrote a thank you note to ** and also to the CEO of the Comcast, Brian L. Roberts Comcast, CEO. I thought Comcast may have changed. I was wrong. Comcast is an incompetent, greedy, and terrible as ever. Today I received a collection from Southwest Credit for an unpaid bill of $36.91. Again, we never used the service for a single minute at this home. Comcast is rated the most hated company in the nation by Consumer Reports for good reason. It is a monopoly or duopoly that should be broken up like the phone company in the late 1970s."
"Michael of Charleston, SC",7/30/2015,,"My internet service has been unreliable for a majority of the 2 years since a move outside of AT&T range forced me back into Comcast Xfinity's monopoly. I'm on my 3rd rental modem, 3rd technician (2 no shows), and countless hours of phone calls. The customer service center seems designed to stall or aggravate you to hang up by having you repeat the same information many times, then keeping no account details when trying to reference previous calls, so you are always starting from scratch. Very frustrating to feel like Comcast is my only option and to be treated like they know it."
"Jason of Fort Wayne, IN",7/30/2015,,"First they sent me a converter box that I didn't ask for, then I was always dealing with outages. Now, I just got a collection notice for my last bill. I disconnected service 6/15/2015, the collection notice is dated 7/24/15. Why is it fair that they would send it to collections already? I'll add that when I called to disconnect, the CSA gave me the runaround until I said I was recording the conversation. Why can't Comcast give their customers what they want and not try to treat them like garbage?"
"Kristina of Antioch, CA",7/30/2015,,"Worst customer service and constantly adding on extra to the bill! I was promised one price and they keep adding on extra charges. Over the last two years I have had to call them many times due to adding $20 here and $40 there. I even have the paper showing they are supposed to charge the lower rate, but the customer service agents know they are the only high speed service here and don't care. I can't wait to move and never deal with this price gouging bait-and-switch company again. If you have any choice other than Comcast, take it!"
"don of Brentwood, TN",7/31/2015,,"So they tell me now that I'm getting 75 mbps internet speed. And often I do. But then again, often I end up with .35 mbps.. that's point 35. Slow enough that my internet service is useless and I have to leave my home to continue with my job. For years they have been coming to my house, trying to charge me $75 per trip to fix THEIR ISSUE. It's intermittently messed up so by the time they get around to helping me, it's ok again. And then they say things like, ""it's hard to fix something when it's ok when we get here."" (I send them speed reports to prove it was slow.) The supervisors say they will do what it takes to fix it and then they do nothing.When the techs get here they say things like, ""we saw the issues you are having in the office on our equipment so we know you are having issues"" but then nothing ever gets fixed. I'M SICK OF IT BUT I REFUSE TO GIVE UP. I DEMAND THAT I GET THE SERVICE THEY ARE CLAIMING THEY PROVIDE. AND I REFUSE TO GO TO A LESSER SPEED SYSTEM LIKE DISH OR AT&T."
"George of Bastrop, TX",7/31/2015,,"I called the Comcast Xfinity hotline to get internet only (no TV, no home phone). There was no option to set it up online. The rep put me on hold for about 10 min to ""put some packages together."" Then she claimed that the best option for me was a promotional package 75mb/sec for $39.99 plus monthly $10 for modem rental. I explained that I already had a modem that I would want to use. I told her that this was quite expensive and asked if she had something cheaper. She replied that the only other ""package"" she had was for $29.99 for 6mb/sec. All in all she was a bit snotty during our conversation and was quick to hang up after I said I want to explore other providers."
"Bernadine of Miami, FL",7/31/2015,,My husband and I have had Comcast for 6 months now and right from the beginning the customer experience was horrible. 3 times the men that were supposed to come to set up our cable came the day before they were supposed to and got mad at us because we wouldn't let them in since we had to leave to work and it wasn't the date we had given for them to come. 2 times we were hung up on by the customer support staff and we would have to make at least 5 calls at a time to find a person that would be able to help us with our issues. Now for the last 6 months our bill has been gradually going up and we can't understand why. Every other month we either have a credit or money added to the bill and we don't understand where this is coming from. We barely use the phone service and have gotten charged more than the supposed 10 dollar fee that's usually charged. It's a pretty bad situation. The only good thing about them is the Internet and that's it.
"David of Odessa, TX",7/31/2015,,First off trying to use their automated phone system to try to talk to someone is just messed up. It hung up on me over 8 times before I could finally talk to someone. Then when you talk to someone they are real idiots as other reviews say. Then after talking to them I had to call someone else because they would not transfer me and that automated system is just as bad. Then I get another idiot that can't help me that I have to give them my information so someone can call me back in 12 to 24 hours. This whole process took over an hour just to find out someone will call me back in 12 to 24 hours. Really I am trying to get something tooken care of today not 24 HOURS FROM NOW. DO NOT GET SERVICE WITH THIS COMPANY.
"Jack of Elizabethtown, KY",7/31/2015,,"Total Lies and Deceit with their Agents Representations: I had huge problems with service throughout 2014 - and finally, Comcast offered a discount in my monthly payment to make up for technicians not showing up and most importantly, poor quality service. That said, in Jan/Feb 2015 I called Comcast to see if I could lock in my rate for 2 yrs. After speaking to three different agents over a period of four days, I finally agreed to another package that would lock in my rate for $150-$155 per month (First Lie). I deployed in late Feb as a contractor to AFG and after reviewing my bill in Apr 15, allowing for the prorated period to end, I noticed that my billing had now increased to $188.00! Obviously, I was tempted to cancel everything, however, in wanting to take care of my wife while deployed, I decided to keep all and contact Comcast again to figure out a solution.After speaking to two Agents and two days of phone calls, I was told that my package was the best they could do (Second Lie), though I was offered a slight discount that would now bring my bill to $170.00 per month. After agreeing to all and contemplating the deal over the few days, I finally called Comcast again to speak to a Supervisor. Well, I ended up speaking to a Great Agent overseas who told me that I could have been locked in with my old package for 2 yrs, and he would take care of everything. He did, and my new bill should be around $125.00 per month.After that call, I contacted Comcast again, this time, writing into Tom K's office - What a Joke!!! My intent was to see if I could be reimbursed the difference, based on the lies, and now knowing I could have kept my original package. As all of you know, Mr. Tom K. never reads our complaints and sure enough, I received another CS Agent after complaining about my experience, and then wanting to compliment the young man who finally took care with me. Standard verbiage and apologies, without any resolve. They told me they would contact me again and see if they could help. Nothing! I replied again to their CS email and now receiving another CS Agent - Office to Tom K - told me that my case would have to escalated! Still waiting... Upon my return home, I am cutting the Cable!!! Stay away from Comcast. Really, truly the worst CS Ever!"
"Rene of Clarkston, MI",3/1/2016,,"After I sold my house, I paid all final charges from Comcast. A few weeks later a sleazy salesperson called and convinced me that I should only put my account on hold until I moved into my new house which was then under construction. Trusting him, I agreed, and paid a few months charges of $14/mo for nothing at all, and then started getting invoices for over $200 per month. Starting in 8/15, I have had at least 8 phone sessions (very lengthy) and 6 office visits to get resolved their billing me for no service whatsoever. When I moved into my new house in Sept, it took me until Dec to get them to start new service and now they say I owe them for a  of over $100.00. I was courteous today, but agent could not find the source of the charges and ended up just cutting me off. Beware of sales calls from Comcast."
"Vincent of Coconut Creek, FL",3/1/2016,,"I tried to upgrade my internet service but found out that I was only allowed to get the higher speed internet that Comcast offers if I upgrade and bundle services that I didnt need the Comcast TV service, but it seems that if I dont get a bundle package. This is a discriminatory move that should not be allowed. If the higher speed is not available then that is one thing, but I should not be FORCED to spend money on a product that I don't want nor need in order to get one that I do. The account is under Ashley ** my fiance. Any help getting this resolved would be greatly appreciated."
"Sandra of Cambridge, MD",3/2/2016,,Had no phone or internet service for 4 days. Comcast gave me 4 appointments. Either no tech showed and I was told 2 of my appointment was scheduled unsuccessfully. Comcast reps scheduled the appt therefore itt have service. They only credited me 50.00. I was told earlier in the week it would be 20 for each missed appt.Comcast is full of **!!! I missed out on hundreds of dollars in wages and they wouldnt put all the appts in the system. I asked them arent have access to the recordings. Wow!!!
"ernest of Drexel Hill, PA",3/2/2016,,"I signed up last August for the triple deal and was given over the phone a great price so I switched from Verizon. Big mistake. Not only did it take them 5 times to get it working, they have been back almost every month for something. Do you have the time to be home for them to fix it and not to mention the hours on the phone. I have not paid the same bill twice. It always going up and when I called now they say I have a two year agreement not 12 months. I talked to a guy Michael to account and he had such an attitude. Like what your problem?"
"Dina of Ashland, VA",3/2/2016,,"Itt had to call recently. However when we do, I have to have my husband call because his name is on the bill. BUT I PAY THE BILLS! So its usually out longer than Verizon land-line phone service ever is. The cost of cable TV is ridiculously high. The business model is totally for these companies & the networks and not for consumers at all. Networks get paid by advertisers then by cable companies. The cable companies get paid to provide us with the networks. And what does the consumer get? Gouged by cable and advertised to death by the networks. If the networks werent have to also see advertising on that network. In other words, It have any right to not be solicited? Also, all tv should be HD w/o added costs and no commercials should be included when watching shows on demand. "
"Deborah of Portland, OR",3/2/2016,,Pathetic. They dont have it. A lot of channels used to be included in a package but it seems now that all those channels want individual subscriptions. Itt work in this area. The internet is slower than time even though we pay top dollar for the top tier. It also just freezes up often throughout the day. Movies stop throughout their viewing saying not enough bandwidth is available. I think Xfinity purposely clamps down on speed and bandwidth. We dons really unfair. We are in no way hogging the net. Waiting for something better to be available in our area. Reliable? HA! RiDICKulous is more like it. Xfinity is a scam operation and the feds do nothing about it. Criminals.
"H. of Elk Grove, Ca, CA",3/2/2016,,"It usually takes a very long time to get someone on the phone & when we do get someone...they dont understand the problem. The problem is usually not resolved until a day or two later after the ""cable box"" or ""internet modem"" has been ""reset"" several times after several calls back. T.V. is usually fine. Internet speeds are variable and often very slow. Also, the cable provider opted us ""in"" to providing a free hotspot for the general public (at least for other XFINITY subscribers). That made our internet crawl! The installation process was very easy for cable. We tried to also have the phone installed, but it was too difficult so we had to stop that subscription. The internet was a self-setup. Each of our services goes down without warning at various times during the day in all kinds of weather. We're never given an explanation or a credit, even though it happens all the time. "
"Denise of Chgo, IL",3/2/2016,,"They present well but deliver poorly. My DVR died. Called support, determined a replacement was needed, and it was to be mailed to me. Received replacement, replacement did not work. Called again, they told me they would send a repairman out & would CHARGE ME! I cancelled service. Had to return equipment to a local store of theirs. Waited in their store with over 200 people & 1 service person working behind thick plexiglass. One person working!! Waited close to 2 hrs before my number was called. Poor. The costs are too high, their equipment is old, software interface is poor. Service (getting a picture/programs) was reliable, the equipment was not. Quit taking advantage of your subscribers by delivering outdated software, hardware, poor customer service and equipment."
"Karen of Aiken, SC",3/2/2016,,"For 10 years I have paid bills online. Now I am locked out of my account and the Comcast/XFINITY office and customer support is also locked out. And why? Because I do not use the assigned email address for comcast.net. No complaints with the quality of the cable or the internet just the company and their underhanded ways. Every year the cost doubles and you have to go to the retention department to find an affordable ""package"" even if you don't want a ""package"". Few instances of downtime in the 10 or 15 years. To force someone to use another email address is ridiculous, and to refuse online service because a customer does not want yet another email address that terminates with the cable service is unethical."
"Donn of Sugar Land, TX",3/2/2016,,"Deceptive, bait and switch... always want an add-on. I only want internet and basic cable. Usually good reception, but get unexpected downtime on internet at strange hours. Far overpriced for the internet services. For shows, when you are retired, you only watch news. Do not like to pay for all the other garbage channels even on basic. Get better reception on digital antenna for local news. At least, it does not fade out when it rains. They force you to rent their boxes monthly for reception in other rooms. This adds up on the bill. The average retired household only watches one or two news channels, Fox and local news. Women will like the Hallmark channel."
"Donwana of Franklin, TN",3/2/2016,,"Endless hold time, outright lying - it's never their problem. If you want a case study of what NOT to do, look at Xfinity. But since they bought up all the other providers, they have a legal monopoly - would LOVE to cut their cord but need internet access. They hold you over a barrel, insanely high fees, endless surcharges, bad service. They regularly throttle down the service, then deny it. I have the logs from my benchmarking - at least 4 times a week they throttle back. Piss poor. They rape the user. Down at least 3 times a week - then they deny it. Wish to hell Cox operated here."
"Jonathan of Seattle, WA",3/2/2016,,"In a word, lousy. Even when we signed up, they would not give us the cable box we ordered (with dvr) and told us it was their policy to just give what is on hand. The services offered, I dont served by a monopoly."
"Debra of Harrisburg, PA",3/2/2016,,"No cost effective options to lower cable prices, less channels. Who really watches the golf station?? Cantt speak Spanish, I dont I choose my own stations that actually suit my household? Why can't I drop my landline to save money??"
"Art W. of Scranton, PA",3/2/2016,,"For answers, they read off of a computer screen and have no idea what they are saying. X1 box is very slow. Cable and internet is way too expensive for what they provide. DVR doesnt delete programs. I hate Comcast, Xfinity, whatever they call themselves. Rates are constantly going up for no reason, programming sucks, DVR should be a lot faster than it is. Even Comcast says that it is VERY slow!!!"
"Ken of Plymouth, MN",3/2/2016,,Xfinitys system records a couple of minutes beyond the scheduled end of a program thus not risking the loss of the end of the program content. It list the guests on a talk show. You have to take extra steps to find it if it exists.
"Rick of Miami, FL",3/3/2016,,"My Internet has been and still is down since 2/17/16. Every day I call to check and I get the same message, ""Your internet is suffering a problem and it should be ready by"" and then depending on the time of day you will get a 2:30 pm, 7:10 pm or a 10:20 pm. Obviously none occur. On top of all that luckily I finally was able to get a hold of an agent who told me to call the billing department and ask for a credit, If I hadnt have received anything and even now I was credited till the first time I was able to speak to an agent which was 2/29/16. Since we are still with the same problem we have to call every day, go through the trials of automated answering to try to reach an agent (this is very time consuming) to get a credit."
"Kathleen of Seattle, WA",3/3/2016,,We met a Comcast representative at a trade show and agreed to meet with him in the afternoon the next day. He was a no show but did call at 5:30 to say that he was unable to make the tentative appointment. Two days later I received a message from Comcast confirming an appointment for the next day. I did not make the appointment so extended to them the courtesy of canceling in. I was placed on hold twice. Spoke to two representatives and explained that I had not made the appointment I was cancelling. Both made me verify my credentials two different ways and asked me to explain why I was canceling the appointment. At 8:20 pm the same night I received another call verifying my appointment. I think I know why our bills are so high -- too much service.
"Neil of Columbia, MD",3/3/2016,,"After many years with Verizon FIOS, I decided to switch over to Comcast because they honestly did offer me more channels for less money than Verizon did. However, it was a terrible mistake. First (this is not actually a big deal, but it does bother me), for some reason Comcast does not offer the same HD movie channels that Verizon does. For the premium channels, only the main channels are offered in HD. This means that HBO is in HD; however HBO2, HBOW, HBO Family, etc are only in SD. Same goes for Showtime, Starz, and all the premium channels. I talked to Comcast about it and he basically tried convincing me that Verizon does not offer those either. I have already switched back to Verizon and I assure you, all the premium channels are offered in HD.Now for my real complaint: After having Comcast for about 3 months, my internet and cable went down one day. I thought ok, no big deal, this happens sometimes. After a day I gave them a call and they sent a technician to come check it out. The technician says the problem is not in our house and there is an issue with the wiring outside in my neighborhood. He said he was not qualified to fix this so said a technician who deals with those issues will come and fix it in a couple hours. So later in the day, I noticed a Comcast truck doing work on my street and assumed they were trying to fix this problem. However, they left eventually without stopping by to check if it worked. It still did not work and now I had no idea what the plan was to fix this. So I called Comcast back. They were like ""Oh thatt happen with me.Finally I said ok and anticipated her call. Of course, never got contacted again. After 2.5 weeks of no internet, cable, or any inclination of the problem being solved in the future, I canceled my service and switched back to Verizon. I had always heard rumors about how Comcast customer service is horrible but I never imagined it could be as bad as my experience was."
"spanish of Lauderhill, FL",3/3/2016,,I move and transfer service. Instead of moving your service Comcast train their staff to lock you in a new contract without you knowing even if you have service for the last 5 years with them. My bill was 2300 from when I move in December 18 until Feb 1. I receive a bill for 2300 thats a waste and a shame Comcast steal from their customer. What you pay for you never get. Comcast rob me. 
"Penny of Baltimore, MD",3/4/2016,,"I needed to call Comcast to speak with someone about my billing, as my husband's business was paying $70.00 less per month for the exact same services. I used to call Comcast and get whatever help or info I needed... Now it is all menu-driven and I had to look to Google for blogging help as to how to get a human being on the line. It took me 1 1/2 hours to find someone who would adjust the billing... The 1st person took over 10 minutes just to find me the Comcast business phone number I needed (because Comcast residential does not have the contact number for Comcast business?) and then she could not transfer me so I started all over again. Now, after that 1 1/2 hour stint, waiting on hold and speaking to 3 people, I am supposed to receive an email contract in order to lower my bill, but I have not received it. This is nonsense. I will have to go through it again. They have no customer service."
"George of Mechanicsburg, PA",3/5/2016,,"Be prepared for a complicated, detailed and possibly faulty sign-up process. We encountered a rude agent, then failure to get phone number and equipment delivery. Had to go through ""reprocessing."" Hoping try no. 2 works."
"Luther of Adrian, MI",3/5/2016,,"I have only had this service for 6 months and it has been an absolute nightmare since the day I signed up for it. Their customer service is terrible, they bill me for a DVR that I dons how they do business. I am convinced they only want your money as the bill is the only thing that is consistently on time, they never forget to charge you for service you may or may not have. Xfinity sucks my ** and I'm going back to Dish Network."
"Equilla of Detroit, MI",3/5/2016,,"I have been on the phone with customer service for 1 hr & 20 min. I am now waiting for account verification. This company is a disaster! I dont trust them to do what they say they will do) Just as I expected a foreign speaking rep said she could not find the promotional rate so they had to rework and offer to mirror what I had been promised which was not nearly as good as the promotional rate (mind you I spent 45 min with the telemarketer). I think this is a deliberate bait and switch process because it has happened before with other Comcast situations. I have now been waiting for 3rd party verification another 20 min! Of course when I go through the verification process I was not offered the same as customer service promised! They tried to force me into a contract when I was told there would not be a contract. I have been going through this process for 3 hours and I still do not have a confirmed appointment!! This company is HORRIBLE, PAINFUL and FRUSTRATING! HONESTLY I WOULD RATHER FIND A STRAY BULLET THAN DEAL WITH THIS MADNESS. They could care less about customer service! I pray that technology will continue to advance so that Apple and other streaming vehicles develop technology so that companies like Comcast will be forced out of business and we will not have to deal with such a ** performance anymore!"
"Stephanie of Senoia, GA",3/6/2016,,"After contemplating for 2 years to switch to Comcast I finally decided because AT&T Internet was driving me crazy. It was soooooo slow. We couldnt. So I have this big box with cables everywhere hanging on side house. I was ok with that because I had not cancelled my Direct or AT&T yet. He leaves about 5, then my kids go to watch TV and itm told they will expedite this, but no guarantee. Needless to say at this point my rescheduled date is March 15th, so these fools are leaving us without cable until then. After about 2 emails, 3 phone calls later on March 4, a guy shows up at my home, not the idiot that unhooked these cables, but new guy and plugs all cables back in. But after 1 hour on phone with Direct, still NO cable. So I had to schedule Direct to come out on March 11 to reconnect and get me back up and running and hope they dont deserve my rating because theyt get cocky, because really you are a big fat ZERO star in my eye right now. So now to decide to continue to make my switch or not. Very, very dissatisfied customer."
"Tami of Bonita Springs, FL",3/6/2016,,"Unable to obtain any contact either through phone, Facebook, or website to let a customer service rep know that the internet and cable have been out for nearly 13 hours."
"Davina of Indianapolis, IN",3/7/2016,,"I dumped Comcast for AT&T U-verse a few years ago, and they almost lured me back with one of their promotional packages. I signed up online and they gave me the option of a self-install kit, but after I took that option I realized that the cable was going to need some attention and I needed a technician. So I contacted them, they sent me a confirmation e-mail for the installation date, and even gave me a confirmation phone call for the date.The day of the install arrives and I heard nothing from them within an hour of the installation window, so I checked the status of the appointment online - and it said there was no appointment scheduled. I called them and they confirmed the same. Irritated as hell, I told them to just cancel the account; the customer service representative told me ""Itt me!The savings were tempting enough for me to consider giving them another chance, but my previous experience with getting service installed and working should have kept me from considering them on any level ever again. My first round with them included two service calls they didnd cancelled them - because the field techs pinged the cable and decided there was nothing wrong. Twice. Never mind the fact that the issue was a bad modem and that I had no internet or phone service - and was sitting at home waiting for them both times! Stay clear of them, and dond have been stuck with them for 2 years."
"Yaviany of Margate, FL",3/7/2016,,"Comcast has been the worst. Their billing system has tons of errors showing payments are due even after you've made a payment, which resulted in a fiasco of confusion and unnecessary additional payments, stop payments, and issues with customer service. The last customer care rep I spoke with was argumentative, laughed at me when I expressed my frustration and condescending. I wish my community allowed another service provider."
"cheryl of Burleson, TX",3/8/2016,,"Had Comcast out Fri. They rewired the line outside. Monday the line falls down over my driveway, laying on roof garage, and laying across 3-4 lines coming into, and out of my house. I call Comcast, they say they wons tomorrow, and I still haven't heard a word from Comcast."
"Dylan of Westfield , IN",3/9/2016,,After two weeks of having Comcast my services were canceled for no apparent reason. Was without service for two day. I talked to two representatives about why my services were canceled mind my bills were paid and everything. They could not figure out why they were canceled. Got them hooked up again only to be billed two weeks later for $220 for unreturned equipment. Although I still had my equipment because I still had service with them! They said they would refund me the equipment charge and a supervisor would call me within 24 to 48 hours.One week later no phone call and no refund. I call back and they gave the run around again saying they would have to give a ticket number to a supervisor to call me and give me a refund. Still have not heard anything. I have spent almost 3 hours total on the phone trying to figure out where my money is. Do yourself a favor and don't get involved in this mess of a company. I will be canceling as soon as I get my money back.
"K of Berwyn, IL",3/9/2016,,"I got Comcast July 2015, it is now March 2016, the service is being spotty. I had issues with service down and I had techs coming to my house 6 time until now. The latest was on Feb 2016. The service was down a Wednesday morning. I called and they sent a tech on Saturday. He found , but he said that the connection outside my house was loose. The service was up for a couple of hours after the tech was gone but went down abruptly. I called again and they send somebody next Monday. He checked and declared that there was a faulty splitter inside the house. He replaced it, the service came back on, but he said that the wiring was set up wrong with splitters in wrong place and said that the company would redo it BUT with a fee.A week went by with service (wow!!), but next Saturday morning - what a surprise - the service was down again. FYI: By the term SERVICE I mean everything. TV, internet. I called. As usual I went through the trivial, identification, plug, unplug (stuff that I already done), ping, trying to downgrade the importance of the outage. They scheduled a new tech appointment for the coming Monday. Another day off work for me. The tech this time finds that the problem is at the pole outside my house. A box worn out (he showed to me - I could see it almost in pieces) hanging. He said that the pole techs would come and replace it. And they did. I have service since. The same spotty, down at times but it and he told me that he would waive the rest of the fee FOR THIS TIME ONLY. I have the email with the confirmation. I am waiting for the actual bill to see it happening. Stay tuned. The moral of the whole thing is that Comcast customers need to buy protection plan to protect themselves from Comcast. If not they will be charged for Comcast issues. When there is no competition for a business anything can happen. I have never in my life been treated like that from a company. Much more from a huge one like Comcast. In any case this is life. As my ancient ancestor Socrates used to say . Thanks for your attention, be careful who you are dealing with and do not give up. If we all raise our voice these things will not happen."
"Zaymari of Birdinhand, PA",3/10/2016,,"Comcast or Xfinity, whatever its a piece of **! THEY PROMISE THAT after I make a payment of 303.09 they would put cable. Well I made the payment now Im not putting cable!!! Comcast only worries about money and that's it!!! I HATE COMCAST."
"Bill of Hazel Park, MI",3/10/2016,,"Ire wrong, you MUST pay the entire bill."" Even when you threaten to leave their company they still dont even owe. Terrible, terrible customer service. I'd recommend anyone but them."
"Nick of Madison Heights, VA",3/10/2016,,1st - I have had to go through this painful process of resetting my password over 6 times when I have never had to do this more than once on any other website. You have to actually have a chat message to solve the problem. I think something is wrong with their website. 2nd - I have over 4 conversations about getting a refund from Comcast for over 7 months which still has been useless. Almost every time I get a new story. 3rd - Comcast hits me every 6 months with a new internet plan that costs more in which I have to call and have them switch. Please avoid this company. I would give -5 stars if possible.
"Kaylan of Atlanta, GA",3/11/2016,,"I called Feb 21 to get my devices set up. I was told I would have my internet, home security, and cable set up on February 25th. I recurve an email the night of the 21st saying my apt was set for March 14, 2016. That was not discussed over the phone. I call Comcast back and they told me that was the only time frame they had and it was scheduled. I immediately became upset because that was not the appointment I was promised. I was in my new apartment for a week and a day with no cable, no internet, no security. They installed ONLY THE CABLE AND INTERNET the following week. So in still looking for me why security to be installed.They waived the fee for the security, and I was told I would get 10$ off my bill for 12 months. Here it is March 10, 2016 and I still have no security system. I called back a few minutes ago and spoke to 5 different people within a matter of 20 minutes just for them to tell me that I don't even have an installation date in the system. They proceeded to offer me March 25th to get it installed. THAT IS A WHOLE MONTH with no service still. I am livid with Comcast. This is the worst cable company EVER. And I will not be giving them a dime until I get my services installed. Or better yet I may just drop them as a whole and go with another company. This is ridiculous!!!"
"Adam of Boston, MA",3/12/2016,,"When there was an issue with speed (MBPS), Comcast reps told me to buy their router for 10$ a month. That didnt fix the issue, they wouldnt see this in the news quickly, you better gobble it up for your firms. We're in the process of filing promptly to incentive them to stop doing this to their clients, not to exclude antitrust problems."
"L. P. of Portland , OR",3/12/2016,,"So about 6 months ago last summer a door to door salesman for Comcast basically trapped me outside while doing the yard work and convinced me to switch from DirecTV to Comcast just to try it out. He stated that Comcast no longer has any contracts that they use with new service. He also stated that I would get a $250 (of which I only got $100 gift card) and I only had to stay with the company for 3 months to be able to get the gift card. After the three-month period I was supposed to be able to cancel with no extra cost. However I tried Comcast for about 6 months. I went to try and cancel my Comcast today as I wanted to go back to DirecTV because the service I was getting was horrible. When I cancelled I was then told there was going to be $150 cancellation fee for my contract. I informed the lady on the phone that I did not have a contract, however she stated I approved a contract and there was no way to override it. I argued with her and with her supervisor for about an hour. The supervisor stated that if I would have contacted them after I received the email stating that my services were turned on and at the very bottom I guess it said that it was on a term contract. However because I was told by the agent of Comcast that there was no more contracts I didnm trying to do is first he told me to go to the store and return my equipment and see if they would help me get my hundred and $150 removed from my account. Or if that didns not about the money to me. What It right. And I wonder how many other people he lied to to get them to sign up for Comcast. And how many of these people donre under a two-year contract that they have no idea theym guessing it is because it happened to me. It had to happen to someone else from the same guy. I will be going to the store front hopefully next week and I will update you on what happens. I am just so annoyed that an agent of a company can lie to you and not get in trouble for it. The supervisor said I should have read the entire contract before I signed it. Im sure that if they lie the company will fix it. And the service by the way was horrendous. I had probably 20 if not more disruptions in service in the six months that I had it than I did in the 15 years that I had DirecTV before that. Also Comcast charges for most of its on demand products. They either say you can rent them or purchase them. Whereas DirecTV has mostly free on demand. You have to pay for some of their movies but most of their TV shows are free. It know why I even tried it for the three months let alone 6 months that I did. I figure they were a big company and they would be able to fix the problems. Yet they sent out technicians and the problems did not get fixed and now I find out they lied to me. So I will be coming back after I go talk to someone in the store and let you know if I got anything resolved or if I had to write that snail mail letter and then see if someone calls me back. So basically do not under any circumstances sign up for Comcast unless you have a lawyer. Read your contract ahead of time. Or you'll get screwed."
"Leona L of Alexandria, VA",3/13/2016,,"So, as I sit here having to use my Verizon MIFI because COMCAST XFINITY prematurely turned off my services!!! Rewind back a few days ago, 8 March 2016 to be exact, I alerted COMCAST XFINITY of my pending move for 25 March 2016. After about 10 mins of back & forth with the COMCAST XFINITY representative, she finally confirms (confirmation #**) my cancellation of services for 25 March 2016. Fast forward to last night, 12 March 2016, my COMCAST XFINITY services (phone, internet, and cable) are completely OUT. I called the representative and she was totally baffled, asking me if I tried to reset it, how long itt a power outage in the area, it appears thered be able to come is tomorrow afternoon (13 March 2016) between 1 and 4 pm. This morning, 13 March 2016, I received a call at 8:00 am from a COMCAST XFINITY representative asking if my issue had been resolved; I informed her it had not. She acknowledged my answer then reminded me that I had an appointment for TODAY, a technician would be here between 1 and 4 pm. As the clock approached 4 pm, 3:53 pm to be exact, I called COMCAST XFINITY to inquire about the technician. Well, they told me that they DONd have to be the ones that turn on my services. By then, my husband took the phone to find out what has happened. Talk about the ABSOLUTE WORST EVER CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! FYI, the representative during the Chat was Divya, I cannot recall the representatives call or the 8:00 am call; however, the representative we spoke with at 3:55 pm - 4:38 pm was ""Art"" who admitted he was physically in the Philippines, and now we have his supervisor ""Nick"". My husband is now asking for Nick services to be turned on!!! The same services that SHOULD NOT have even been turned off before 25 March 2016! My husband was transferred to the internet side of the house...CLOSED! WTH!!! I WOULD NEVER EVER EVER recommend this piss poor company! COMCAST XFINITY has false advertising AND their customer service is the ABSOLUTE WORSE!!!"
"Andrea of Houston, TX",3/13/2016,,"Houston has 2 internet providers - AT&T and Comcast. Both are horrendous, unreliable, and have terrible customer support. Being forced to choose one over the other makes question if weve wasted sooo much time and money trying to get decent, reliable service that if I was getting paid to wrestle with Comcast, I'd be a millionaire."
"Cassie of Arvada, CO",3/13/2016,,If you have any choice do not use Comcast. The technician who set up our service was not knowledgeable and the company switched our package to a lower one without our knowledge. The service technician also broke our sound bar and Comcast is doing nothing to fix it or replace it. Overall an awful experience and we plan to cancel service asap.
"Brandeeyes of Oakridge, TN",3/15/2016,,"Triple play for 99 is an estimate only. After they add in all their hidden cost my bill is 184 a month. Also a data limit of 300gigs is ridiculous - thatd be moved to unlimited data free of charge and 2 months later a charge of 55 was on my account raising my bill to 240 a month. I recorded all conversations and stored them just for this reason. I contacted customer service 3 times to be clear no extra charge for unlimited data would apply to my bill but did the fact I had 4 of their employees on record saying no charge would be applied, no it did not. Of course all this happened after my 30 days in which I could cancel and go with another company so I'm stuck for a year with an outrageous bill and the worst internet available. I suggest you really do your research and ask over and over what your bill will be after all the fees they continue to pack on after you sign. Not pleased and I will cancel asap."
"Eugene of Portland, OR",3/15/2016,,"I am receiving billing for charges I have already paid. When I go to log in for further information they say that my log in and password are not valid even though I had just established one. This is confusing and raises doubts as to their record keeping. I would choose another server, but I still have time on my contract. So I'm stuck and unable to get answers from XFINITY."
"Luis of Kissimmee, FL",3/15/2016,,"I just recently moved to the place I am now and request Comcast service due to the reason this is the cheaper cable company around here. It was the worst decision ever. The cable is literally a basic local channel antenna with no good channels at all. All the cable channels are blocked, the only channels you can see are the same ones you can see with an antenna, and the WiFi is the worst - the signal doesnm just going to cancel this crap and look for another company."
"kelly of Montgomery, IL",3/15/2016,,"I spoke to a representative with whom was given my contact information. It took her 2 days just to get me a price. When I agreed to the price she said she would call me right back with an installation date. It's 5 days later and no call from her. I was connected with another rep who told me if I paid a $100 deposit on Thursday I would be guaranteed service on Saturday. Since I have 2 children who need internet to do homework I paid the deposit. No call from Comcast by Saturday so I called the rep back, he told me to give him until 11 am that day and he would have a time for me.I called at 11 am, as requested and as of the following Tuesday I still had not heard back from the rep. I had received a call from Comcast that Monday saying someone would be there on Tuesday AM to do install. I had to have someone at my house waiting since I had to work. The tech showed up, stayed about 20 minutes and told the girl waiting that the install could not be done. I then called the rep who guaranteed service by Saturday and he again went back and forth with me, along with his supervisor. I was told by his supervisor that she would call me by 6 pm that same Tuesday and I would have install that night.I never received a call and I had been told they would send me instructions immediately on how to log onto the HotSpot in my area, to which I still have not received information. I went back and forth with several reps with your company and was constantly transferred from person to person, and in many cases right back to the first automated system. It took me until the following Monday to get someone competent on the line who had installation set up for the following day. I was told many times by the 2nd rep who had guaranteed service on that Saturday the because of all the problems I would be credited back the $100 deposit, that the $50 installation fee would be waived and that the $150 installation fee was not going to be due.I still have no credit to my debit card, and I see no installation fees removed from my bill, which was sent to me several days before I even had service. I would not recommend this service to anyone. Worst company I have ever dealt with. There is no excuse for so many incompetent people or being referred back to the beginning of automated system or sent to the wrong department. Not only do I have 2 children who need internet for school work, I run businesses from my home and was forced to use additional data from my cell phone line to make up for Comcast errors."
"Amanda of Grayson, GA",3/16/2016,,"Shory story: Xfinity has horrible customer service, logistics, and they are happy that way. Run or your wallet become the Xfinity ATM; meanwhile you will wonder why your rear hurts. Long story: I should have known Xfinity was a bad idea when they couldnt even part of my package. They charged me for all of it even though I rejected the boxes that werent even look like the one they use. Then, include the random billing. Apparently, if paying through the ""convenient"" app, paying the full amount of the bill isnt add up, but as the customer, you are pretty much ** up as far as they are concerned."
"Benjamin of Boynton Beach, FL",3/17/2016,,"And so it begins... I just moved down here from New York and had to choose a provider. I wanted to go with DIRECTV but of course my building is facing the wrong direction. So between AT&T and Comcast. I read reviews on Comcast service and AT&T internet problems. Choosing between the two is like choosing between a Trump and Hillary election, you are going to be disappointed either way. I choose Comcast. After several visits to the place to get equipment and the runaround to get it set up, my internet struggled to get going. They stated the wires are dead in both outlets and would need to send a tech to look at it (which would cost money). Now how would an apartment complex that is continuously full all of a sudden have outlets that are ""dead""? I said no and that we would need to go ahead with it and they need to fix it on their end cause Ive only had it for 3 and on top of that I was charged a late fee. After several calls... Person 1 says it was a mistake, Person 2 says they do that now, and Person 3 says theym only accountable for the 1 month but I now can see my upcoming bill, then how come I was charged a late fee? They dont so I make a PIN: **. 1 month later the PIN doesnt work. He asks me if I would like the PIN removed? Say what now? This company is the most poorly run company I have ever witnessed. I count the days until I buy my house and can finally get DIRECTV. Stay Away!!!"
"Beth of Aurora, CO",3/17/2016,,"When I signed up for the 2 year contract I was told on the phone that my bill would not change for 2 years. That is a lie. After a year, my bill went up by $20.00. I was told that I was getting a discount for the equipment, but that discount was only for one year, not the two years that I was sold. When I asked the Comcast rep over the phone where that information was in writing, it turns out there is nothing in writing that he could provide to me. I plan to write Comcast and have them tell me that in writing."
"Brad of Hillsborough, NJ",3/19/2016,,"I had a mark-out done for my dog fence. When the contractors were digging they hit my cable line and my internet was down. They immediately told me that they cut it so that is a cut line and no service is proceeded to call Comcast. First question was am I sure that my service is out. The customer service rep completely clueless said someone will come on Wednesday and said, ""I will call you back in a half hour."" Do you really think that happened? So I called back after a hour and a half, ""Someone maybe can come out on Monday."" Then I got a call from support to ask if my internet was working and I asked, ""Did someone fix the cut underground?"" and the rep didn't know what to say and just disconnected the call. That is some awesome service."
"Amy of Chattanooga, TN",3/19/2016,,"Was anyone told that they would have unlimited Internet, but get an email saying ""you will be charged for over usage""?"
"Rodger of Irwin, PA",3/19/2016,,"I was a Comcast customer years ago, and was very dissatisfied so I switched to Dish. A salesman sold me on giving them another try since I was not satisfied with my internet service. He told me that install would be easy and the install tech would do everything. I let the sales rep know that I had two phone lines in my home and they both had to be connected. When the installer came, he said he knew nothing about a second line, and he didnt do that, and He would not do that.After thinking about it for a few minutes, his solution was to drill a hole through both sides of an interior wall and run a feeder line from the second phone line to the modem. UNACCEPTABLE! Im always available"", he said. Three phone calls today, and no answer.Itm ready to quit again. To top it off, 5 minutes after he left, the internet service stopped working. The only bright note of the day was that I called the toll free number and someone got it going remotely. STAY AWAY FROM COMCAST/XFINITY."
"Claudia of Delray Beach, FL",3/19/2016,,"This company changes the channels to get you frustrated so you have to pay for upgrades in the service. They remove your favorite channel and replace it for the worse one possible. Their intention is to force you to get upgrades. This changes happened several times with my service. They recently removed History channel from my service which is one of my family's favorite. We used to watch it together and enjoy fantastic story telling and the great knowledge from instructional programs that it offered. Well they replaced it with ""Vice"". Vice is a channel where all you see is people doing drugs, partying and getting wasted. Unbelievable! I wonder what kind of people can take decisions like this and live happy with themselves."
"Nicole of Seaford, DE",3/19/2016,,"My experience with Comcast was like something out of a horror movie. First they was late, real late, then they left without hooking up all my services, then I call back only to hear them tell me a technician would be back until the next day. I don't recommend this company."
"Alex of Mibile, AL",3/21/2016,,"If you want a home Internet service, please do not pick Comcast for service. Why, they are a liar and cheat! I signed up home Internet from Comcast. They said there was $29.99 plus $10.00 for modem and its unlimited internet. Guess what, it cost me $134.99 month. Please be my advice, do not get hook Internet with Comcast, be smart ok."
"sam of Cheshire, CT",3/21/2016,,"Called Comcast Friday, February 18, 2016 at 5:00. Was on the phone with them for about 55 minutes telling the customer service rep that I wanted to cancel my basic cable service. He made an attempt to try to get me to bundle my internet and cable telling me it would be cheaper. It told him I dont want this cancellation on his name so he hung up on me."
"Polo of Cordova, TN",3/21/2016,,On today a tech came out which from the jump I could tell was a rookie... He states my apartment needs rewiring and I cant answer nor return my calls... so now I have no cable nor can I watch Netflix... I hate a theft!!!
"Eszter of Washington, DC",3/22/2016,,"I have been a subscriber to your internet services since Feb 15, 2016. I contacted to you add a digital TV service on March 3, asking for a package that includes news channels. Round 1: The agent over the phone assured me that the proposed package would include news channels. He informed me that I would have the service in 72 hours, with the set-top box delivered.Round 2: I called again after 5 days (March 7) and nothing happening, to find out that my order got lost. After a very long phone call I agreed with another agent that I order the package the price of which went up (from 64 to 69 dollars). I had to wait 72 hours and the service would work. Later I received two obsolete set-top boxes (I asked for one box, presuming all boxes are HDMI-enabled). When I put the system together, I found no news channels.Round 3: I chatted online. In the end I was reassured in writing by Juvy Lyn ** Comcast customer care specialist on March 9 that the Preferred Double Play with Blast 150 Mbps speed for $89.99/month for 12 months promotion has been successfully added on my account. Notice the price hike. I sent back the two obsolete set-top boxes.Round 4: I did not receive anything in 5 days. I called and a very helpful agent named Chris informed me that the sending of the HD set-top box was put on hold and my order to change the service to include news channels was lost. He proceeded to clean up the mess for me. After a phone call that lasted about an hour, he subscribed me to Starter Double Play (price hiked to 98 dollars) and set the HD set-top box on route. I was expected to get the service working by March 21.Round 5: On March 21, after setup, my TV displayed only that this set-top box is no longer active. I chatted online with an agent who solved the problem, but with the picture, two other problems surfaced: no sound whatsoever and the news channels missing. These channels are missing even though the previous day I had received email confirmation that I was now a subscriber to the Starter Double Play package, which includes Digital Starter, a compilation with news channels.Round 6: Today upon turning on the TV all I could see was the â€œThis set-top box is no longer active.â€ message, despite yesterdayâ€™s troubleshooting. I have lost my patience with you. This should be a simple business: I order the service, you deliver, I pay for it. As things stand, I order the service, you donâ€™t deliver, I pay more and more for it. At each contact with you, I had to explain all my Comcast issues from the start. Each phone call and chat lasted at least half an hour.At each conversation, I ask you to correct the misspelling of my first name. Each time you promise. It is still misspelled. Under normal circumstances, I would have quit Comcast already. As you have monopoly in my building, I cannot do it. But I expect some sort of a compensation for this lack of professionalism, the wasted hours over the phone and chatting, and the distress it caused. The least you can do is to send a professional to my home and have the system set up perfectly and without any further cost to me. I am looking forward to your reply. My next step is filing a complaint with the US customer protection body."
"Jeremy of Naples, FL",3/23/2016,,"I signed up for xfinity Internet. They charged me for modem rental fees since day one when I clearly told them I donm sorry, will change the billing and refund you"" and I always say ""thank you"" but Ill have more problems. I called them to not renew my internet after the year and told them I dont worry yous now on my credit report. Bunch of bs. I don't know any other businesses that can get away with ** like these guys do. How can I get this off my credit report?"
"L. R. of Wilmington, DE",3/23/2016,,"I made a call to Comcast because of a payment I made that it was wrong due to us writing one amount on the check and actually wrote on the writing part of the check the right amount then Comcast go by the amount that we wrote not the other amount. Our bank said to call Comcast and they may fix the problem, but from the moment I called to fix the problem with Comcast the cust serv was unprofessional and rude. They said nothing they can do that we would have to pay the difference and if I put a stop on the check I would get a fee of $25 and thatm not satisfied. I wished there were other cable company I can transfer to but on my area Comcast are the only one. This rude unprofessional Customer Service Gerry kept reminding we have been on the phone 45 min or 1 hr. ""This would only would have taken 30 min to me"". He sound it angry the entire conversation and just wanted to end up conversation even though we talked about other ways to save money, but in the long run Im not happy with this particular customer service by the name of Gerry and I didnt like but that would be my second option."
"Rebecca of Chicago, IL",3/23/2016,,Customer service is terrible! I shouldnt have done this on my own. It recommend Comcast to anyone just because of customer service or lack thereof.
"Kelly of Ponte Vedra Beach, FL",3/23/2016,,"I wish I did not sign a 2-year contract with this company. I do not know how they stay in business besides lack of competition. I waited over an hour to speak to a representative. Could not get them to send me my bill for 6 months after calling repeatedly. They raised the price after a couple months because the promotional price ends, which I was never informed of. I got quoted a priced and after I complained about my bill being much higher I was informed it was because that was an estimate. I should have read the fine print. Make sure you read every single detail of any contract they try to lock you into. They also charged me 15$ for HBO after I was given it free and asked for it to be removed. Check your bill over and over. If government cable regulations change and a company has to charge you more, I would expect a notification. Of course that thought did not occur with this company. Please do some research before choosing Comcast."
"David of Saint Johns, FL",3/23/2016,,"Cable Removal for Construction -- Mr. Tom Karinshak my name is David ** and I'm in Jacksonville Florida. I have been trying for three weeks. Do you have someone in the residential service to disconnect your cable line from an electrical in order for me to have the electrical remove the pole in order for me to build a new home. The first day I called which one is three weeks ago. A gentleman by the name of Pete came out looked at it and said it had to go to another department and they will be in touch with me within 24 hours. That never happened. I called again and spoke with these people in one phone call, Jasman, Shanail, Julie. I was told it had to go to residential services and that someone would call me on Saturday morning March 19. Guess what? That never happened either. I called on Monday the 21st and no returned my call then. On the 22nd I spoke with James and then a young lady by the name of Janet. She told me that the job was set up on them to take the line down 3-28-2016. I let her know that would not work. I need to demo the house. I asked for her supervisor. When I did that she found this funny and chuckled on the phone, said ""hold on a minute."" After waiting another five minutes to get back on the phone and said he was not available and he will call me back within two hours. It was 2:30 Eastern time. She said his name was German **. Guess what? It is now 7:30 Eastern time and I have yet to receive his phone call. And need someone that has another authority do you contact me to remove your wire this week. I have never been forced to work with any company as incompetent as Comcast. The first work order I was given was **. Nobody with your organization can tell me what happened with that. The new work order number is **. I need someone to respond with a reasonable date to come and take your line down. My contact information is David ** or I can be reached by email at **. Now I have spent close to 7 hours between phone calls and now I have spare close to 7 hours between phone calls and this letter. Not to count the 45 minute drive to meet Pete the first day then a 45 minute drive back to my office. If you have anybody in your organization that is competent enough to do that I would appreciate them contacting me."
"jeff of Meriden, CT",3/24/2016,,"I have never had bad Internet and have been Cox, Metrocast, Frontier and never have had this many problems with the Internet. I use Skype a lot and always losing connection. With the others I could stay on Skype 24/7 and never had connection issues. Since Comcast I am lucky sometimes to have a connection for 10 minutes. It's the worst Internet I have ever had."
"Viedettanne of Coatesville, PA",3/24/2016,,"C.S. called with an offer regarding triple play, sounded good so I went for it. Was not told correct amount so I cancelled & now I have to pay the bill that is 1/2 of my monthly check or have service terminated."
"Charles of Jacksonville, FL",3/24/2016,,"I have only lived in Florida for 7 months and we wanted U-verse as that was by far the best in St. Louis! I have heard nothing but horror stories about U-verse down in Florida. Well I have to say that Comcast is not the worst, but I donre talking once every 4-5 months! Also itm doing is going back to AT&T U-verse for a better viewing experience w/better channels too!"
"Naveen of Fremont, CA",3/24/2016,,"Hi All, Comcast Xfinity... Big fat liars. Comcast charged me $10.00 every month for the equipment they have not provided. When I realized that they over charging me every month, I reached out to Comcast. They said they are sorry and said they will refund me money back in 4 to 6 weeks. After 6 weeks they call me and says I owe them 30 plus dollars. Now I am chatting with them and they say they charged me for the equipment. I was given only setup TV box. They were also charging me for Modem which they never provided me."
"Abigail of Windsor, CA",3/24/2016,,I had their service for many frustrating years. My last experience with them is that three months ago I moved to another state and turned my equipment in. They never turned the service off and want 590.00 for the last three months after I closed the account and sold my house. I talked to their customer service person whose voice was almost not audible in Panama. He said he would take care of it but again I got another bill asking me to pay for someone else's bill! Frustrating to deal with them.
"Zac of Murfreesboro, TN",3/25/2016,,"Ok, this is going to be rather long since I have spent roughly 14 total hours on the phone over the past couple weeks dealing with Comcast agent after Comcast Agent to Supervisors, Managers, and as of today Executive Customer Service Members. Comcast is by far the worst company I have ever had the unfortunate displeasure dealing with. The lack of respect, the extreme rudeness, and the way they lie right through their teeth is ridiculous. I mean is Comcast post jobs that require past experience as Lawyers? Let me break down my experience for you all. I also recorded all the calls that I had with them and once I get them compiled I will be posting that somewhere as well. If anyone has a good venue to post those calls that will be more effective against Comcast please share your thoughts and opinions on the matter.So here it goes. I have used Comcast for a while now, purely for Internet Service. I then received a Promotional Flyer for the ""2 Year Fixed Rate Agreement"" for Comcast Blast Internet (Which I currently had) and Comcast TV and X1 DVR. The promotion 2 year fixed rate terms according to the flyer was that for $99/mo, I would receive Blast Internet, TV with the X1 DVR included... I talked it over with my wife (same day as the promotion came to the house) and since we were already paying $79/mo just for the Blast Internet alone, we decided that it would be nice to have the DVR and watch some TV every now and then...I called the number on the flyer and told them that I had the promotion that I was holding in my hand, and they said yes absolutely and I agreed to the terms and all was good. A week later my DVR and TV just go black and I call Comcast to fix the issue. They said that I do not have TV service and that the DVR is not included in the promotion and that the particular promotion I was talking about was no longer being offered. I told the lady that I had already agreed to the terms last week when they came out to do the install and she disregarded what I said completely and told me that if I wanted to have the DVR service that I would have to go through the agreement which was now listed at $109/mo and that she would send out a technician to do the installation.I had to explain to her once again that we already have the X1 DVR installed in our house, and that the reason I was calling was to have someone fix it because the picture would not show up and the sound would spit out intermittently. This conversation went back and forth for about 3 hours, and finally I had enough and said fine I would agree to the 2 year fixed rate of $109/mo. The lady said she would have a technician out there between a 4 hour window tomorrow morning... Tomorrow morning came then afternoon... I called Comcast once again and spent another 3 hours on the phone with them because they would not listen to what I was telling them.I told this lady that I was expecting a technician to come out because the picture on my DVR was out and it was spitting out sound randomly, and that I have already gone through this process of trying to send refresh signals to the box, and that it is not the issue and does not resolve anything, which is why the technician was scheduled to come out in the first place. So she decided to ignore what I said, and started sending refresh signals and I told her another time that will not do any good and that the only thing I need is the actual technician to come out and look at the box itself.I am an IT person and I have a decent understanding of the differences between Software and Hardware issues, and this particular issue is not something that can be handled remotely. She put me on hold while she read her report that she got back from the signal refresh, and to her complete surprise it seemed (and now 3 hours into the call) she said ""I think that there might be something with the X1 DVR box itself because the refresh signals are not working..."" I was completely blown away... I had repeatedly told her exactly what was going on for the last 3 hours but anyways, she said that she would schedule a technician to come out and I got the confirmation number and waited the next day for the technician to come out... no show.I called Comcast yet again, and they told me that they had cancelled the technician appointment because one of the agents in the middle of night, reviewed my account, and sent a refresh signal and it said that everything was working, so they cancelled the appointment... I was furious but stayed professional and had to go through yet another round of whatt, plus they were charging me the standard rate of service for both Internet and TV. According to the bill, there was not a promotion rate or agreement applied to my account. Needless to say I was really fed up, and then spent 6 hours on the phone bouncing from one agent to the other, getting bumped to hold, then handed off to another agent and finally got a supervisor.I explained everything to her and she actually was apologetic and said she would take care of it, and said that my total fixed monthly rate for the 2 year agreement would be $133.20 and it would not be changed. So at this point I was somewhat ok, and checked my account again and it says I had past dues still on the account for a technician and a month of service. I have called many times within the last 2 months to clear this up, and finally got to the point where I just told them flat out that I will pay what I owe, which is the amount that I agreed to of $133.20. I will not pay a single penny more. The issue was then escalated to the ""Executive Branch of Customer Service"" which is an even bigger joke..Now we are at present date, I spoke with Eric **, Executive Customer Relations of Comcast Corporate. I told him what had happened and his response to me was that I do owe what they are saying and that the fixed rate agreement isnt wait because we can finally be free of Comcast/Direct TV/ and Dish which one is no better than the other. They are all terrible. If you by chance want to reach out to Eric ** at Comcast Executive Customer Relations his number is **."
"russ of Suwanee, GA",3/25/2016,,"To say that I despise Comcast would be the biggest understatement I have ever made. This company who I actually liked at one time have been so completely worthless over the last 8 months yes 8 months trying to resolve multiple billing errors it is beyond belief and I will never give them a penny as long as I live. I ended my service last Aug. yet they continued to bill me thru Oct which I finally cut them off and blocked my credit card as well as reversed the charges. I made my first call about this error the first day I got the bill in Sept. 12 calls and 8 months later still no resolution. And get this they have now sent me to collections and it is showing up on my credit report. Each time on the call they begged forgiveness and promised that they would 100% take care of this. I have been promised this by a few of the following:Lucky 10-6-15. Zee 12-29-15. Karen 12-29-15 and she even gave me a confirmation # of ** that we were done. Ashley 12-30-16 finally I think it is done. Nope I then got my next collection notice on 1/20/16 but I am in Europe so I canâ€™t respond. Next I got to talk to 2-8-16 Jasmine. 2-8-16 Christine. 2-8-16 Joy who promised that Comcast would in fact call me back by end of business, of course that never happened. I just got back from a love trip to Europe and Asia and what do I find in my mailbox, another collection notice. So today 3-25-16 I talk to Pamala who transfers me to a supervisor Aaron. He informs me that they had made huge errors and they he will finally take care of it all. And oh by the way they still want me to pay $60.62 that they say should have been the final bill. So I asked him what the probably 20 hours of time I have spent on the phone is worth and he said ""that is unfortunate but you had service and you owe Comcast."" No apology just you owe Comcast. Then I asked about the credit reporting and he said that is automatic. We will see if anything actually happens. All I can say is that this company took a loyal customer and turned me into a zealot to tell every single person who will listen to never do business with them ever again. The fact that I am taking the time from my very busy day to write this would give you a clue how bad this entire mess has been. All I can say is NEVER EVER consider COMCAST for your cable. I got DirecTV at one of my houses and AT&T at the other and so far all is well."
"Austen of Kissimmee, FL",3/25/2016,,"Worst ISP available. Intermittent signals with the absolute worst telephone service I have personally ever experienced. When I say intermittent signal, my internet will randomly go out. The best part is, however, I can yell into the ""security camera"" aimed inside my house to turn the signal back on, and it works! Big brother? Is that you?"
"Chris of Orinda, CA",3/26/2016,,"Just terrible. Super expensive and the worst service ever. I pay for 72 mbps and I get 28. I call for tech support and they say, ""sure we can send someone out to help."" He gets here, and cant get 72 mbps. Cancelling and NEVER COMING BACK... EVER!"
"David of St Clair Shores, MI",3/26/2016,,"I just switched to Xfinity from U-verse. The DVR from Xfinity is in one word ""terrible"" as compared to the DVR from U-verse. The issues that I have discovered about the DVR is: when you record a 30-minute program, it only records 29 minutes. If you record a program that is 60 minutes long it only records 59 minutes. You must go and add in 1 or 5 minutes to record the tail end of a program. U-verse automatically adds on 2 minutes. There is no ""STOP"" button on the remote just a pause/play button. If you are watching a recorded program and you decide to stop and delete it you have to pause it, go back to the Xfinity button, go to saved programs, select the program highlight, and delete it. Then you have to permanently delete it. Too many steps. U-verse has a stop button and you can delete it immediately. Another issue I have is that there is no list of programs (series) that you can review from time to time to see if you dont honor their year contract policy. My policy year ends in February and by December they had started to raise my rate. Raised it again in January. I kept my end of the deal, but they don't!"
"olga of Miami, FL",3/26/2016,,"With Xfinity I experience constant outages that their Department cannot fix. They send supervisors over and still no results. Xfinity is terrible. They do not have control of their area and they continue to have outages in Kendall and Is over, It even watch TV. I do not recommend Xfinity. It's horrible."
"S of Lacey, WA",3/27/2016,,"I usually comment on how much I hate Comcast customer service but today it is their ethics. My husband tried a speed test through Comcast -- 80 bits or whatever when on the phone with them -- because our internet wasn't working. Through a non-Comcast site? 20. How can they live with themselves? Freaking liars. Our bill has gone up $20/year consistently over the last three years for the same service. It is just so wrong. However, they are the only high speed internet provider in the area. Monopoly, anyone?"
"Marcelle of Petaluma, CA",3/27/2016,,I have been without a WIFI connection for more than one month now. If I want to use my iPad at night in my bedroom - I have no connection. My old modem that I rented from Comcast functioned perfectly well until Comcast switched to an updated modem in February (2016). I spoke to numerous Comcast employees and they came to my home without fixing anything. I think they lowered my Internet speed and did not tell me. I think Comcast is scamming customers. I have been with them for more than ten years now - always paid on time. (180 per month). I will contact the appropriate branch of government to help me and all others with complaints. I will be 81 in a couple weeks. I have been on the Internet since the early 90's. Have several websites and I need to work on a computer in any room of my home. This is unacceptable. My speed is worse than the 90s when I paid $15.00 a month. Please do something. Many other complaints online.
"Marniqua of Chattanooga, TN",3/27/2016,,"I have had Comcast for 3 years and somehow I got signed into a 2 year agreement when I was told it would be 1 year. Ever since I have added internet and phone, this bill has been out of control. Not to mention that they bill you a month in advance for services you havent get any help on why there is an additional $142.00 on my bill monthly nor can I get help lowering it. Very unhappy."
"Melissa of Crawfordsville, IN",3/27/2016,,"I finally switched to Comcast, actually just because it saved money. Well it was the worst mistake I have even done in my life. They bill you right off so you pay for your services before you get them, which is alright, but what they dont upgrade me with what I ordered of 9.99 because even though I could show confirmation of my order they did not offer that special any more so they ADDED WHAT THEY WANTED! That is not all... I contacted them repeatedly trying to get someone to listen to me and take those charges off. Well they wont and didnt all this time. Well guess what! For another 19.95 a month and 19.95 for shipping they will send me one. WTH! I will add -- the internet sucks worse than low signal wifi! I have super speed. Pay extra now lol. Trust me you do not want to deal with this crap, so run as fast as you can to AT&T! That is where I am headed back to:) Do not order Comcast and think you will have customer service because the joke it on you!"
"Ivan of Nashville, TN",3/27/2016,,My On Demand hasnt fixed and every attempt to talk to someone loops me in endless explanations of my problem to wrong departments or leads to disconnected chats.
"Edward of West Jordan, UT",3/28/2016,,"I am so unhappy with Comcast service, because my statement screw up, it not the same they promises before I took Comcast. The other thing my bill due date yesterday March 27, and I made a payment March 28, but the service already block it. What is the meaning that, or your company getting poor so you can't pay your employ, without rip off customer money. This is make me really upset. I need your response about this situation or I can sent this information to BBB. Thanks. "
"Kate of Nashville, TN",3/28/2016,,"After Comcast mistakenly applied my payments to a three year old out of state account, four months later it is still unresolved. Every time I try to resolve with proof of payment from bank I am first routed to a call center in India then routed back to the Nashville region. Then I have to provide several different case #'s which the agent always fails to find until I provide. This company that provides internet service will only accept fax as proof of payment. WTF!!! Who has a fax machine in their home these days!!! AS INI!!!I have even emailed the VP of customer service... Not like he gives a **. No response of course. I just spent 29 minutes on the phone to get a live person. Another five minutes with someone who barely speaks English with a fake English name. Do you think this is by design? Yes of course it is!!! I am setting up a class action lawsuit with my attorneys because to add insult to injury this has impacted my credit for them losing my payments. If anyone else wishes to participate I can be reached. #xfinitysucks #helloAT&T"
"kristine of Waterbury, CT",3/28/2016,,"I have had Comcast for nearly 18 years. I traveled out of the country to care for an ill family member and missed my payment. Comcast disconnected my service, which was fine. Then, they sent me to collections. They failed to sent me any bills or notifications. Of course, they locked me out of the electronic account so I had no way to even know what was owed or make online payment. Crappy customer service that fails to even communicate with you to give you an opportunity to pay what you owe. Just automatically send to collections, even after they failed to communicate with you when they said they would. Wons owed."
"april of Toms River, NJ",3/28/2016,,"I WOULD HAVE GIVEN NO STAR IF THAT WAS AN OPTION. 9 month billing error and no one can fix it. Pay on time the correct amount and on time EVERY month BUT they turned off my service twice over the discrepancy. I pay the fee to get it turned back on twice and they say they will look into it and they DONt call back. I have had it with companies treating people like this. We pay for a service and get nothing but aggravated. Use someone else, spare yourself from dealing with Comcast."
"brian of Savannah, GA",3/29/2016,,"This is an example of how Comcast have left their installation at **, Savannah. Open to the weather and to any passing trouble maker. Total disgrace. Several attempts have been made for Comcast to fix this but no reaction. A poor statement of quality and will no doubt lead to service issues for the many customers. See pictures."
"Cheryl of Utica, IL",3/29/2016,,We (my husband and I) are trying to disconnect our mothertransferreds nursing home does not receive cable from Comcast (they do not have service in the area). This did not matter. Lesson learned: Comcast is horrible to deal with! Just try and get a loved one's service shut off for a medical reason...
"Erica of Antioch, TN",3/29/2016,,Comcast charged me for service that I wasnt turn me over to collection when they have over billed me. Unlike most of their customers I value my credit. I have called in for help with my bill over 13 times and no one has been able to help me. Someone please help me!!!
"Samantha of Ann Arbor, MI",3/29/2016,,"Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! I have had Comcast for 4 years and I have had nothing but problem after problem. The worst part is they continue to charge me and charge me for sending someone to my house or shipping to send a new box. This is YOUR (Comcast) equipment malfunction, why am I paying for you to fix the issues. I pay for the services. Maybe this is how theyre still in business??? No one is satisfied, maybe they personally make the equipment malfunction so they can charge MORE to have it fixed. When I do have an issue, itforgetforget' to write a comment for the next person to review. Nothing but issues and I have been dissatisfied since day one. I will 100% surely be finding another cable and Internet service provider. My last straw has been pulled! I wish I could rate LESS than one star, because that is what they deserve."
"Carri of New Castle, IN",3/30/2016,,"I had Comcast for over 10 yrs. They kept slowly raising my bill, they would do it $5 at a time so itt. We could not reach a resolution or shall I say they kept giving me the runaround. I dropped them & went to Dish. We had them for over 15 yrs. We then moved from that home and we were approached by a Comcast rep (I have his name, store number and the contract or hand written offer). So the offer was triple play (internet, cable & security) for 24 months for 99.99. I drilled this guy over and over because I knew that was a really good deal. He wrote everything up, assured me & my husband that it was legit and the triple play was for a full 24 months for 99.99. So we agreed to give it a try. So it was installed Feb 2015, installer was very knowledgeable & showed us the equipment, how to use all of it. From that point on it has been downhill. Internet goes out daily, called & they sent out a repair guy. Again very customer friendly worked on the inside & checked the outside. Off he went, he gave me his phone number said to call if problems. He wasnt work then I had to call and they sent a signal to my equipment & they could see I wasns now 124.99. I finally got to a ""supervisor"", spoke to him Gabriel, went through the whole thing again. He told me he couldnt know a promotion but a good paying customer who has never been late or had disconnect notices you cannot help."" He said ""that is right."" Finally after several more minutes on the phone he said they could give me back the 24.99 a month but it would be a lump sum beginning in March and I would have to call back quarterly to get this taken care of. They could not take the 24.99 off a month, so April, May, and June I would pay the 124.99 then would have to call them back and rehash all of this again. Ok so not quite what I hoped for but at least it was something 47 minutes later. So my bill gets credited in March and initially when I checked it 48 hrs later it said negative 80.00. I knew that wasnt pay my bill last month, well I paid $80 of the 180. So on 3/28/16 I called them again, spoke to Larry, he can see that Gabriel had credited then put back on, explained it all again. He tells me that he has to talk with his supervisor Keith that this should have never been done this way and wants to make it right but they will need to review. I said ""pull the phone records you will see exactly what was said."" He said that is what they would do and call me on 3/29/16 after 4pm central time. Here I am 5 hrs later and no call. I would not recommend Comcast to anyone. They do not honor what they sell you, they do not call you back when they say they will, you cans the kicker - if cancel the internet and cable (because It work because it is run off the internet and I still have to pay for the security service that I canm under contract with them, or if I dont exist and then taking advantage of good honest people who work and pay their bills. DO NOT USE COMCAST. THEY ARE A FRAUD!"
"John of Seaford, DE",3/31/2016,,"I really cannot stand this company. Signed a contract in March 2015 for 24 months at 109.00 plus taxes and all the other happy **. Well in March of 2016 they raise my base bill $25.00. Explanation by the rep that is policy after a year. Why did I sign a contract for 2 years for? She didn't want hear it. So I filed a complaint with the FCC. Comcast got back with me, the rep said he will look into it and call me back later in the day. A week passed, I called and left a message, no return call. Finally called again and got the rep on the phone. He said he would lower the bill to what it was. My account online does not match what he said. I tried to call back, left a message and still no return call. Is this a way to run big company? I think not. Comcast needs to change their name to Comcrap."
"S. of Bartlett, IL",3/31/2016,,"I am currently a Comcast customer of 36 years and have an internet and TV only package with no contract. I was endeavoring to reduce my package cost and I planned to have Comcast internet service only and installation of a free HDTV antenna. I initially called Comcast on March 19 to ask for a reduced price for internet service only, which they quoted as $66.95. The service rep. (Brandy) offered me a less expensive Triple Play Package (Internet-TV-Home phone) for $109.99 even though I didnt offered the Double Play for $89.99 as advertised in the flyer, and she agreed to switch me to the new service. However, she couldnt closed out in their system) so she agreed to call me back on Monday, March 28, to verify the transaction. By Wednesday, March 30, I hadnt switch the call to a specific agent. I discussed with him the details of what had previously been agreed to and was informed by him that the offer wasnt put that in the flyer!"" I was then offered the same bundle for $99.99 ($10.00 extra because I speak English!!).This is discriminatory in that the cost of the service varies with ethnicity!!! In fact, this is blatant anti-Americanism for the sake of commercial and financial gain. This is false advertising in that the Xfinity Comcast advertisement flyer is printed completely in English, it contains not one word of Spanish that I could find and must be construed as a bait and switch scam! I.e. a customer is attracted by the offer but is then told it is not available and is vulnerable to being persuaded to purchase another, yet more costly package. Misleading information and contradictory information from representatives of Comcast who seem purposely intent on unscrupulous bait and switch tactics. Once they have discerned that you are persistent in your complaint you are promptly treated as a nuisance.Although I am annoyed at the manner in which Comcast has behaved, I personally retain the ability to negotiate my way through their unscrupulous tactics. My concern is not only for my present negotiations but for those people who may be more gullible or susceptible to these sales ploys. It is a dishonest and devious tactic that places the unaware or uninformed at financial risk through deceptive practices for commercial profit and gain. I am well aware that large corporations like Comcast can easily dismiss the individual complaint and with very little regard to the individual. Yet I am so deeply concerned about these dubious sales tactics on the uninitiated that I feel compelled to bring it to as many people's attention as possible.I am forwarding this letter to persons and parties who may find this of deep concern and act accordingly for the benefit of us all, including: Federal Communications Commission, Better Business Bureau, Comcast Facebook page, Village of Bartlett, IL, Local Housing Associations, Chicago Times, Consumer Affairs, AT&T, and other competitors."
"Eric of Miami, FL",4/2/2016,,I have been experience service outages in my area. The worse thing about the situation is that when you call they tell you everything is working and that the problem is with the connections in your home. After several calls they finally admit that there was an outage. This company's DNA consist mainly of lying to their customer.
"MD of Miami Gardens, FL",4/2/2016,,"I scheduled a service visit because my Comcast internet and phone service is out more than it is working. My house number is clearly displayed and there were two vehicles parked in the front yard. I was waiting and watching for the techniciant help me. There was no supervisor to speak with, no recourse except to reschedule another appointment at my inconvenience! I received a voice message from Comcast stating that because I missed the technician I must reschedule. Customer service from Comcast is non-existent!"
"Niomi of Spanaway, WA",4/3/2016,,"Xfinity tries to deceive you by their commercials that say you can do all this cool crap with their X1, but it freezes CONSTANTLY! Heret come out with a product unless it is able to function properly. I have to unplug the box at least once a day just to get it to half a** work again. We pay $150 a month for cable that barely works! I think this company might actually give me a heart attack because my blood literally boils every time this darn thing acts up!"
"Artist of Decatur, GA",4/3/2016,,"Having only 2 options to choose from in tv and internet service providers is close to a monopoly... Comcast has the worst possible customer service It even interested in meeting minimal customer service... they are just interested in profits! Look carefully at your monthly bills, Comcast sneaks fees and charges, so beware!! What the tv and wireless industries needs are a few companies who care about their reputation as moral, honorable and socially conscious businesses who give a damn. Anyone out there?"
"Marie of Hollywood, FL",4/4/2016,,COMCAST IS CHARGING ME FOR CHANGING PROGRAM WHEN I MOVED ALTHOUGH I ASKED TO REMAIN ON THE SAME PROGRAM AS BEFORE. They told me they would remove that charge and now refuse to do so. They are a very crooked company. They should be put out of business.
"Daniel of Deptford, NJ",4/4/2016,,"Buyer beware, I got new services yesterday and today I get a call about a very old bill and was told if that bills not paid in full my services would be cut and immediately they were. Corporate stated they are powerless against the collection team and can do nothing. Unbelievable. They should be put out of business for that kind of customers treatment."
"Bridget of Montgomery, IL",4/4/2016,,Unfortunately where I live I have Comcast cable â€“ not only is it ridiculously overpriced but the service is terrible. A few weeks ago I started losing all of my HD channels. I contacted Comcast to report the problem and of course the customer service representative could not figure out the problem and said a technician needed to come to my house. I specifically asked if I was going to be charged for this since it was an issue with the cable and was told that as long as the problem was due to the cable and not the wiring in my house there would be no charge â€“ even though they were attempting to have me add some ridiculous protection plan. Technician comes out and has to change the boxes again (second time in less than 2 years) and lo and behold I get my bill which has a charge for the technician. Of course I contact Comcast again only to speak to another customer service representative and a supervisor who cannot help me even though they can see that I didnt be charged but there is nothing they can do about it. The customer service is terrible and apparently no one who works at Comcast is able to provide answers or assistance.
"yvette of Scranton, PA",4/5/2016,,"I am so disgusted with Comcast. You have come to PA, taken over and now have removed channels (yankee) - channel from the guide. Don't understand how you are saying they are charging you so much when you are doing the same to your customers. How sad this is becoming with Comcast doing whatever you want and we are being charged so much for your service. So the channel is charging you for something your customers enjoy and you are doing to us what you say they are trying to do to you. So sad."
"Tyson of Atlanta, GA",4/6/2016,,I recently moved and ordered new service at my new address. Comcast sent a service rep to install my Xfinity box. He arrived within the timeframe that I had set and was extremely helpful in getting me set up. He was even so kind as to put on boot covers as to not track dirt into my house. We got set up and running on his first try and he was out within an hour. I've been using it for a few weeks and have not had any issues. Connection speed has been good and have not had any glitches in service.
"felicia of Indianapolis, IN",4/6/2016,,"I was a new customer to Comcast for their cable services. Will all begin with I moved to a new address and I had a scheduled appointment to have it transferred the next day after I move. Well, while I was at my old address still moving and cleaning items out of my old address, a Comcast technician showed up and I asked the technician, ""Arenm only two streets from our old address, can he come over to transfer the service that here not really sure why that happened a second time so this is day number for no services.New appointment was scheduled and guess what? The same thing happened again. By this time I am like, what is going on with this company? The next attempt they didns name but it wasns not a technician 5th time? Well the customer service again said they will send someone else out to install my cable services. By this time, Is give him another shot here,"" t show up again so I spoke to another customer service rep which I thought was really good at trying to get all my questions answered but before they even have my cable service is up shet even use because my service isns a technician and he proceeded to install my cable services until he tells me, ""Well now we have to run. Oh my new bill line in your home thatll pay for it just please get the service is up and running. Then they were up and running. Whatve been trying to get this thing up and running for weeks and all you offer me is $20 off my bill. I thought it was $20 if they didnre late, so I should have over $100 taken off my bill for the services. Okay by this point I am furious. I contact customer services complaints who Comcast which they reached out to me to try to correct the issue which I was kinda happy to hear because I wasns supposed to be $50 off my bill but guess what people I only got $30 off my bill the other $20 I was promised by the other rep didnve had my services on for only 17 days and I have a bill of $228. This is too funny and the bills of a partial services I wouldnre charging me $20 a piece. What is going on with Comcast? I have had it I am now cancelling my cable services with them. This has the worse customer service.How can they continue to make the same mistakes over and over then turn around and charge you double of what your services are? I only had 135 channels plus Stars channel paid an additional $15 just for the HBO. These customer service rep should not be in this business. No longer will I deal with bad customer service. I am done dealing with Comcast in there have cited services so I am now putting my business over to DirecTV. What they are offering more channels for $100 less. So goodbye Comcast. Hello DirecTV."
"Teresa of Sherwood, AR",4/6/2016,,"Comcast has NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. They are trained people who read what is required. Their system requires you to be on the phone handed off several times until you get to a person who makes promises of a package that is never delivered. Most of the people I believe arens obvious that they don't care and hand you off a million times, hoping you get frustrated and hang up. They lie to meet quota and I only hope that my area will have more cable options in the future."
"Steven of Knoxville, TN",4/7/2016,,"First, allow me to start with an issue that transpired on day one of my move. Before I relocated from out of state to Tennessee, I contacted Comcast Customer Support. Everything was pretty smooth at that point. I was told to simply bring the equipment with me to the new home, schedule connection date and time, and be there with someone over the age of 18. Wow! That is easy enough. Unfortunately, they did not tell me that I should not pay my bill. Comcast bills a month in advance. So, when my bill was paid, the money was tied up in another section of the company that the region I moved to had no access to. Long story short, it was about 3 months before the money was returned, sent to correct address, or placed on current bill, and to top all that off, I was told I was getting disconnected for non-payment. When, in fact, I had over paid Comcast by nearly $300, and they owed me money!Now, let us move on to the final straw that made my decision indefinite to leave this company and absolute, beside horrid customer service! In Knoxville, Comcast puts a limit on the amount of Internet a household is allowed to use. Once yous, even 1000s likings. I am not one that downloads a lot of files either. I simply stream Netflix, Amazon, and use PS4 functions. Yes, the PS4 downloads some large files occasionally, but as a customer who already pays an arm and a leg for service, I expect to be able to use it without being charged more. My wife and children stay home during the day. So, with Netflix running for my toddler, that sucks up the data. We are now 3 months into our overage, and we are facing the outrageous charges of going over the allotted amount of Internet Comcast says we can use. Mind you, we already pay nearly $200 a month, but apparently nothing will satisfy the greed of this massive corporation. I hope Comcast enjoys missing my $200 a month, not including overage fees. I will be giving it to a new company servicing the Knoxville area, WoW! They have no limitations and are nearly half the price of Comcast in every aspect, including cable TV. Goodbye Comcast! Keep doing what youll find that bad business ethics will only cost you more money as your customers keep leaving you."
"Felipe of Atlanta, GA",4/7/2016,,"Minus 5 stars. I am so glad I cancelled my Comcast since I use antenna TV, no longer have a VoIP landline phone, use a smartphone and wifi spots. Comcast can no longer hold me hostage because I took control!! They sent the cable guy 3 different times just to get signal to my apartment. First cable guy made up the story that rats ate the cable, second cable guy that he couldnt figure out a wiring problem. I had to lease one of their refurbished modems (aka JUNK unreliable used electronic device) which crashed on me 4 time in 6 months and had to return them. So I spent $170 on a new modem just to get Comcast! My bill jumped from $19.95 a month to $39.95 + $4.95 ""protection plan"" a month and a $9 late fee. So they terminated my service.When I paid $86 for the past due, I thought they would reconnect. But no - they issued a ""hard""(?) disconnect as opposed to a ""soft"" disconnect. Then they pleaded to keep me as a customer. Heck no!! So now they owe me a $9.57 refund. No wonder this is the worst-rated company out there! Good riddance of Comcast because I don't need them! I fought the battle with Comcast and won!!"
"marci of Delray Beach, FL",4/7/2016,,"Upon turning on my computer, I had no internet service. This is a common problem with Comcast, so I paid no attention to it until later in the day when I still had no service. I called Comcast after going through their routine questioning, and was informed there was a problem in the area. I was told it would be fixed by 5 p.m. I requested that someone come to my home to check the problem out. They scheduled a person for the next day, (April 6) between 3-5PM. At 5.00 p.m. I received a text saying it was fixed. Of course, I still had no service. Around 8:00 p.m, I called Comcast again and spoke to someone in Columbia, who said he was a supervisor named Jason, who after the usual Comcast, ""I will help you"" and ""so sorry"" I again was told, about area problem. He in no uncertain terms told me he would call me back around 9.00 p.m. to see if the problem was solved. As I expected he did not call. The next morning I called again, and was speaking to someone in Mexico and I insisted on speaking to someone in the United States. After waiting 15 minutes, I was put through to someone in Michigan. I again explained the problem, and once again told it was an area outage. (I had asked all my neighbors if they were having a problem and they all said no.) ""So Sorry"", was the answer and they are working on the problem. I asked if my repair person was still scheduled to come and she told me no, they cancelled it because it was an high priory problem outside of my home. At this point I was furious. I called again and finally spoke to someone who spoke English and would get to the problem and reschedule the appointment for April 6. At 5.05p.m. On April 6, A Xfinity person arrives and tell me it was scheduled to go to my neighbor as his order said. My neighbor told him he was not having any problems but to go my house as I had the problem. When he came in he said he was not authorized to do anything since he had no order but he would call his manager and get permission which he did. After checking my connections in the house, he found nothing wrong. He went outside to check and went into the electrical room where the connections are and lo and behold someone had placed what they call ""a filter tap"" on my line with a yellow tag meaning a leak was discovered. The tag had no name, date or other explanation. That was the reason I had no internet. So the repairman removed it and lo and behold I had internet. I was informed that someone must have placed the tap on my wiring. He could not tell me why. Comcast could give me no answers. COMCAST LIED TO ME FOR TWO DAYS. Why are they allowed to be a business monopoly??? I have no choice in getting other service in my area."
"Lori of Saint Charles, IL",4/7/2016,,We switched from regular Comcast TV to X1. They switched out our Modem at the same time and now I can not access my Emails for 2 days and guess what they do not have 24 hour customer service via Phone? Hmmm - are they even into the 20th century - let alone the 21st?
"Janis of Warrenville, IL",4/7/2016,,When they started work to replace cables - they were out in the neighborhood at 10 p.m. the Saturday before Easter! Walking around peoplet repaired correctly last fall. Instead of doing anything about it they left the gate banging in the wind! I had to climb through mud to put a brick in front of it. I called Comcast and they said a note would be on the file so the workers wouldnt in place and crap was left in the yard. I was told someone would be here by 3:30 and it is now 6 P.M. NOBODY HAS COME! It get here tomorrow I'm filing a police report!
"Arthur of Westminster, CO",4/7/2016,,"When cable first hit the scene the most amazing thing for many people was the omission of commercial advertisements. Now Comcast charges out the ** for even basic internet service and yet they bombard their users with advertisements. Now we all know that Comcast is being afforded special compensation from the government. Our corrupt elected officials and their appointed lackeys are allowing this cable mega-giant to financially rape the general population. I as with many other people opted for elimination of telemarketing years ago. Each and every time I pay my Comcast bill I feel as though I should be filing a police report for the abuse. If I have to pay these high costs for service, I should be afforded the right to block advertisements at my discretion without impacting the quality of service provided."
"Kathi of West Valley, UT",4/8/2016,,"Comcast jumps up your bill without you knowing then bills you for the over amount. You call their department - they promise it is taken care off after months on the phone. Every month tell you it is taken care of and never is, till you are so frustrated you want to cancel your subscription and they tell you that will cost you over a hundred dollars to cancel. They have you by the neck. No matter what horrible service always goes down have to reset the box constantly. I wish that I had never signed up for this product. I have never paid a late bill in my life but this was considered late payments even after I had talked with customer service and it was suppose to be fixed - instead added up months of late fees."
"Hayley of Hackettstown, NJ",4/8/2016,,"After countless unpleasant, extensive and disappointing phone calls attempting to get to the root of my Blast Internet speed problems, being bounced from department to department, having my escalated calls cancelled and ""restarted"" multiple times, charging additional ""service"" fees, XFINITY rescinded the initial account credit offer citing that I, their ""Valued Customer"" ""called too many times"". I find it extremely disappointing and disheartening that this is what XFINITY calls customer service!"
"Linda of Sugar Land, TX",4/8/2016,,"I signed up with this internet service just 3 weeks ago. This business and its employees have done the following negative things in just this short time: It took 10 days to set up my service because Comcast stated that someone else had service at my address, although the residence had been vacant for the past three months. A service technician set up my email, with a password, and answer to a special question without giving me the information. Took over one half hour, via phone, to resolve this matter since I did not have the password or answer to the question. Why would someone even do this? Another service technician came to my apartment building to set-up service for my neighbor. He cut my internet in the process and I was out internet for four days, which caused me lost wages due to internet being necessary for my business.After speaking to a Comcast employee via phone about the above problem, I was told I would receive a call from someone shortly. No one in fact did call back. When I finally called, I found out someone set up an appointment for me without telling me or contacting me in any way. After 4 days of no service, I finally interacted with an employee who was both intelligent and courteous. He told me about the connection problem and fixed the problem. However, I then saw a $70 charge for the visit. The phone employee stated that the charge was valid and that they are not responsible for wiring. After explaining the situation, the employee did remove the charge, but only because it happened within the first 30 days of receiving service.There have been more issues than the above, but those are the most egregious. I researched any and all internet service providers in this area and would have gone with any other service if there had actually been an option. After I move from this location, I will never again use this service unless once again I have no option."
"Robert of Ft Lauderdale, FL",4/8/2016,,Im really at a loss for words at how badly I've been treated.
"Dave of Eagan, MN",4/9/2016,,"When watching Comcast television shows I sometimes need to use the on-demand feature to catch up on the show I missed. When doing this I take note of the length of the show and whether the show can be fast forwarded through commercials. I try to not watch shows that cans necessary. If I wait more than a week, some shows have less commercials and show up as a shorter time than they had when originally aired. Lately Is."
"Robert of Richmond, CA",4/10/2016,,Comcast is blocking NBA games airing on TBS and ESPN via Sling TV that are also aired on Comcast Sports Network. This is illegal.
"Clarice of Avondale Estates, GA",4/10/2016,,"From the very start I have had billing problems with Comcast. They do not try to correct their oops up just tries to fast talk you as if you are that dumb and not listening. When I first received my equipment in the mail I installed it correctly but did not get a signal. I called Comcast. The rep tried sending a signal and it failed. I was told since it was a problem on their end I would not be charged for a tech to come to my home, well I was. The tech comes out and the jack that is in the room with the TV does not work so the cable was ran to a different room. The tech ordered a tech to come out the next day to fix the jack. I asked the tech ""would I be charged for this?"". He stated ""NO"", I was. I called customer service after seeing my online bill. Got the run around from the rep. Had to ask to speak to a manager. The manager did not want to honor the false information given by their employees. All she did was half off. No fair because I would had the extra fees if it was not for their people but fine I settled. I go online and pay my bill in full now. I have a bill showing I had previous unpaid fees as well as the charges for them sending techs out that were on the first bill that I paid. I'M DONE! Comcast has just lost a good paying customer. I advise people to stop dealing with Comcast and maybe they will get their act together and start valuing their customers that keep them in business."
"Tia of Indianapolis, IN",4/10/2016,,"I walked in Comcast cable store on April 8, 2016. Paid $350. Walked out with my boxes. Was told to come home. Hook them up. Call to activate. I called said I had to pay $158 more. They want my bank card number I said ""no"". Walk back in the store the next day. On their end its now Sunday. Waited all day - nothing. Called. Was on hold for 1 hour to hear them say ""Itt get Comcast. They take your money and don't give you service or your money back. I will contacts attorney."
"Erin of New York, NY",4/10/2016,,"I cancelled my service within the time frame to receive MY 30-day money back guarantee. This April and I still have not received my check. Is been two months now! When I called today the representative told me it was NEVER sent. What do you mean it was never sent??? HOW CAN YOU OPERATE A BUSINESS LIKE THIS? NO ONE IS ON THE SAME PAGE. So if you expect to work with a company of integrity, this is not the one. DO NOT TRUST THEM. If you work for Comcast quit. You are more than a crappy business with a terrible process."
"daniel of Bennington, VT",4/12/2016,,"After several months of increased fees and cost and failed attempts to reduce the Comcast cost, I was forced to cancel their service. During this conversation I was given a date it would be cancelled and told that my e-mail would still be good for 60 days. 6 days later, my e-mail access was denied. After numerous hours, phone calls, text conversations and visiting a store 60 miles away, the only thing Comcast can say is that they made a mistake, that the communication of their representatives was uninformed and that they can do nothing to restore my 5 years of lost e-mails stored. One representative told me he could offer a reduced price to sign back up with them while another told me he could do nothing unless I provided proof of who I was and a death certificate proving that my mother died as her name was on the account. Unimaginable statements that you simply cans approach is unethical and lacks any compassion for the customer. I was given the name and number of the manager for customer service in the regions... Sheri ** in Philadelphia. Her number is **. I called several times, left messages and she never returned my calls. Not once.They have cost me countless hours of my time, lost tickets that I cannot retrieve for a scheduled chaperoned trip with my daughter and her schoolmates to DC as well as lost business/personal information that I simply can not replace. The stress, frustration, and disbelief of how I've been treated and how my situation was handled is through the roof. They lie, have no idea how to solve difficult problems and seem indifferent to real issues. I am hoping the Mr. Roberts, the CEO reads this as well as his recently appointed customer service VP, Charlie Herrin. If they do, they would have the decency to look into this debacle."
"Milton of Westminster, CO",4/13/2016,,In general most companies who offer a service to the public struggles with providing world class customer service. My company is no different. There are many contributing factors that plays into companies not being able to obtain such lofty goals. Factors like the employee pool companies have to hire from. There is also poor management decisions making that dont have access to any notes that are placed on an account. I then called their billing department. I was told that I should have to pay the $32.62 because I moved to a location that already had TV service available. I was then transferred to their win back department to get my issue resolved. That agent was even more clueless than the first two agent I spoke with. She was very unrelenting in her position that I was not going to get a refund and I had to pay the $32.62 bill. Problem is at that point I didns lack of empathy and Comcast sense of disorganization (one department not know what the other department is doing) I will never use their service again even if I have to pay double for another service provider.
"Janice of Fresno, CA",4/13/2016,,"First, a little personal information. I am disabled and on a fixed income. I cant a luxury item for me. I signed up with Comcast Xfinity online, bought a modem, and scheduled an installation for Monday, April 4, 2016. I get a reminder call about the appointment and the technician showed up on time -- things are looking promising. After looking around the tech discovers that there isnt take long, and his supervisor says to call Comcast if I havent hear anything I use Comcastt been told that this is anything but a simple install and can do nothing. At this point I start calling Comcast and raising hell. Each time I call I speak to a different person and each tells me a slightly different story.Hope appears on Sunday 4/10/2016 when, after more fruitless calls, I am called by a very nice Comcast woman whose job is resolving big Comcast ** (not her words). She is sympathetic and apologetic and seems genuinely determined to get everything sorted out for me. She says shet get any of this information directly from my ""fixer."" Today, 4/12/2016 It transfer me to any specific person, so apparently she was lying to me too.The current word on my installation is that theyt sure). I have informed Comcast that Im hanging up on them. Id jump on it in a minute. There aren't words enough to say how much I hate Comcast at this point."
"nicole of Owings Mills, MD",4/13/2016,,"I called to speak to someone about my account and the first rep was unable to assist me. They transferred me and had me on hold for 30 min until I hung up. I called back again, and explained my frustration to the second rep who never apologized and stuck me right back into the queue. Then I was on hold for 45 min until a recording came on and said that the call center was closed and to call back another day. The phone then hung up on me. Worst ever!!! I despise Comcast! They changed their name but left the same horrible service! I wish I had another option at my community!"
"Mendare of Hollywood, FL",4/14/2016,,"Ive never agreed for, and she told me that the fact that I cancelled it within a month she can remove the Early termination fee. She told me she removed it the same day. I checked a week later, it was still here. I called again and they told me they will call me back in 48 hours and they never did. Every time I called they keep on telling me the same thing for the whole month. I am so pissed for what they did because I've been a great customer for almost 10 years, always paid my bills on time. I am so ready to get rid of this horrible company."
"scott of Branford, CT",4/14/2016,,"As an executive with of a number of technologies companies Id want to know about it. It working. I called Ryan back on the work phone number he provided. He said he had disconnected our phone equipment on the understanding that we didnt recall what cables he had disconnected in the garage. He questioned some equipment that Comcast had installed when we added Comcast phone service previously. He said he didnd be there at noon.Noon, no show. Texted and called without response. Finally at 1:30 Ryan responded that he wasnt. He gave me a ticket # for the current escalated issue and said someone would call back within 2 hours guaranteed. I told him we were on Eastern time but I would stay up to wait. No call ever came.My wife called the next day. We were told the service visit was still scheduled for Sunday. She was on the line for some time trying to get it moved up. She was told someone would need to call back to reschedule and that would take place within the house. No call ever came. Friday, she called and we were told soonest possible was Sunday 10:00 am. We decided to wait.Sunday AM, It make sense based on our experience. She explained that the service call was cancelled on April 9th but couldnt understand why a supervisor couldnt accept that. After some time on hold that was changed to Monday 9:00-12:00 am. Monday AM 2 service techs arrive and fix the problem in 5 mins by reconnecting the wiring properly. Comcast has achieved converting a loyal customer who uses all Comcast services for home and business into someone who will be reviewing other options. I know you have complex systems and products but the complete lack of respect and execution are beyond comprehension. Whether my accounts remain with Comcast will be based on a response from an executive within your company."
"Angel of Houston, TX",4/15/2016,,"Comcast TOTALLY sucks. They are dishonest. Bad receptions. When you call them to fix receptions issues, itt charge you for. You'll spend countless hours to fix your receptions and billing and still they end up owing you money. Better to go with AT&T."
"Harrison of Avon, IN",4/15/2016,,"Is when I found it was never sent to me. They ended up getting everything to me then come to find out my house was set up for dish and I would need a technician to come out to get this fixed, of course they are so busy and weeks behind no one was available. The first lady I was speaking was pretty rude and I was losing my patience at this point. I then just told her to cancel my service and Ill need to send everything back and my account would be adjusted. I sent everything back and received email confirmation that they had gotten it all back. I thought that was easy and went well, I was wrong. I then kept receiving monthly statements. When I would call, every single time I would have to explain the situation. Every single time I would get the same answer which was that it would be taken care of and it takes a few weeks to go through. Every time I was given a ticket number to give to the next person so I didnt even make difference I still had to explain everything to everyone.Most of the time I would get transferred from one person to the next. The latest phone call in the beginning of March I was told this was going to go to her supervisor and they would have a hearing and review it and I should hear back in a couple days. I never heard back. At this point Is turned into a collection agency?I called Comcast right after I got this phone call and tried to be as polite as possible, I spoke with a lady named Debbie and she has promised me this would be taken care of and she would be calling back once she finds out more. I asked her what happened the last 6 times I have tried to fix this, her answer was nothing. I was informed that each time I called and was given a ticket number none of the Comcast employees did anything about it. How does this make any sense? It is beyond ridiculous and disappointing companies like this survive."
"Christine of Downers Grove, IL",4/15/2016,,"We just moved into our new house and are trying to get a fence put in but have not been able to do so due to Comcasts notice to try to get this fixed. The fence is being put in tomorrow and now that I have finally gotten Comcasts customer service is. I have been a loyal customer for over 5 years and pay a great deal of money for their service every month. It is absolutely ridiculous that they cannot even get someone you back. How can a company that large have such terrible customer service? They are, by far, the worst company to deal with."
"John of Spokane, WA",4/15/2016,,"We have been fighting with this company's courtesy service department for 2 months now. I am at my wits end. Our voice services keep getting shut off and then back on weeks later, our TV boxes freeze. Kids Zone will not load and the remotes decide to do what they want whenever they want. We have never ever been late on our bills. We always pay early, there is no excuse for this. This company just does not care about their customers or the equipment. They are too concerned with trying to up their ratings with newest and greatest equipment. They did not take time to work out the bugs or their customer service skills. I hate their TV service with every fiber of my being. Internet is fantastic but every other product is shoddy and subpar."
"Debi of Corvallis, OR",4/15/2016,,"Went to create an online log in to manage my account. The online system found my account but wanted to send a verification code to the phone number on file which is an old landline and not text capable. Thought I could find a solution using the chat feature. They were unable to help because, although I can provide all account details, they cant happen to carry those things around with me. I was also told that the last 4 digits of my ssn number that just worked online, were incorrect. This is internet/tv services, not a high security financial provider. Itt happen to carry their bill around with them."
"Seun of Lanham, MD",4/16/2016,,"I called Comcast customer service on Monday 4/11/16 to complain that my Internet service is super slow, which Jo, the agentt make sense because if It activate my TV cable Xfinity Service is because the modem I got is not 2-in-1 (wifi modem router) and he assured me that once I get a modem router that the service will be up and running. So today which is 4/15/16 I went back to Best Buy and exchanged the box with a 2-in-1 modem router and I called Comcast back. But for 5 hours, precisely 1 pm till 6 pm, they completely wasted my time and told me that the new modem does not support voice call, and I was like ""How has TV got to do with a phone service?"" And I requested that what else can we do to make it happen which the guy JEROME told me that I have to get another modem from theirs which means I will have to pay $10 a month and I will also have to pay $59.99 for a technician fee.Now what annoyed me was that they be ripping customers off with some unreasonable charges. If it is that compulsory to have a modem from you guys why not sell it or have the money paid for specific range of time? Why must it be a forever payment thing? Thatt know their JD t same database yall out but I just got to hold my breath, for wasting my time for 2 solid days and yet came up with a trash service option. It's so annoying and unrespectful to customers."
"Shanna of Jacksonville, FL",4/17/2016,,"Comcast/Xfinity is by far the worst Cable & Internet provider ever. I completely agree with the reviews, because they are indeed accurate and this I know because Im constantly calling Comcast to report Internet problems such as: slow connections although Is a complete waste to call Customer Service, because all that do is lie and give you the runaround. This is the second largest bill in my home which is ridiculous. IBill Detailss there when youll see a Credit on YOUR NEXT BILL."" ICREDITt believe me? Check your bill!!!I think we all need to come together and start a  against Comcast/Xfinity. Im so fed up with them. You could be calling about a problem youre thinking about is: ""Would you like to make a payment?"" If there was another Service Provider in my area, I could guarantee that Comcast would have no business and this is why they feel like they can and is taking advantage of their customers. There are thousands of people who I talk to who call in to vent about their unhappiness with Comcast. What a hike and disgrace!!!"
"H. of Colorado Springs, CO",4/17/2016,,"I decided to try out Xfinity. I ordered internet and tv. Received the self-install kit. I stalled it but it failed to operate due outside not connected. I called and made an appointment for tech to come and connect. First tech showed, he could not fit it. Rescheduled, same thing happened. Rescheduled third time on Sunday afternoon. No show. They want to reschedule again and I said, ""Hell no. Dont recommend this company to anyone. CenturyLink much better. Returning everything tomorrow."
"Don R  of Tucson, AZ",4/20/2016,,"Comcast is HYPOCRITICAL using credit reporting agencies. While using this practice, Comcast refuses to contribute previous account information on behalf of any customer. Comcast WILL NOT use previous Comcast Customert care! Comcast does not use that info anyway!I am demanding, [EVERY COMCAST CUSTOMER SHOULD], Comcast enter previous Comcast Account information in the Credit Reporting Agencies! If Comcast is going to determine a customer's eligibility for an account, using a credit score from one of the three credit reporting agencies! Just tell Comcast if they do not then you will go to another service company. Remember if Comcast will not do as you want - YOU CAN CHANGE! Discrimatory practices for Not Wanting Credit - cash only. (ID Theft 2003 & 2004 - After Chapter 11 - MY debts cleared - Made choice never have credit again - Why make it easy for someone else?!)"
"Bill of Cape Coral, FL",4/20/2016,,I called a few months ago about how HIGH my bill was getting and the agent indicated he could reduce it by enrolling me into this new program. He did and two bills later my charges were almost what I had been paying before. He lied about the final cost of the service. The service charge was lower but now the FEES were higher. Comcast is for the birds and I would never recommend them to anyone. It takes forever to get a REAL person on the line.
"Linda of Chicago, IL",4/21/2016,,"Received letter from Comcast that due to a recent Audit, it was found that they have not been charging me for a box since the start of this service. If I donve had my service for over a year and a half and now you want to tack on more fees. Im out so much, but now its a nice payday for them."
"Jesus of Sebring, FL",4/21/2016,,"On April 8, 2016 at around 5:36 we spoke to a person named Youling (unsure of spelling of names) about the triple play package that we saw is for 129.99 plus tax and we mentioned that it will not be higher than that and she said no. We also let her know that day that we want the same phone number we have with century link transferred over and that we want the channel Baby first tv, and she said no problem and that it will be done. On April 13, 2016 around 9:00 we were supposed to get our installation done and one. They said they came and knocked, did not happen. So we had to call again and we spoke to Lizzy who helped to get a technician over to install. And we spoke with her and verified we were getting our same phone number as well as our channels including what we requested (baby first tv), and she stated Yes we will and that we should not worry and sorry for the inconvenience. April 13, 2016 around 12:00. Now when the technician, David, came and started installing we noticed the house phone number had completely changed to a new one and that we did not have the channel we requested. And we told him to stop the installation and let's get this fixed first before continuing. David calls Comcast regarding the channel baby first tv and he spent quite some time on the phone with them and then said the engineers were working on it. And so then he called them about our home phone number and right then and there we found out that Comcast never did anything about us getting our number transferred over to them.The importance of our home phone number is that All our doctors have that number and already my wife missed an important call about the MRI of her spine. Our family have that home phone number and 2 members of our family (one on each side) have cancer, and friends have that home phone number (which my family did not get to contact my friends for a surprise party they did for my birthday).David said we needed to do a third party verification, which was the first time it was mentioned to us, and we did it with him still here. He told us that it was done and that in three days it should be fixed. Then we went back to the channel and we were told that in 24 hours the problem should be fixed. And so we believed him and he finished and left. Later that day we found out they did not have baby first tv in our area. The technician left the cable on top of the ground in which the cable was cut and we did not have phone, Internet, or cable for a day. And all they did was connect it with a tool and still to this day it is left on top.April 18, 2016 around 8:00 p.m we spoke to a guy named Rolf about our home phone number and why it has not changed to our original and requested number yet. And he said they could not transfer it and that it is century links fault. Notice it has been five days already and they left us without our important calls and never notified us about the issue. Rolf refused to transfer us to his supervisor for a very long time and instead of hanging up and waiting for a call, which most likely would never happen, we stayed on hold until finally we spoke to Terrance (in Michigan) the supervisor. We explained to Terrance our situation about our phone number as well as all the issues we have been having since the 8th and he apologized and was doing his ""best"" to assist us. He said that we should have our number fixed soon, that they already put in the computer to their department that does the transfers and that they will contact us. Even said he would give us a courtesy call the next day to keep us informed of what is going on. Terrance did not call the next day but Rolf did just to say the same thing that it is not fixed. Terrance, going back to the 18th, also tried to help with baby first tv but said it was not in our area and sorry for that, and said if there was a movie channel we want that he would add. But our package was supposed to have all movie channels. He also mentioned that he will not charge us for phone until we finally get our number fixed. On April 19, 2016 we spoke to a lady named Stephanie (in Michigan) about our phone issue and she said we would get it this week. And then she was trying to help us with our package but then we got disconnected. April 21, 2016 we received the bill from Comcast and the bill is way higher than what was advertised and mentioned on the 8th of April. We do not need business with people who take advantage of those who are disabled. We did mention to them that I am a 100% disabled veteran and that my wife is deaf and we have many medical problems and that we needed to be accommodated."
"Polly of Everett, WA",4/21/2016,,"I am renting an apartment and the landlord pays the cable bill and charges us for the service. Basically, in essence, there is no cable when all through the day there are constant interruptions that never stop... If I watch a program and there is an engaging aspect of the show going on, it's always being stopped and missed with all of these constant video signal interruptions, and the digital squares bump up, and then it goes dark, only to momentarily try to show the show again, but then missed what was engaged that brought interest to the show. I hate cable. This goes on for weeks and weeks. I hate the expense for the horrible service that is always constant. Always video signal interruptions with a status code of 225. Nothing is ever fixed. Why do companies get away with charging so much money for that kind of service??? Is this how America is going to turn out to be? To be treated so poorly as a customer and as people? So disappointed... very disappointed. I can do without television."
"Annette of Kennesaw, GA",4/22/2016,,"For several days I went online and checked out Comcast and what they offered. I did a live chat session with one of their representatives. During the chat I asked for them to tell me exactly what additional charges and fees would appear on my bill. She told me that there was a $80.00 fee for one-time installation charges -- a $50.00 professional install and a $30.00 install fee for new outlet. At that time I told her I was not interested in switching to Comcast due to the 2 install fees. A day later a representative called my cell phone to discuss why I did not want to continue with Comcast. I explained the fees issue. He told me that the install fees will be waived. I told him I did not trust that they would be waived. He told me that he would send me a email that shows the fees would be waived, which he did. The email shows one-time fees $0.00, along with the breakdown of my bill and my install appointment time.When the tech was done with the installation he asked me to sign the completion order, which was on a iPad. As I scrolled up to see what it said, I saw where all these fees were added. I questioned him about it. He replied that they were standard on all install orders and because I have the email showing the cost is too $0.00 that it is already in the system and I will not see the charges it on my bill. That was a lie. All them charges were on my bill. When I called Comcast they told me they showed no notes saying that I was to receive free install, and that the tech was the one who was supposed to remove them charges. Since when does a technician decided what goes on a customer bill??? As I continued to explain that I have a email form your company that I was not to be charged, she told me, ""Well I don't see a email saying that, therefore I will not remove the charges."" I offered to send her the email from her company saying the fees will be $0.00. She told me to take copies to a XFINITY store and talk to them about it. So even though I have in writing that the install fees would be $0.00 they will not honor their own word!!! Be advised that Comcast will not keep their word, even if you have it in writing from them."
"Papa of College Park, GA",4/23/2016,,"This review is about the Xfinity internet service we currently have. We signed up with Xfinity 2 months ago as we left AT&T. That was our biggest mistake for the year 2016. Indeed, at the time we were signing up, nobody made us aware of the 300 GB limitation. Xfinity will allow you to go over your 300 GB 3 times as a ""courtesy"", and thereafter you will be charged $10.00 for any overage of 50 GB. The people at Xfinity I talked to over the phone today were very uncomfortable explaining this to me. One of them (a manager) even told me that there were no limitations to the use of the internet (300 GB do not sound like a limit to him). He also said that AT&T has a limit of 200 GB which was very inaccurate (we left AT&T 2 months ago). The Xfinity individual I talked even tried to sell me a deal of unlimited internet if I agreed to pay $35.00 more. I will tell all my contact about this highway robbery, and very funny way of doing business."
"Brenda of Lebanon, OR",4/23/2016,,"I have been with Comcast 3 years. Am leaving them and going with DirecTV. I have phone, cable, internet and a alarm system through them. I got my alarm system hooked up last year. Mind you it has not worked right since. In the beginning when I had my service hooked up I got the protection plan added. Two weeks ago I have to have someone come out because my alarm system was down and I could not get my video cameras to come up. I got my bill and I was CHARGED for them coming out. I called them today and they told me that I had to pay for another protection plan for my alarm system. I told them ""I was never told this when you put my system in"". All the lady on the phone said was ""Oh"". I refuse to pay this bill. They can eat it. They have got enough money out of me. I have been paying over 200$ a month and now they want $300 this month. I can not afford that. Am not SSD. There is no way I can afford that. They dont care. As long as am far away from Comcast."
"George of Emerson, GA",4/24/2016,,"One word says it all... overseas call center. I was overcharged on my second bill and I call to discuss. First of all, when you call customer service you should not hear people clapping and counting down numbers in the background. You could tell they were trying to meet a quota or some other goal that was not customer service related. Sounded like an unprofessional sales center to me (definitely not customer service center). I got put on hold numerous times for unusually long periods of time compared to the short answers I received. When I complained about the background cheering, I got put on hold for a longer period of time. I was likely transferred out of their party and into a private room. Well, 15 to 20 minutes into the call, I realized they were not going to help me with my bill. After the call was ended, I received 5 calls from the same number and they hung up on me each time.When is Comcast (Xfinity) going to learn that overseas call centers hurts their business. The few times I have talked to a state side representative, I felt like I was talking to a pro. If you call and get an overseas call center, just hang up and save yourself a lot of frustration. As soon as Google Fiber gets up and running, Comcast will go the way of Ma Bell (old telephone company that is no longer in business). For now, I will try AT&T or DirecTV. Comcast overseas call center has cost them another customer."
"J. N. of Lake Forest Park, WA",4/24/2016,,"In the process of switching from CenturyLink to Comcast. After reading several other reviewerss permission). It is clear in the phone call that they have majorly screwed up. It seems to me, there should be a Federal law that requires cable companies to send out emails or letters that fully cover the terms of the contract, the fees, and anticipated state/local taxes. This would keep Comcast and other companies accountable for their business practices. What other service companies does one enter into a contract with that doesn't let you read the terms of the contract first? Who is a lawyer out there that knows how to get the ""ball rolling"" on trying to get a law like this passed? There is absolutely no reason why cable companies cannot send summarizing email contracts to their potential subscribers that recount the specific terms of the agreement, the fees, etc. Help please!"

"Paul of Springfield, MA",4/25/2016,,"Been dealing with a nightmare at Comcast for at least 3 years now. I pay $90 a month for high-speed internet and receive half the speed I pay for. I have to keep calling there for them to turn my internet speed up. Then my service works good for a few days and itve been through modems, wireless internet boxes, and still nothing but problems. They are no doubt in my mind throttling back on internet service."
"Maggie of Wheaton, Other",4/25/2016,,"Unfortunately, my landscaper cut my cable when planting in the backyard. I called Comcast to schedule repairs and was told that it would be addressed the following day. I took off work to be present, and waited all day - no one showed up. When I called Comcast to check on the appointment, I was told I was the last call of the day. Again, waited, but no one showed up. I called the next day to ask what happened, and was told I was on the schedule for that day. I waited and guess what - no one showed up. I made multiple calls throughout that day to check on the schedule, and got the same lines and routine by each representative. They have a script, and they read the script. They tell you what you want to hear, even though it is a blatant lie.I finally spoke to a supervisor, and he was worse that all of the agents. He had no better process or solution to the problem - very sad, sad customer service. They have no idea how to solve a problem. They have broken processes which are meaningless and worse yet, I donm still without service and wondering if I should just switch to AT&T. If I could rate them ""zero"" stars, I would."
"Gloria of Schaumburg, IL",4/25/2016,,"The Situation: Recently, my cable/internet bill went up almost $20/month. $10 was for a credit that had dropped off and the rest was related to an increase in various subscriber fees. Called Comcast billing dept. Called twice. The first time, I was given the run-around then hung up on. The second time, after questioning the increases, I was told by the rep that the credit was only good for 12 months (which was now up) and that the fees were standard to all subscribers. Ok, the fees I understand and accept. I then pulled the original carbon copy of the contract from my files and explained that it is written that the credit applied to the length of the contract (24 months). The rep claimed their computer system states it is only for 12 months and that they cannot pull the original paperwork because it is company policy to destroy old records after 12 months. They refused to give an email address for me to send a copy of the contract to for verification, again citing company policy. Instead, Is only response to anything I said was that I would have to pay the early termination fee if I were to cancel service.I first tried Comcast 3.5 years ago. When what the salesman had promised was not reflected in the first, second, or third monthd been fairly happy so far. After this ordeal, I will never do business with Comcast again. Itm switching to another provider; one that can not only match what I had with Comcast but is willing to reimburse the Comcast early termination fee."
"Martin of Flemington, NJ",4/27/2016,,A Comcast technician came out to my house and cut my copper wires coming to my house. I've been trying for over a month to get Comcast to fix the wires and they just put me on hold all the time. They are refusing to do anything about it.
"bill of Gatlinburg, TN",4/27/2016,,"What Refund???!!! Jan 2016 decided we had enough with Comcast and switched to AT&T/DirecTV. 1-25-16: Sent all hardware by UPS back to Com - 5 pieces. 2-5 received statement saying I have a 61.58 refund. 2-9-16: Called in about refund. CSR Fatimah of Fla says they DID receive ALL 5 parts, AND that I have a refund of 181.58, which will be SENT OUT in 2 wks. 3-17-16: I called and Gabriel/Billing ID ** says refund WAS NOT PROCESSED, that she will submit today, take 6 wks. 4-6-16: I called  on status. Mike ID ** says he cant receive all the equip and were holding up my ck. She couldnt made that know on 4-6 call. However, when I quoted her the serial numbers of equipment, UPS tracking Number, and UPS receipt # (that fortunately I had kept) - she quickly created a new ticket #**, of which we did receive an email stating it had been created which we had not gotten in previous calls. However, now she says that it will take another 7 days for review of matching the UPS receipt with what equipment they received. (She and I had matched up all serials numbers on the equip, with UPS receipt.) THEN it will take another 7-14 days after that to . (Now on the phone for 1 hr 7 min at this point.) Asked her how often do they train them on how to lie to a customer... I then asked her again for 3rd time for a Supervisor, the one who would approve a pay raise for her... on hold for 20 min... . I reminded her thatset me up' to have a real Superv call me back in 90 min. Stay tuned."
"Patricia of San Jose, CA",4/27/2016,,"My mother has been paying for Comcast cable services since January 3, 2011 but she did not receive her cable boxes until yesterday, April 25, 2016.

Please refer to ticket # **. I have tried to called multiple times but I keep getting transferred to multiple departments without resolution to this matter. My mother is entitled to a refund of the payments that she had made for cable services that she did not receive between January 3, 2011 to April 25, 2016. I would appreciate it if someone would help me resolve this issue, promptly."
"RJ of Houston, TX",4/28/2016,,"It seems that their system is not robust and actually quite fragile. Each time it rains the cable internet service goes out and it takes days to fix. They must not know how to learn how to make the service reliable for some reason. It do anything when service is out... using a phone is not a good option. For a company this big, itt get a handle on robustness and reliability."

I wish so much there was some real competition because they would be run right out of business."
"Breana of Ann Arbor, MI",5/1/2016,,"They are the worst company to deal with for internet services. Avoid them at all costs. They told me one price, and I got an email for a different price. They told me that I could set up one way, and then told me I cannot do it that way. Their customer service is literally the worst I have ever experienced. If there was another option I would not continue services, but they are the only company that services my address. WORST COMPANY EVER. 100% do not recommend."

"Com of Steamboat Springs, CO",5/1/2016,,"Every time I try to watch a show online, it will skip backwards during a commercial. This forces me to watch the commercials over and over and over as I wait for the show to return. Then the show comes back on. It has been reset to the beginning. When I try to get back to the show where it skipped away, I am forced to watch another round of commercials. This is an endless battle."
"Dale of Augusta, GA",5/2/2016,,"First they blocked access to my property due to their problem with another customer that is not associated with my address in any way. Second they made me bring proof of ownership to store to correct their error. Third, in store has no place to be served unless you stand, elderly and infirm alike. There was no one paying attention to anyone in lobby. One older man had to leave because he could not stand as long as they made us wait. It was difficult for me due to physical condition as well. Then the attendant was abrupt and totally lacking kindness. Fourth, they are making me wait until they decide to unblock my property due to their error even after I gave them proof of ownership. It has been 5 days now that I am waiting. If I could use another company for cable I would never use Comcast."
"Melissa of Champaign, IL",5/4/2016,,"We requested a change of address due a move. They made such a mess that our service was interrupted the day after we called, instead of the moving date we provided. We had to call several times to try and resolve the issue. This was 3 months ago. Now, our service was turned off because of lack of payment. We were not told that once you move, they give you another account number; mind you we never even received a bill in the mail and our account online said we did not owe anything. They told us we had to pay an exorbitant amount of money that does not make sense since our plan is quite cheap. They verified and said that we changed the plan!!! All we wanted was an offing change of address and they are so inept that they ** up something that is so freaking simple. At the moment, we are still on the phone (3 months after the move, and after numerous calls) and they have the audacity of keeping us on the plan they changed, which is more expensive. They are stating that that plan has a discount... After almost an hour on the phone, now they tell us that our previous plan does not apply in our new address. Apparently, low IQ is a requirement in this company."
"Autry of Huntsville, AL",5/4/2016,,"I call the Comcast customer service officials to speak with a representative. When she answered the phone she was very rude. The first thing she asked was, ""would you like to upgrade your service,"" and I replied. ""No I do not. I call to see if I could get a lower rate with another plan."" She hung the phone up on me. So I called DIRECTV and ordered their service, which was $150.00 cheaper. Comcast xfinity has very rude representatives and very bad customer service. I will never order services with Comcast xfinity again and I will not recommend their services to anyone."
"Stephanie of Sacramento, CA",5/5/2016,,"I've been a loyal Comcast customer for years. Today, I tried to get an extension for a couple of days, because I had just lost my job and wanted to wait a little while longer to pay it off. Not only did they refuse to give it to me (even if we just owe $80, and I was just asking for five days), they also took the time to tack on extra fees in addition to our monthly bill, and they tripled the amount we owe to $292. I am broke and in-between jobs, and I rely on the internet in order to find work. How am I supposed to pay that off? I am very angry with them and I hope they rot in Hades."
"Heather of Billerica, MA",5/6/2016,,My experience with Comcast has been so stressful that I can hardly sleep. For one my bill is 688 and 80% of that is overcharges! My privacy was violated as they let someone have access to my account with my permission and without my SS number. I have called numerous times to try and get answers to why this happened and spoke to numerous people. One lady laughed at me and was extremely rude. Another man told me the person who tried accessing my account gave them my SS number. Every time I call I get different answers or they have no clue what It added but don't have time to write a novel.
"Lisa of Ceresco, MI",5/6/2016,,"Nightmare!!! Everything is automated. Customer service when you call is either a computer or someone out of state or out of country. No follow up or resolution to problems when you call. Have been trying to get have cable/internet installed for two months. No phone calls back when promised. They were trying to bid it out to lay the line from the house to pole across the street. Basically if your house is newly built or not wired to the cable service along the road, plan on never getting it installed because they do NOT want new customers apparently that require more work than just switching out equipment."
"jill of Newark, DE",5/6/2016,,"Comcast is a joke and I WILL NEVER give them my money. They are a very greedy company and they do not care about their customers or employees. I wons never nothing on cable. The home security is a joke. If you change your location and you're at the end of your agreement you are automatically place in a new contract. They do not care about life events. They want the early termination fee, no question asked. DO NOT DO IT. Not having is better than the stress."
"Carl of Concord, CA",5/6/2016,,Comcast cable will pixelate and the sound cuts in and out throughout every show or movie. The customer service knows this is a problem but they just run you in circles and leave you stranded. They also block access to their programming via the internet even though you are a paid subscriber. An example is the Starz channel app is available to stream directly via the internet connection but Comcast blocks access to it. You will see a long list of all the cable providers that allow you to authenticate but you will NOT find Comcast. My only hope is they will be put out of business by the streaming services. Itt have to pay for all the crap channels Comcast forces you to pay for just to get the few that you would like to have.
"Marjory of Murray, UT",5/7/2016,,"I am writing this review to warn people that Comcast will double your monthly charges and justify it. I decided to cut my cable. I dont see paying for television. I did, however, want to keep my internet. I use it everyday. I was told that my internet cost would be 89.99 a month even though I do not have TV. I can get internet for cheaper from any other provider. Why would they think I would pay that much for internet. Then I looked at their deals online and for internet only it was 39.99. Needless to say I don't think I will go back. I have resolved all of my issues using my cellphone provided (not Comcast/Xfinity)."
"Kimberly of Hazlet, NJ",5/8/2016,,"I have been a Comcast xFinity customer for 3 years, But I have finally had enough and am switching. Before moving I had been a Optimum customer for years with very few issues and expected similar service from Comcast. Unfortunately this has not been the case. Consistently since we moved in we have problems with all 3 services. About every 6 mos they have sent someone out to ""fix"" the problem. They check all the connections, replace our equipment and it gets no better. Things have gotten so bad that multiple times a day we have no phone or internet for varying lengths of time sometimes a couple minutes, usually longer up to 3 or 4 hours.With the TV at least once a day try to change the channel and all you get is an error message telling you to try again later. Forget trying to watch something on demand there is a connection problem error message more often than not; and when you actually get to watch something dont fast forward to get back to where you were. Customer service will promise you anything to get you off the phone, but they don't follow through with promised credits or adjustments. Oh and if your bill says you ordered an on demand movie when no one was home forget a credit, They would rather claim someone broke in and watched a movie than issue a credit."
"Ivy of Murfresboro, TN",5/9/2016,,"I called because my internet was running slow. They said I could take it to the store and swap it out. I dont enough for them so send someone out. So I call back 6 months later. Same issue and my bill almost doubled after the first year - $55.00 to $95.00. I understand an annual increase but 5-10 dollars should be enough. They told me if I didns not."" She sent me to someone else who was magical. She APOLOGIZED. She put in for someone to come out next day and put a small credit on the account for maybe $20.00. She even let me choose my service window for Saturday, 08:00-10:00. 10:01 rolls around and I am on the phone with Comcast. ""Is he still coming?"" ""Yeah he was running a little late and changed it to 10:00-12:00."" Thanks for the call and the heads up geez.He gets out there which wasnt ever get that, why aren't I charged for up to 40? This has been a nightmare. I called in when I got my invoice because I had requested to speak to a supervisor 3 times with a promise of a callback within 24-48 hours. It has been weeks.I got this invoice and due to the problem still not being fixed and not having a supervisor call me back I asked for the bill to be credited as a 1x we are sorry and want to keep your business peace offering. They advised me unless I turn in the box or pay for another tech to come out they can not and will not. It has to be fixed before they will credit a future invoice. It is a never ending circle. I get it you bill in advance, but what about all the past issues. It has been a stage 5 event and I hate Comcast. 2 out of the 10 people act like they have a soul and it is a shame. Jesus take the wheel when it comes to this company. They are terrible and have very minimal customer service. I never thought I would say this but, you get nicer people and better people at Verizon... And they are the devil. Worst company out there."
"Michele of Denver, CO",5/9/2016,,"According to 24/7 Wall St and research survey group Zogby Analytics. Polled adults regarding the quality of customer service at 151 of Americas best-known companies in 15 industries. ""Comcast has had bottom-ranked customer service for seven consecutive years. Comcast had the worst customer service reviews of any company this year by a wide margin. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. 1. Comcast > Pct. ratings poor: 28.3%. At 28.3%, more respondents ranked their experience with the company as poor than any other company. Furthermore, 54.4% of those surveyed claimed that their overall customer experience was negative, nearly 10 percentage points higher than the next worst rated company. This is Comcasts Comcast #3 for the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. Consumerist Named Comcast THE WORST COMPANY IN AMERICA. Comcast finds itself at the bottom of the American Consumer Satisfaction Indexs customer satisfaction near the bottom of the telecom industry. Shall I go on.One customers story. I have been with Comcast for over 18 years. The past several years it is rare that I don't spend hours on the phone on a monthly basis attempting to correct problems with the service or the bill. My internet and phone service has been down for several days at a time - more than a few times in the past 2 years. I have had the cable modem changed out 3 times in as many weeks. Each time I was told the modem did not work or was not the modem. Regarding my bill that was supposed to be consistent if I agreed to a 2 year contract I have called almost on a monthly basis in an attempt to correct. Every month I am told one or a combination of these excuses: 1 - The previous agent did not code it correctly. 2 - The previous agent was incorrect. 3 - The previous agent made notes but did not complete the changes/corrections.Each month I am promised that they would make the proper corrections. The future bills would be correct. I am given exact dates when it will change. Some have even given me their direct phone #. Last month my calls were never returned from this direct #. And yet this months bill was almost double the amount. I have spent dozens and dozens of hours on the phone. Not counting service calls. Even calling Comcast Corporate (BTW the last person not to return a call was the agent assigned to my previous complaint by Comcast Corporate). I have thought about switching to Dish or DirecTV. But they are rated #4 and #2 WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE respectively. I really enjoy the products. However, the time and extreme aggravation caused by the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE leaves me looking and wishing for an alternative."
"EDITH of Rockford, IL",5/10/2016,,"You use their modem, you get charged $10 every month. Still you dont use the Internet if you not buy the modem. You pay for a 75mega bytes speed, you get less than 30, you get upset and tired of calling them everyday and decide to buy your own modem and router. You mess up your speed even more and with on and off Internet connection and when you call them, they tell you itt seem to use any other company here because Comcast monopolized the service here in Rockford IL."
"conda of Richmond, VA",5/10/2016,,"I called Xfinity on 04/23/16 to transfer my service to my new home. I asked that a technician be sent to the new address, which I was told that it would be a self install. It's going on 3 weeks later, and no internet or TV service. They have the worst customer service ever."
"nadine of Alexandria, VA",5/10/2016,,"My rental apartment has a contract with Comcast therefore I have no option to select another company. I am contracted for 2 years; not optional. For the past 5 months I have had repairman after repairman come to my home. I donm a single female. These men get comfortable, text, tell you their divorce woes and so on. How long before I run into the one whot pay yet the little guy must pay for that which she does not get. I work hard for my $ yet my sweat benefits corporate America. They get 100% of their $ and a % of mine for no service rendered."
"keith of Milwaukie, OR",5/10/2016,,"Every service that I have with Comcast: tv, Internet etc. is borderline fraud. There is no customer service, Internet streaming is iffy at best. I could write a Dostoyevsky length novel of my complaints and utter disrespect that Comcast treats its customers. Why bother making a litany of numerical complaints that will be ignored. Comcast's business model is focused on shareholders and the quarterly report. This short term business model is ignorant, childish, and utterly incompetent. I will continue to use your ""services"" just to keep an eye on you. Malfeasance is a prosecutorial crime."
"Latasha of Hartford, CT",5/10/2016,,My mom has Comcast Cable. I help my mother pay the bill. We never missed a monthly payment. Bill was paid on time every month but for some reason bill never got lower only high... I moved to a new location in February. I had to wait for them to get a date to transfer my services here where it get interesting. They wanted like 4 month to transfer a balance from my old address to my bill and because they wanted so long to do this my bill is skyâ€™s the limit. I feel it should be a law against company prorating people bill because they don't how much cable someone going to watch for the month. Something need to be done about how much they charge people to watch cable. Company need to realize not everyone work and some people are on a fix income so to charge all the money for cable make no sense. I feel like they should be put on some time of investigation because when you pay a bill it suppose to go down not get higher when you put money on it.
"duane of Woodstock, GA",5/11/2016,,"Do Not trust these people. Lie cheat and steal. Cannot be trusted and no customer service. Your bill will be a lot higher than what is negotiated. Had them for one month, then dropped them like a hot potato. Did NOT sign any agreement, only verbal, so if they try to come after me, will sue them. Every thing on tape."
